of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to an al hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for a day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty to state and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know that and that that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant erode districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and now they're unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or is that why you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with turnout hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that front\nAnd they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nBut not one of the ... all

I'm a manager and I you know twelve direct reports\nUm honestly cam I don't think meetings need to be called very often because I should have a standing time already on the schedule for me and my twelve people I mean it that's super important let let's say for example\nOn every other week or we're going to sit down for an hour and a half as a team I don't know how you can run it affected department if you're not doing that if you're either a trying not to have meetings\nOr you're just randomly calling them when something comes up those are not going to be affected meetings unless you know unless you just need to do a quick information distribution\nPiece said that's fine everyone get together for ten minutes has something to tell you that's that's totally okay but you know if you're going to\nHave a team that's functioning and brainstorming and\nBenefiting from each other's ideas wisdom and and good communication you've got to have a standing time\nWith your people and the good thing about that as you can prepare those and I almost had a template and and get some assistance the and actually have a meeting that everybody you know walks away from every other week saying yeah those were better because of the leading\nSo I I'm not sure I'm not sure that you need to do a lot of calling of meetings as opposed to having a really established the culture\nSo scheduled meeting every two weeks is what you suggested right now so that the team can but he knows it's coming there is no surprise and I would suspect that you believe the format the structure of the meeting needs to be the same each time\nA which said a reason yeah I I\nTake that you know for example um you know let's let's take a\nCouple of minutes at the beginning to do sort of an icebreaker which might be something very work related you know what let's everybody's share sort of a success from the last couple of weeks or um you know or it could be something a little lighter if you're if you're a ... a well oiled machine and you want to take a minute to you know hey what's up you're looking forward to this summer [noise]\nUm but then from there yeah move into sort of a template\nMeeting that would include um\nYou know less less uh less follow up for example we've got some stuff hanging out there from last meeting let that that might be the first thing on our template agenda you know let's let's let's uh\nKinda dot the I's and cross the east from last week we left a couple of things done and then the next thing might be\nA the managers time to just share some things you know this is the stuff that was decided in you know the executive team last week any or something that's coming up and so it's time to really get some information out there and make sure there's no questions and or at least answer the questions [noise]\nUm than you might have a time of um you know one of the reasons that people should be needing together is to do work together for example we might do some problem solving we might\nIt might be the the week where we're gonna um do some brainstorming about how to improve our relationship with the other department over there that we tend to have struggles with and [noise] or it might be the\nThe ... this this this time we're going to spend some time working on our customer service practices you know let's do a little bit of work is brainstorming and didn't make some improvements so you know a part of that meeting every other week should be interactive\nLet's work together to solve the problem let's become a stronger team let's fix it off as you know et cetera and then you might move into 'em\nThere might be a a bit of training there might be um I guess ah someone from another department that wants to come in and share some things\nUm then it might be a time where everyone kind of goes around and and and shares or something that's on their plates or something that they need some help with um everybody kind of has the floor for maybe a bit [noise] um you might uh definitely and a couple of things and this is real important I'm\nMost meetings fail I Believe or or are ineffective because we don't end our meeting with what I call the ABCD at the at the at every meeting\nYou should go over for things and these are supposed to be redundant or\nA prompt either one so a stands for action items you what what did we what are we discussing this meeting that requires somebody to go do something let's make sure we reiterate that let's make sure to get that written down um the beef stand for ... and ...\nSo so let's make sure that our action items are really clear you know who's doing it what's the timeframe\nOr just the stands for um communication item sweat what did we discuss in this meeting that we want to make sure that we deliver outside this meeting you know what's the message and and who's delivering the message to home\nThe deep sea has for decisions what did we decide and maybe we didn't decide but we could of it was so here's a good time to say oh yeah you know what we were really close to deciding but we just sort of spending circles let's\nLet's make that decision right now I'll tell you what am I I'll I'll I'll tell you that I've seen several organizations by just adding a B C D I'm to the end of their meetings as a practice they have radically improved the effectiveness of those meetings\nYeah I can imagine they'll let me ask you a couple of things first you said a go around the room a couple of times get everybody involved\nAre you a believer that there should be a meeting the leader and ah and and then they give time to the other people around the table to speak or is it all the leader drives the meeting\n[noise] um I I guess I Would say two things one is I absolutely believe that good meetings have good facilitators I I I Believe that managers and and and\nOne of our core beliefs that organization is that managers being a manager is a skill and there's a there's a tool belt and a lotta people get promoted we talked about the last time right all of a sudden you're a manager and it ... you don't know how to manage and good luck\nGood luck with that and one of the skills and manager really needs to have this meeting facilitate shouldn't because we've all been to those meetings that are run\nTerribly or are you know death by PowerPoint meetings or you know a person who doesn't actually know how to facilitate I I Believe that a meeting is going to be effective and enjoyable to the degree that your\nLeader knows how to um share the floor had to draft at an air traffic control how to deal with problems behaviors how to keep everybody focused and on track on the agenda so on one hand yes you've got to have a leader a leader you got to have a facilitator he knows how to facilitate and to the other point\nThat person has to know how to air traffic control and share the floor and get people involved and that means putting people in Paris sometimes and saying hey talk to the person next to you an answer this question and processing together then we'll get back together\nOr it might be let's go around and everybody's share their thoughts about this or that this person a sort of leading the orchestra [noise]\nUm they're not so I thought a solo\nView I Want to talk a little bit more about that when we get back from breaking a most people are fans of short
