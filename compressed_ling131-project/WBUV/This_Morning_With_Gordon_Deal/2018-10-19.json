Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman says here's one likely reason his options aren't good in some choices could actually backfire on Mr Trump in the final days before the U.S midterm elections Rick how to use it\nMuslim world is outraged about this for church if President Trump does not seem to be first they said there will be severe consequences if this turned out to have been a a murder or perpetrated by officials in in a Saudi Arabia and now he's saying\nOh I don't know about that maybe it was a band of road kill or the French and the king say they don't really know about it I'm inclined to believe them\nSo he's really changed his story and I think it has a almost everything to do with his effort to uh intensified sanctions on Iran and the need for the Saudis to increase oil output remember where it just a few weeks before the midterm elections\nAre Trump's new sanctions on Iran go into effect on November fourth that just two days before the midterm elections that will actually take some oil off the global markets pushing prices up\nA Trump does not want to have to explain rising oil and gasoline prices right before the election so he really needs a Saudi Arabia to make up for the last Iranian production and I think that's the backstory here\nYeah All right so what are some levers he could push if he decides in fact two men out some punishment\n[noise] ... ah right so there have been many calls for some kind of sanctions against Saudi Arabia now of course there has to be some kind of official finding within the U. S. government or that or this was an official act in other words and officially sanctioned murder\nUm so I think one thing Trump can do is just wait until the elections are over on November ... I I think that the timing would actually work\nUh you know he can say look we're we're going to do a thorough investigation make sure we really not what happened then that could easily take you another four weeks or so so that this will whatever happens comes after the elections in which ... which point he has a little more freedom\nAnd then you have to say well what would what what kind of sanctions would these be\nUh I don't think we've ever actually put limits not in not in the last thirty or forty years anyway we've never sort of put an embargo on um Saudi oil coming to the United states I think it's hard to imagine that happening but the United states has done with regard to human rights abuses in other countries\nThey have sanctioned particular companies say you could make it hard for that companies do business to do business\nAnd that's where you say well they can't uh we don't want them doing a business for us financial institutions that ... that can um you know really a cause some pain and then there's this other thing called the Magnitsky Act which was originally passed by Congress\nAh with regard to Russia but that can be used with other countries as well and that allows the U.S government put sanctions on individual cell you can say\nA certain named individuals are not permitted to do business with us financial institutions anywhere and that you can see their assets in the United states if they have any and do some other things that are they the government here is use that against some Russians are and it's pretty effective it makes life very complicated for the targeted people\nAnd we're speaking with Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman this piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um how easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly that are there any sanctions on us we are going to respond with what they said that words were greater action and you know I think they're clearly referring to oil prices so they hatch people\nIt within Saudi Arabia sugar speaking on behalf of the ruling family they're saying you know we can only do prices right now west Texas crude is around Seventy dollars\nAre they are saying that we could easily just restrict supply and prices go up to eighty dollars a hundred dollars um you know the Saudis are are still the biggest oil producer in the world and they could\nThey could easily restrict supply enough to push oil prices almost as high as they want to so when they do that um I you know I\n... it's hard it is really kind of head scratching because it's a little bit hard to see this outbreak of sort of oil or petroleum warfare to ah when all these countries really do need each other I mean
