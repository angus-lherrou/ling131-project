to justice capital and his family for how we got up\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so you are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say and the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and\nYou know the whole process just isn't that sort of process it reflects terribly well on the court and enter the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court drew the meeting her pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow do you steer it though 'cause I mean there's ... you ever see any of these Supreme Court justice was like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead\nOf trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruined it doesn't it's not so sweeping\nIt is to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times it on an issue that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nThe you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMe to the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now [laughter] and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean uh two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now ... all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter]\nJust like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be\nJust to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and end up for common ground with [laughter] you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly that that

helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr Judas or loss\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening that many people are highly unpack and what they do at the heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat ... into their own body and a lot of their past traumas that trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens and it's kind of\nAction and and horrific situation take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash and it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize\nThat you are not that the hearts and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell and that kind of thing it's done some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror\nNeurons are the compassion their own in the brain [laughter] I'm I'm past that fry at such a ... ... standing impact and thought that mirror neurons compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons\nGet activated that much more showing highly impact the paper\n[noise] so how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you because you're an impasse\nTo set those boundaries well one thing I suggest all night and pat patients to take this fast\nYou know not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on friday a stress negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature meditate exercise Brandon laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just note past traumas um\nTriggered for instance you know if you lost your father and\nYou know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know the different though 'cause they could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also\nDoing a lot to help nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to go outside\nUm learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then pass don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever you have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around\nEnergy vampires will I write about destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy caused\nThemselves long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely an impasse who don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book can be kind of course they never want to go outside they had panic disorders they can add to this is a lot of the decision is because there are sensory overload all the time or\nWhat they are just getting bombarded and don't know how\nTo stop it and so I Believe the empathy is a trait that's going to save the world I really do I feel so strongly about it it's something I teach all my patients how to develop um and\nYou have to be living to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing his he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the

is actually say that it's traveling to the international cheap the issue conference in Orlando with Trump or that it's something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that he's in France for the G ... summit which is kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell is there are conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nUm I think they wouldn't normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know just allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment a session to it you know prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies will be getting credit from conservative but that's not necessarily happening at this time\nAnd I said you were speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein you said too that ah there's going to be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the field after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think right now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now it's about you know whether\nTrump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to write down on their own accord so it just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get a fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of keeping the present appealing but president in such a way that he's been able to keep her job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally true rated for that little bit different\nWhen you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about that day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean catching is recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed about getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know such and such you know not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of\nUm you know separated him from the department that hate me at a time when it's getting involved at some of the biggest you know stories of the day like immigration I guess well\nRosenstein and hit the answer to a lot of the complaints from Trump and his allies session has really gotten to execute it agenda you know Pete relative quiet because the focus is on ride and what he's doing\nAnd says that shouldn't just kind of just been you know traveling talking to one group I'm getting that he really likes and stay out of the cauldron of Washington\nAnd he said he it's

Street journal reporter chip cutter has been sampling workplaces ... says beef stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal ... what have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example\nAh that that they weren't really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues [laughter]\nWe have we sampled in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault [noise] um one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates waiting to read it to a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something\nThat really couldn't be awarded at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it cause enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[noise] well we heard a talk to one person for example she works at a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front of her were walking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to\nSuddenly redirect conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work that's\nThat's that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right you eat it at work avoid religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is politics app stay out of work for a number of people are tired of it but it's no wonder ... that you do bring out he was home to the office that the issues you're you're discussing outside of work of course we're going to become a into the workplace\nAnd one person I spoke with made a point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of pre counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I found interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slack room that had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers they're really engaged in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat well for me what you cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers uno may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nDetroit I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team but there really is just no please for political bickering network\nHe's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are these are gender issues it but I think but we we heard on on all sides of this that they were men kind of coming to twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that a cat and I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having this conversation so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out at work where we spend so much more
