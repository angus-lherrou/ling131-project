serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and uh\nI was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people\nHe communicated with well see an friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions says I have and so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent through about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nFor many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there was a political violence\nCommitted by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz and highly cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion\nIt's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the end I semi settled a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and shared calling Jews termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and broccoli saying Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and ...\nThat's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a Bowers is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes ... hours has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nBy thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding in the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough aids ... diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\nJerry was sixty six sixty six doesn't sound to me he had a lot of life in front of him you know he really did he had he he was only just beginning to think about retirement\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers also honoring the eleven lives lost before their game against the Cleveland Browns broadcast on CBS Sports\nBut this week in June and\n[noise]\nIn Paris the president of the union of Jewish students of France Sasha Gosling calls for solidarity\nShows go to the grieving something\nCool the French government and the older brother moved across Europe because of the U.S [noise]\nTo stay strong ties regions again try this or\nHigher learning institutions in Paris dealing with anti Semitic graffiti the alleged shooter forty six year old Robert Bowers reportedly shouted all Jews must die before opening fire he faces twenty nine counts of federal crimes including hate crimes\nThe Florida Man arrested for a national a nationwide bomb scare is expected in court Monday Fox is still Keating\nFifty six year old Caesar say odd remains locked up in a small cell tomorrow will be taken across Miami Avenue to the U.S court house where he'll have his first court appearance before a federal magistrate\nTheir faces five federal counts including illegal mailing of explosives and making threats against former president in this case that's Brock Obama and Bill Clinton\nHe suspected of mailing fourteen ... pipe bombs inside\nThose bonds Santa outspoken critics of President Trump FBI fishes\nNot disclosing a motive but seeing the devices were not a hoax this is Fox News this is talk one off or not\nThe nation's homeland security secretary says recent events such as the male bonds and the deadly synagogue shooting or threats an action not to be tolerated in this country for any reason\nThe deaths in the synagogue shooting coming on the heels a mail bomb investigation is something secretary ...

UBS\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nThen the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants who's now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal in Oregon I don't buy political agitator is an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time\nAt a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up

that the major media will do it\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro

and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tests\nA four year with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media
