I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a site this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting at a rate matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate\nBut ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother has a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward\nThey completely fall apart they don't exist\nThere is no cooperation and so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and\nShow you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late

Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue

Fox News Simon character this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is from Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly met one of these talks before nine WB is the\nRadio station and the great American\nI'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them to rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham\nTo be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen and Lisa Murkowski you made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees when the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh was wife his mom and dad is girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting you're accused was all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak\nFrom the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett open gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure\nYeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years I wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography in St I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why do they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ever noted the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they didn't have one criminal parts should against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nThe porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars in\nThe Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct but every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin all but the but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been bred Kevin all you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and made Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nHeaded to the seventh inning with the Dodgers leading the series two games to none in game three of the other LDS the

two weeks ago then I'm of course a man and you may be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feelings Deb George your husband and your dad\nYour brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world\nWhere because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed in other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up\nThere was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my dad and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house Roseburg colorized or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or reject\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was the timeframe it happened in\nThe two front door was a kind of hard but fearing the fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in fact she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself oh hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and a one and not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do with Koester phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia to Haiti and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie but there was nothing she said first later turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe is mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a lawyer\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused the

are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was Bryan maybe at it that was in its firing phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think are people like Brian saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do that nothing to get a power\nNumber two that Democrats socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change ... whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that we still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like them is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political forces the only way that we're going to

election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought accord sailor was going to win\nThen Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome and the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your

system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the ... and the companies that I made a fair for the next ... only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the

care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's like wonderful what the left and the Democrats\nHave indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nOver mine this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for\nThe situation that we're in your Catholic as a mile or are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in these sects abuses and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those laws and we should be able to

that have the Freedom Tower the church in this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties the late twenties and for\nTwenty years I introduced into the seminary placed in the American Catholics seminaries one thousand one hundred men who were communists and\nOr no or low faith or morals and according to the plot many who were ...

president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban to run against\nAnd Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\n... ... you know but I don't come in and got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems

violence where we're at Bernie Sanders supporters shooting GOP senators or the baseball is already gone weird Rand Paul thrown off for ... you're right it's already happened and I'm ... where does this thing and\n[noise] well I wrote a piece on this week about ah this\nThis so called I'm paid in\nTurn have worked Sheila Jackson representative Sheila Jackson Lee either not an ... hate and turn this is the individual who was arrested\nFor duck thing and as you know doc thing as a document and drop it it's a it's revealing the private addresses or email or phone numbers\nOf private ah that Public Citizen says that this was done to three United States senator to sat ... who are are currently sitting on the Judiciary Committee considering\nThe cabin on nomination um and this individual who was who docks these uh senators\nWas working for Sheila Jackson Lee now what I found I was so fascinated by that's when I first heard about this it seems very weird\nTo hear about a twenty seven year old intern\nIn my time on the hill I worked on the health for eight years I hadn't I never seen a twenty eight year old there twenty seven rather twenty seven year old insurance and then when I sat deeper I realized it wasn't in charge with so called a fellow actually paid\nFight outside organization now if you know he was dead it is very creepy he ... he threatened members of the Senate has found him I'm On computers it it is an unbelievably scary stories and of course that the mainstream media is not at ... any questions about this\nWas this outside organization paying him ... this is Sheila Jackson Lee she is a disgrace in the house by the way she ... she is where people go when their careers are about to die and and and yet this guy was employed by her\nHe was unpaid he paid by an outside organization no one's asking questions about this what was the outside organization these questions that have to be revealed these are these were answered the American public deserve and well his organization paint this this this\nPerson and he ended up duck thing he ended up having\nThree United States senators why is no one\n... the organization that paid hes\nI didn't tell you why of course the mainstream media ... where does agree but you you're saying your column among among other things\nThat are Jackson Costco or might be a democratic operative paid by outside organization planted in an unpopular Congress woman's office\nJackson Lee to do as much damage as possible you didn't pick any Democrats the only picked Republicans and he may public private information about where the senators live their telephone numbers their their wives and their children or whatever in order to cause the mob the pay mob\nThat was scratching at the doors of the same court on Saturday and the pay mob confronted Senator Flake in an elevator the that that is paid outraged individuals he's part of that uh George Soros group in which\nThe end justifies the means and you can imagine if a Republican operative Morgan for working for a I don't know US Senator Graham of South Carolina\nPaid by an outside group would dachshund make public private information about female US Senators all hell breaks loose with the mainstream media but the New York times Washington Post CBS I have no interest in this because it doesn't fit their agenda\nIt's astonishing to me as I look through that I

house and we're almost shocked that\nThe school he was almost killed and we have a a Democrat in at Democrats office ... his publicizing the the the home addresses\nOf Republican sitting on the Judiciary Committee and nobody cares [laughter]\nMission to me the media's not care Democrats don't care Republicans are knowingly silent on as well I think Republicans should be demanding more answers I don't think that we have\nYet Cory Booker you have Maxine Waters you have or and you have Camilla Harris other Democrats who are encouraging the behavior it Matt and me it is incredibly credibly matinee\nThat there's no accountability here not in not playing\nOn and Cory Booker and one of the morning shows along with around ...\n... ... they cannot bring themselves to say do not stoke do not confront do not yell out in private and probably about ...\n... ... ... they're encouraging this kind of behavior and I fear for Senator Susan Collins is life I think because of what you
