migrants streamed through southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly ... bought them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nIs made an end run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about the gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans suddenly like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here and because the way the law is constituted\nThat are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they will permit it they will permit\nBecause if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we're not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here legally you mean taken right back immediately if you're from central\nAmerica you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so ah I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change their coverage\nTo provide objective information the damages caused\nBy unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTexas through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world was because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right\nNow with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunity to you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press as these we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America takes the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat's the most violent places on earth and sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out\nThat this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have the benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely\nNot we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to another citizen up men demand rights are you kidding me\n\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks and two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be Corey Lewandowski\nWho was the Trump campaign manager for a year and a half and twenty six team did a great job I'm going to have ... plus Kevin Jackson twenty

border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of hope that the poor you know by the time spring hits him\nBecause of the Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves you shouldn't use that real army and I think the plan is they want to be like another ... kinds of thousand troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry store of it like storm the Mexican border a few days ago I Would put it in a token effort to hold them twenty four hours or ... the U.S and deal with Mexico because Trump has got a straight in Mexico are true at all these

financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or NBC News I'm thinking they're thinking this was playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizen to take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nAnd Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I

conned boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing that also how Obama drone American citizens like this Ella we eat guy kill and blow 'em up\nYou know trial no ... no execution and then the media doesn't saying no doubt that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know ... ... ... it's in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club against Trump they'll do it but\n... out of wacky being killed by Obama is no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior in that part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists\nAnd then I hear about ... show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why did why more valuable than a comfortable life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's backed a stand against the oil as political opponents right both Porsche and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed the face their supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says African Business conference that Obama held rip fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR\nThey just fall over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of the stuff's bought ... leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would

Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president a privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I sit on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that guns do you give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump he's truly cares about other people he's extremely magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media\nIs the worst human being on the planet but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen so many times\nHelping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever we can\n... why is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and the ministry of the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more American working than any other time in our nation's history conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about here is a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with least offer sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him the five times during that interview to put that in comparison when she missed during an interview with a bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit they deserve the successes that he can because they no longer in\nAnd this of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed in his mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh all along about a trucks\nThat ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen it with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence say antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over four million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally is acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records and that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just getting about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nNew you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the Congress if Donald Trump\nThe last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back and plays she'll ring a system just like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production and about two weeks

men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too is a bunch of left this letter it's Hollywood left these [laughter] okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on the news and these\nOld school actresses and all these pop political feminists\nTaking pictures at Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting me to\nA ends up being a bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against ah the high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster\nChild I mean it just it pours me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms of physicians would somebody a Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama selected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein had access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughter's into the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama telling you is\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that electorate slap this who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale for many many boys I've said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen\n'cause some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he is not going to be insignificant to him and her but because something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it's it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas and in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nMore in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars damage Thirteen other gang bangers to provide the passage every time you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers in the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign or buy a Tom's dire and by Bloomberg and others\nIn order to uh to me are Republicans all over the counter and get get get get me over the next two weeks you mean how's this going to play out I like to early on November the sect\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate [noise] people want our border protected and so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand how\nAnd so what prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get through you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we are going to look at the age were able to send you\nSome Mexico the polling military on the southern border got just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it Honduras I bet you will send buses the say\nYou get it you're going to get back to our country or else and and ... what the lay out they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand\nThey think that some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point\nWith Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horse to think that they can just come anytime they want so whether whether it's the kind of effect\nOr whether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's this farce of an investigation of the Russian they'll which we now see that that is completely been busted part because the judge Royce Lamberth\nWho just said I don't understand how Cheryl Mills isn't in prison and Clinton a bunch of others and then there's a conspiracy what the FBI so that's about to break that's going to be the big story this week\nAnd then you've got this yet again read a guarded Haitian of the whole border issue that Trump's going to send troops and say you're not going in no\nIn fact on doors you know Kevin Jackson it's bad for a hundred doors in Guatemala and Mexico\nThere's ten uh males generally males to America because it takes away the ability of Hondurans to reform their own government because the safety valve is there to send people to other countries and so what's left are those who\nThis is a border there's already overwhelmed just

simply continue\nThe other night on Fox on watching and uh the speaker made a comment the expert on the administrative agency slashing the Congress\nThat made the comment that every year in matter who's the president somebody like three thousand new rules are put into effect by the alphabet soup federal government agencies and uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different than what the founding fathers and then at what the constitution did not invent\nThe consequences of not necessary rules and regulations the costs the American economy billions of dollars every year\nThe constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThe the the the the agencies that the federal government or the state government agencies were mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect and that as a consequence we Americans\nAre going to question the legitimacy of their own government when it's completely on accountable or good men Peter Wallison is written a book judicial fortitude or subtitled but last chance draining the administrators state and uh Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the bill Cunningham show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks to go to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got a the fifth conservative vote on\nThe Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing and in his writings and the second circuit court of appeals where he was for twelve years Brett Kavanaugh often knocked down the administrative state ruled by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAre the minister the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department [noise]\nAll the way down to the FCC and there are hundreds of them and the way that they impact their lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations on staff\nIn many cases generations old and those rules and regulations are not only credit for all that is there are many of them\nBut they have a major effect on our lives and the purpose of the book that I had written is to explain that the we have to rein in in in some way\nAnd it was ... when the when you when you say we have to train them in who is we\n[noise] uh well the American people have to bring them in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way to do it is through the court system and that's why your point about a\n... a Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road\nOf the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrator state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they're able to make\nYou give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the Irish but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so\nIt's ... in acting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules a day now must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of\nHarm in the sense of for a business is of course it it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for businesses one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses or from individuals each year\nSo this is a very significant thing um but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe [laughter] the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital fortitude they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe
