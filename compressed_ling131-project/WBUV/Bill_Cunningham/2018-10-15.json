Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who cripple the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married\nIt goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy tests and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWay of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party and so\nThen I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ...

they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nThe truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is

twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African\nAmerican men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic

Fox News\n[noise] [noise] I'm an Carrick and this is Fox News\n[noise]\nThis is Kelly ban it from ... mornings with uncle Henry on these tough one for nine W. B. B. and heart radio station\n[noise]\nFirst of all\nYou have a long distance relationship here or do I ... a hedge swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job restricts it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it and find a garden that's right right by since Saturday going over so there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow is gone the whole thing including the garbage everything's on what's going to happen with the mega housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama said one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now about\nYour wife is good your lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on me and the other thing the mid west\nAnd looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than it used to what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refuse to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nAre so many jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually I Will be talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent the Arabs they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "15"}
