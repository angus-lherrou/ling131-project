I don't mean to interrupt but I Know what\nThey were going to have more this\nTime of it I Know we can lay out the case for hours look they were stolen for two weeks for simple reason they had Meryl Streep give their acting lessons you know someone like Meryl Streep has been co chair and co chairing coach you are probably a team of five people\nCoach here for two weeks to make sure that she was so monotone and so calm it's like they had to run for dean and they act like a little girl I mean with that that Senator Whitehouse\nI Swear to God I thought he was gonna say do you like a lollipop ... little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is filled with ...\nAnd ... now there's a couple of New York ... words mosques\nAnd buses who were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words by liberals they gave it to a woman a woman prosecuting Mitchell who was\nThe single worst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire like near you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would've destroyed or bill we would've had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case within ripped to shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent question at home in ... around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to see using a true you fly all the time yes or no isn't it true now you told us too many you needed a ten day break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington Post isn't it true you belonged yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness backed boy you\nSaid and the guy who came from you isn't there you go out there who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awake and and when your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about the security door is what made bring back your memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could've said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to who connected you at the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand\nQuestions they could've after ... you will they did after who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous they could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named\nThree potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve took out ads in newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced\nGinsburg's faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by make up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA\nIs it true your grandfather was CIA [laughter] is it true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true that bred Kevin O's mother a Maryland said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure and your parents who do you call\nIt kept me on that one 'cause they claim it was never quite for closed on and they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge the judge and incredible power over the future of her family's life and even though of actually they tend to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judges son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one is amazing that's not a conspiracy theory her dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a couple of it's with a law firm founded fusion\nGPS on all things considered and other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having said all that listen let's forget all that\nFor a minute forget forget he gave the most beautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my friends cry I've spoken to fifty are more women\nOn my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all said they cry because they've got sons and they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brett Kavanaugh outside and I believe any poll you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today my column in the Vegas newspaper which was featured at real clear politics\nAs one of the most important columns in America today over a hundred letters Ninety five percent of them were pro I Love your your great way and what you said about ... and and I'm with you and five of them were liberals and all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ... I Hope someone comes and murders you\nOr one of them had a great line they said I Hope there's a woman in your house and she grabs a night the plunged into your head out and mentally disturbed left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick people who will do anything and say anything because they believe\n... that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine for came forward and that's why the woman came forward and that's why the sick go charge gang rape came forward and the next five women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women\nWear pink vagina hats in March and anti Trump rallies who think they are saving the world by coming forward and lying it's as simple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout Jimmy Stewart it in the Andy Griffith and made very are empty he's a fine man at what they did it a character assassination and they're sick people there's something wrong with all of them\nDemocrats have men bill there's nothing else you could say we are target number one white straight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party simple\n... other provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on the loose the twenty five judges that would be on his list\nFrom what you would pick one of those twenty five million Supreme Court you might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that that uh because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump bliss during the campaign not also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality ... Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump blimp until November twenty Seventeen more than one year after the election his name was known in the list for her to react to December twenty sixteen but the media doesn't boy that out either\nYeah lives in the best case I think out of all of those out of all I mean they're all standing but the best one\nIs that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or they have that for the last days to see first that they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ...\nAnd and they're using the same deal they used against Clarence Thomas storm of the exact same playbook it's the same playbook\nAnd waiting for the FBI to produce this report we don't know how long it's going to take now the agreement is seven days\nA but at the FBI comes to the Senate and says it's going to take a little longer we're gonna have to do more thorough job here you can't imagine that the Democrats and Republicans would be happy about that but they say All right let's take the time the Democrats might be very happy about that frankly because you know the longer they can drag this out the worse it probably is for for Brett Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile Charles Chad lending ten now in North Carolina State University associate professor says he drank with Kavanaugh went both right yeah and that Kavanaugh was belligerent and aggressive when drunk and also it's had slurred speech and staggered from drinking he plans to speak to the FBI the investigation is to be completed by October fest [noise]\nWe have a trade deal the United states and Canada just confirming a new modernized trade agreement designed to replace the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA pack\nThe new deal will be called the United states and Mexico Canada agreements us MCA the Associated Press reports the agreement preserved a NAFTA dispute resolution process something the U.S wanted to jettison\nThe agreement exempt terrorists on two point six million cars on dairy candidate essentially gave us the same access and offered and the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by President Trump\nSteel and aluminum terrorists are not part of this agreement the U.S and Canada were under pressure to reach a deal by midnight Sunday when the U.S must make public the full text of the agreement with Mexico\nCanada the United states number two trading partner was left out when the U.S and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp NAFTA the north American free trade agreement Fox News this is talk went on for now he launched opinion [noise]\nSyria's foreign minister declares near victory over terrorism in says they are ready for refugees to return calling on the U.S France and turkey to leave\nSpeaking this weekend to the federal assembly the foreign minister called the United states an occupying force and that victory is near for the Syrian regime that they take back more territory from rebel groups this is the Trump Administration indicated this week that it can pull us presence on the ground in Syria is a strong possibility\nEven after the defeat of President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said the U.S will pull out through the Iranian forces have exited the cuts for\nThousands of Iranian backed fighters are currently operating on the ground in Syria adding to an already complex to wish that in the past month so increase tension after Syrian anti aircraft missiles accidently shot down a Russian plane was aiming at Israeli fighter jets and Jerusalem trading Fox News\nOld man winter paid a visit to the state of Montana as other parts of the country continue to enjoy the sunshine Fox meteorologist Adams clots\nWe're looking at Boston Montana that theme from snowfall already so maybe a little bit more of a winter feel out in front of that you're looking at rainfall Foley across portions of the upper Midwest a kind of right along that for all about\nThe southwest in parts of Mexico will be getting a widespread heavy rain and flooding this week thanks to hurricane rose up a plan to re boot excuse me for a robot brothel in Houston needs a ...\nIt's the oldest profession with some new technology [laughter]\nNo you will find our to deter their instead the owners of the bravo called kinky dolls say they're human like robots are available for sale or rent and can talk they had wanted to open their first location in the U.S in Houston but the company whacked the permits required for demolition than construction of a new building\nAnd that's fine with Houston mayor Sylvester Turner you says it's not the kind of business he wants a new city ... Fox News ... Fox News radio [noise]\nThis is Henry From Gulf Coast morning with Kelly been wanting one for nine WVU the heart radio station\n[noise]\n\n\nI've only coming up the great American and are always good to get a female perspective to the men and women are equal but somehow were different all they're making more than I generally\nThink pretty much the same of Reagan babe dot com also great radio talk shows than Los Vegas Nevada and Meghan bars welcome again to the bill Cunningham show Megan how are ya\nI decorate them to\nGo I Want to get a woman's perspective I ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace did\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely wrong extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold in the impact it at our life and not have your article author this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally are respected I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch brought Kevin O's testimony and they're still in the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have Andrew Nepal a ton of and Karl Rove showing that a woman who's credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all when you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her and capability of flying which you flew everywhere\nBut every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility Megan bars it turns out to be great grossly locking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think my ... to Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because he wasn't on telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to the to your testimony nothing could swim in and then\nI found Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a raw emotion from falsely accused innocent man\nWho in the in the court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife was getting that threat and his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed\nAs well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for that age\nI she sat herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to cross the doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had this you know it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples\nOr just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rape or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start feeding additives\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount more judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what's the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running that didn't happen till November\nTwenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court when his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because ... ... exactly what were they watching\nAnd hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me what's kept glove no okay it was a very uncomfortable and hearing saw it talks about equal right on gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us
