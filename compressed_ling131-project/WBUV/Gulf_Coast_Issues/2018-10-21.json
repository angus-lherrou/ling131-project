convention of states his ear with details\nWhoever wins control of Congress next month likely will do so with a very slim majority I Will that affect the legislatures ability to govern Andy ... of the club for growth is here with a real story\nThe national debt has hit another new high should we be concerned every game of reason magazine talks with Brian ... of the Manhattan Institute\nAnd Democrats are approaching the mid term elections with very different strategies in urban and rural districts Dr ... from the center for vision and values that grow City College has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nMy looming Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe constitution of the United states can be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states and convention of states action is here to explain how a convention would work and why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we talk about a convention of states it's probably a process\nThat most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYeah you're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found in article five of the United States Constitution it was literally put there two days before the end of the convention in Seventeen eight seven and it's put their this idea of the state's getting together and convention put there\nFor the very purpose of pushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby two thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together colic convention get together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically the application we're pursuing right now which has already been passed in twelve states calls for physical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy and ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding of this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nThe real reason is is needed is then you referred to structurally broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing a structural reforms one great example is terminal and it's simply used to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for\nThirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate and so we didn't need term limits now we do need term us when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court\nThe justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four they didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally\nThose things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where are you going minute by minute is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about well\nI don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process but the other process for proposing amendments amendments have to be proposed by Congress so we're talking about is\nCongress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on at Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of him and so it would take two thirds of both houses to propose it\nTry to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nOr they haven't even been able to balance the budget and the lifestyle of decades let alone propose it so we need this convention of states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark one concern that has raised the as we do have as I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern that a convention of\nStates could go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by our constitution how would you protect against that well\nFirst of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly of anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states the sent them the states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate that comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds that could be stopped by their states and ultimately the founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything\nYou can do the math that run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find it amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified an even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed and tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to\nThe critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nAre so it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way they are which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already\nAnd so it takes thirty four to get into convention in convention it takes twenty six days to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is proposed amendment so people get all scared about getting into convention it's\nMerely a place where people can really make suggestions and then it takes thirty eight states to ratify anything that comes out of convention I think we're well on her way I think that one third mark is a pretty extraordinary landmark\nWe have passed and another Nineteen states in one house or the other you have to get both houses in a concurrent session so I think we're well on her way and I think we should expect to see some pretty extraordinary progress in twenty Nineteen\nMark if you go back in history and I realized and unfortunately it's not being taught at least to the degree it showed in many schools these days but tell us a little bit about the founding of the republic didn't the state's create the federal government and the other way around\nYeah look I think that's the history that's really important in the power pyramid was the state's created the federal government the state's essentially were to retain sovereignty they ... they were to have brought on ... powers the federal government was had to have limited any new worried it powers is now being reverse\nBecause of the rulings of the Supreme Court and really importantly in regard to the commerce clause the federal government can pretty much do anything it wants to do constitution\nAnd this is a big problem and and so we need to reverse that power pyramid take the power away from DC make it so DC is it so important I Would add one more thing there's so much conflict in strikes in this country right now politically I don't like it I don't think anybody likes it\nThe way you reduce that strife is quit making centralized decisions you take the power away from the federal government give it\nBack to the people in the states let them make the decisions at home we won't see these huge national fights anymore\nWe have been talking with mark Meckler who is the president and founder of convention of states and conventional states action so marked house just a little bit about convention stage organization where can folks also go on the Web if they want to learn more and get involved in the fight\nSure the project was founded just about five years ago\nAnd it was founded to take power away from DC give it back to the people people can read about it get involved at convention estates dot com it's supported by literally virtually every major conservative figure in the United states that's commented on out Sean Hannity\nMarco then Senator Tom Coburn Senator Jim demand lots of senators are fast and Rubio they understand that Washington DC isn't working in the way to fix it is take the power away from DC and get back to the people\nIf folks want to be involved in that they can do that a convention estates dot com\nMark Meckler from convention of states mark thank you for being here\nGood to be with you thanks for having me\nAnd the route that the club for growth are keeping an eye on all these congressional races we have going on around the country as well as US Senate races Andy\nGood to have you here I think family alum\nAndy as we've talked about many times Republicans currently control both the U.S Senate and the U.S house of representatives the Senate seems\nTo be headed more in the Republican direction but let's talk today about the house right now can you give us an overview as to how many seats Democrats would have to gain and where do they stand in achieving that goal\nThe Republicans are in charge of the house it appears that they are going to lose seats President Trump claims that there will be a red wave that will counteract that and to to be honest with you we are kind of seen some something of a red wave but the damn wave was so big\nLeading into the Kavanaugh hearings for the Supreme Court\nThat if a red wave does crop up it'll only reduce the demo have just to confuse the the analogy so right now Republicans are in the majority Democrats have to pick up twenty three seats\nI think that right now you can count about fourteen seats that will likely go down so that means the Democrats only have to pick up nine more and when you look at the population of seats from which says nine could come from you're looking at about twenty nine or thirty seats\nSo basically nine out of twenty nine nine out of thirty you're looking at about a third so to me it seems likely bar and everything else or all else being equal that the Democrats are going to pick up the majority but they will have a very slender slim majority perhaps single digits", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gulf Coast Issues", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "21"}
