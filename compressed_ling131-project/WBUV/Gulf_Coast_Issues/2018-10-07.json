P. protection and on a state owned enterprises a lot of the things that we claim we want to see from China\nOr the president was true from TPP and at that threaten to withdraw from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old now\nWas unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo bottom line here ... years this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvement for sure I mean this was a deal that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before the rise of e commerce and things like that that needed modernization some of a deal some of the still ... says\nAnd that's a good thing I mean there are some as I said the uh the slide opening up the dairy market for Canada is a good faith also it what it does is that it increases the threshold for selling stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low and so that's that's a good thing but the\nBalance like that that negative side as is probably worse than the good things are getting better get our base find was not\nThe old laptop pre President Trump\nYou may find that we have to look at now realistically as we were in a world where there was a potential in the west a phone lines drawn from NAFTA was a potential of the difficulty finding a resolution extreme chaos and uncertainty and that on the uncertainties that left ... dead yeah we can't meant\nThat fact that they're making things on their own worst fat and they and their reality when they go ship all different than it was going to rock the boat for better or worse and now we can hope for\nAt least a more peaceful environment\nWhile at the very least another items checked off of the to do list that we have been talking with ... who is a senior research fellow with the Mercator center that at George Mason university and burning tell us a little bit about the Mercator center also where folks and go to read your writings on this and other subjects\nThe center for market research that are based at George Mason university and non partisan and redo economic stuff we started with rank and I had a long time ago and we are at ... or you can read all my stuff\nThere but I I doubt creators colon I'm syndicated and its creators I I'd like to corner and I also write a con for a reason magazine and sometimes I write for the New York times\n... there were the other Mercator center Veronique thanks as always for being here thank you for having me\nAt the offices of the club for growth in Washington DC Andrew Roth is keeping an eye on US Senate races and congressional races all across the country and we're going to take an update one month before election as to where things stand\nAndy good to have you here thanks for having me lemon\nLet's talk first about the U.S Senate it's been it's been an interesting couple of weeks for the Senate Republicans have a little bit of an advantage by virtue of the map you might want to just give us a bit of an overview on that and then we can talk about how things are going in the individual states\nYou're right Republicans do have an advantage right off the bat thoroughly defending eight seats or nine seats rather and the Democrats are defending twenty six so just right off the bat or they're in good shape plus at least ten Democrat ... seats that are up for reelection\nTrump won and some of them Trump won big time like West Virginia\nAnd North Dakota so the Republicans are definitely in the driver's seat now there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of spending involved and there's a lot of good candidates that were recruited involved so it is making this situation a little bit more difficult for Republicans\nThey have a fifty one forty nine advantage in the Senate which is very slim the best guess right now is that perhaps they'll pick up one or two seats\nBut I could easily see them picking up more than that or\nHaving the election be a complete washer nobody wins or loses net seats and I could even see Democrats picking up a net one or two seats so it's getting married\nSo a month out nothing is settled in the situation is going to remain voluntary right up until election day let's talk first of all in the in terms of all these democratic seats that are up\nWhich states are finding that their incumbent democratic US Senators are the most vulnerable and perhaps subject losing to a Republican challenger\nYeah I think first and foremost a you have to look at North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is the Democrat there she's trying to portray herself as a moderate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gulf Coast Issues", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "07"}
