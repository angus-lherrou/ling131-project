unemployment statistics which found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do sort through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grows they're naturally trying to better their situation\nThe only way they can is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually have the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety and so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign in some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep\nEconomic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings to low low you're hearing about a smaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find\nGood workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's always the case a growing economy generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward to fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet but\nMy generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay and that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never\nWorry about that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and uh although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors probably like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that it didn't bring it back Trump largely brought back what we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor that constantly sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made in North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without\nA meddling there's a little bit of central planning in the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that but let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact that has a just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nI'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit\nThat's the equivalent of married ablaze you said in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords couldn't charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed\nThe fed to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally it in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort\nAnd that sort of an outlier position but I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years\nThe fed has been on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to skin or the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that cause the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNow I don't think it will have much of an impact in all let's remember the fact kept rates low about Syria or the rate at any set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources the trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all\nHuman labor that that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with\nThe fat as just another entity trying to influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John Tammy who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John tell us about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from your\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are changing them that they basically see what they're dealing\nAnd your website is\nW. W. W. freedomworks dot org John\nTammany freedomworks John thank you for being here thanks for having me and the route that the club for growth keeping an eye on what's been a fascinating last few weeks in the nation's capital to say the least dandy good to have you here\nHi thanks for having lemon Brett\nKavanaugh's now and associate justice of the Supreme Court in the United states but the political ramifications likely are going to be felt for weeks as we head into the general election Andy is the Kavanaugh confirmation process is this going to be an overall plus for Republicans\nWell it is so far I mean obviously we get a a conservative justice that will help make the court of conservative majority\nThat could last very long time and who knows ... may even get another pick before the end of his first term but with regards to politics there's evidence that Republican voter enthusiasm has picked up you saw some recent polls that showed\nThat the percentage of voters who think this election is very important use to be de plus ten meaning the Democrats are ten percent more enthusiastic to vote the Republicans and that has shrunk to D plus too since the ... in a fight so if a Republican show up at the polls\nWas just as much enthusiasm as Democrats\nThan the Republicans will keep the house and they will likely add to the Senate majority so the Kevin a thing as a big deal and let me point out that the Democrats want to politicize it to the Jerry ...
