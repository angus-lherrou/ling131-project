just wanted to save me a little work there\nOn this week's edition of the city desk pod cast from the city of Alexi they focused on the status at the singer theater and some repairs and other city issues so we're going to start out by sharing that with the\n\n[noise]\nCity desk news and views from city hall Biloxi and now the host of our program city desk\nPublic affairs manager for the city of Biloxi Mr Vincent ... good morning was to grill the morning William\n... we are recording this program on Thursday October twenty fifth and it's ten thirty six in the morning here for the city hall and joining me after a week long\nSabbatical is Cecelia dogs' fault and public affairs specialist for the city of on the\nMorning you jump right into yesterday and I'm going to say that again what's going on with the sangre theater\nAnd the thing is a theater um they are continuing to work on repairs for this thing and theater and then kind of a long process but there is a process to go to in the city wants to make sure that everything is done to correct\nWhat they have done is they have reviewed the outside of what we're parents that are needed in addition to that they had to go in and find out what\nThe structure was made up a\nIt was not a lot of good detailed information that was on bombing them in the building was like Nineteen twenty nine we've had storms and hurricanes and stuff like that so they had to go and be fine detailed information and then they also had to actually go in and find out what destruction was night so that has taken a while\nAnd that research that they find anything like historical old switches papers documents Markey's old letters I mean that places now\nLetters but they did find some old they were talking about an old information like that\nBut but what I'm told that they don't allow that to now where they're at right now is they are the engineers architects are working with the history and our guys to find out what materials they can\nUse to repaint make these repairs they also see the need for repairs to their\nFlight power which is the back part the kind of tell her back part not going to\nDo and what was the ... whenever you go see a production and they're changing the SATs when they raised two sets high up in the air that's where they go into the\nTower and they see that that part needs the most immediate attention\nSo they're going to work on repairing that question I think at the ... material sees hopefully the ads will go out into the here and work with out in the\nBeginning of next year and be complete sometime next year\nAn abstract question but related that used to be a world class ... sangre brothers motion picture house [noise] and they're still holes in the wall in the back et cetera are they thinking about restoring that you can actually show movies\nActually what they did is do their research and they found a lot of old newspaper articles in photographs of what the outside in the inside look like back then in the Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirty\nAre they going to do their best to restore what they can do that too that air but then one thing\nWe we've had that fly tower and they're going to go out for the ads to repair the outside work which we've talked about that before that's just seal and the bread and and we pairing that and the reason\nThat I'm aging the AC on the race or we pay that and how well hopefully God did they sometime next year and of course once they complete that then they've got to work on the inside but they got to go through the process of evaluating what needs to be done and going out for bed and then working on that\nPart so it is a long process\nAnd they see the engineers architects knows that it is but we want to make sure that it is done right and that it will be able to be used for for years to come\nAnd we want to make sure people know that it's not just sitting over there there is work going on just because you can see it that is because they have to do the specifications\nAssociate you brought the specifications for construction and go out for beer and everything along every step of the way as you noted has to be approved by the Mississippi department of our cats in history and since that ... is on the national registry of historic places one interesting thing that came up\nIn the wake of Katrina whenever the city wants to make repairs to the inside of\nWhat the White House the bullets the White House as a cast iron structure but inside the\nThe the tunnel but to ... is a it's one with bricks and the issue was they couldn't just go by bricks off the shelf and the reason they couldn't use today's style bricks is because they are heavier\nThey are bigger so if you were to replace parts of the wall inside the White House with bricks made today they would crush the other ... because of the weight so they had to be careful in in what materials they're huge which\nIs another part of this anger process so it it's time consuming and it and it is a it it's something that's frustrating for people because the Gulf Coast symphony orchestras a great example they were supposed to start their season in September in the sangre\nThey started their season in September but they were not in the sangre John McFarland our good friend who is executive director of the Gulf Coast symphony said it's like a football\nTeam play every game as an away again much would appreciate everyone's patience\nAnd I said the city deck and other facilities such as the black sea visitor's center the down it's not as the ... center that day I have open for other groups that usually use the saying or where they can still have their events in Biloxi and went that spaces as well\nAnd remember folks when this is done with the amount of the city is detail you're going to have\nA benchmark you have a slice of Americana as a show place no one else will have goes back to the ball bill or a\nThink Nineteen twenty nine years or so\nThe one of the ways that we are going to pay for this is the mayor's been looking for our times in history money he's been looking for grant money are we thought we had some federal money tied up for it but to federal money was ruled as ineligible for that even though federal money had been used before\nThere's been a change in that determination but right now America which is proposing to the members of the city council people judge Judy going with the borrowing fourteen million dollars to keep major projects moving that we have been underway right now\nWe're talking about bricks and mortar stuff and we're talking about design and engineering [noise] a a large portion of the fourteen million or in that figures like five\nMillion would be spending more marketing on water Seward drainage sidewalks et cetera this goes along with the promises that the city made so long ago to upgrade all\nOf of the community to city level services that they expect and deserved a\nAlso in the fourteen million dollar bond is repairs to the cedar lake bridge the cedar\nLake bridge it it can handle fire trucks right now it can't\nHandle the waiting vehicles that may need to go across that seat or like bridge there seem to like bridges at the c._e._o. like exit go north probably about two or three miles it's what is known as a swing ... you know it's kind of candle even on a on a huge structure and the bridge swings open when boats come\nIt's a well while I'm rich fortunately it does not have to move to open a lot for marine traffic\nThe mayor is also looking at using some of the fourteen million dollars for upgrades of the main street braille crossing one important thing to know about the fourteen million is that a share of that fourteen million dollars\nIs the city's twenty percent match to get eighty percent in federal money so some of it is tied up in that their main street crossing is a great example of that market sidewalks as it is another great example\nOr two million dollars of the fourteen million dollars is allotted to the sangre theater to keep that were going on in the past we've talked about the new pope's very bridge we would like to see in one day we've talked about\nThe pending pending I say because it is going to be happening the extension of pops ferry road all the way down the highway Ninety\nWe've got design engineers who are looking at the right away we need to buy they are all making steps on these big projects even though they're years away even though we don't have the funding for the overall project\nYou still have to keep it moving and get it bid ready it's called to where it's ready to go out for beds when we do secure that money we want to be ready to go\nSo last year at the state of the city we made a big deal about happening now\nWell as my cornered said we want to be able to say happening tomorrow as well\nAre good reasons that the mayor's looking to move forward with this or fourteen million dollar bond borrowing fourteen million would require no tax increase the the money to pay it back\nIs already in the budget the money for the debt service it's called can handle or fourteen million dollar bond that is also well below our capacity football that\n[noise] so what they're looking to do is just keep projects moving so the mayor unveiled the solar noun stood to the city Council on Tuesday and Michael entered had also giving them a memo about here's what we're looking to do it seemed like it was well received by the city council", "show_name": "Gulf Coast Issues", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "28"}
