century of not just about a minute or so left here but let's I I'm just curious for your thoughts on\nLet's assume that that manmade global warming is actually a real thing what is the proper way to combat it in your mind\nA slow gradual weaning away from fossil fuels over time there are ways of doing it in their losses pathways and but the basic things to do with the figure out how to invest\nIn rehearsal developments to come up with energy sources that are in fact cheaper fossil fuel but one of the interesting things I found is that there is a scalable ... energy technologies that says her because certainly certainly throughout their goals are and that is is with their power and they basically dismiss it\nAnd I find that very puzzling because we know the scale of we'd rather cynically feasible and yet they just\nGo through complicated but we're not going to think about that because there was ever wanted to do is dot the landscape was total solar panels and and rent generation windmills what you want to do was to create and courses better outcomes you know if you do that\nYet of course out compete them without having to spend lots of subsidies and tax credits and all of that on those uh those other forms we are unfortunately were not there yet Ron Bailey from reason magazine thanks for taking some time to be near today the rise again\nAnd again that is Ron barely eat the science correspondent for reason magazine you can check out his latest piece for us at ... dot com how big of a deal is an extra half a degree of global warming find that again at ... dot com check out his book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century as well you can find that\nOn Amazon for reason magazine I married name we will catch a ride back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nCivility was the biggest casualty of the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings on this American radio journal commentary colonel Frank Ryan us embassy retired says it's time for elected officials to begin acting more like statesman\nThe past month to extraordinarily different yet related events played out in the American landscape one was a headline where's the other was just a footnote\nTo first event the confirmation process for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh exploded and fury in the American media and the public discourse the second event was the announcement of the ... the medal of honor\nTo sergeant major John Kennedy for his heroism in Vietnam decades earlier I was honored to receive an invitation to the sergeant majors award ceremony from my sergeant major Eddie nice the medal of honor is bestowed on those individuals\nWho I quote conspicuously by downed tree and interpreted the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty unquote surf was self sacrifice and without regard to their own life virtually every American respects the medal monitoring the significant self sacrifice that the award conveys it is this concept of self sacrifice while revered\nIs missing some noticeably from our society today I'm certain that are selfish preoccupation was instantaneous gratification have caused many of the problems we as a society face such a major can we fought valiantly in the battlefield to Vietnam\nAnd is finally being recognized for self sacrifice and devotion to duty his personal bravery serves as an example of what leadership is all about and reflects great credit upon himself his unit the United States Marine corps and the naval services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEver exhibited by United States senators and the history of our nation wide associate justice Kavanaugh did Nazis bullets emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in most offensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America\nThose very centered this new all too well the judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians and public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conduct unless actual ... says proven it as an almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court had to be willing\nTo subject himself and his family to horrific conduct by those opposed to his views if a nation is ever going to attempt to rebuild itself to very character of the nation must emphasize selflessness a moral code of decency\nAnd personal responsibility our national character as represented by great heroes like sergeant major Kennedy is under assault\nThis battle is more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival of the freedoms that we espouse in the bill of rights and for which such a major kindly and millions of others fought all of us in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend\nThe constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here said innuendo for political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin ... Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nThe different type of battle equally as important to when justice Kevin fought to protect the very fabric of the constitution he has sworn to defend by not backing down he convinced me of his moral courage in the face of unwavering criticism was the primary underpinnings in any civilized societies the presumption of innocence\nThis nonsense that the presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side a pundit very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law the sheer to publicity of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politician second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stripped from\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators was tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when a nation centered citizens into combat and into the military it has a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution\nTo military supported in harm's way whereas elected leaders\nAre obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress both arenas are critical if our nation is just survive only through our emphasis on self sacrifice moral courage\nAnd a personal accountability we're a nation survive our founding fathers left us a wonderful legacy what we do with that legacy is our decision an hour or so loan for the American radio journal this is Frank Ryan\nAmerican radio journal is hurt on public affairs minded radio stations all across the country they include W.

used on one oh four nine dot com\n\nGood voting and welcome to this week's broadcast of the Sunday Morning services averse Presbyterian Church in Gulfport\nThe whole testament God says I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I promise but he doesn't do it or at least not all the way and the whole New Testament is people saying we found the key\nWe've we've we've seen the twist ending and we know that God actually has kept all of his promises and how does he teach them how does gone said yes to all his promises in all the Old Testament\nJesus is God's yes if you want to know if God as faithful Jesus shows you that the answer is always yes\nMarshall is a couple of places in the Old Testament where we have something where it's like OK is going to be faithful how's he going to do it because there's two things that seemed like they are at odds\nAnd then I Want to show you how Jesus is God's faithfulness Jesus is gone saying yes to his own words and then when you read the Old Testament on your own\nAnd there's something where God says he'll do it any kind of promise I Want you to gain the skill of saying man got said he do it he's going to do it how did he do it how is Jesus God's yes in this situation in this promise and so I Hope that the Old Testament we will be richer for you because of this\nUm and the first one I Want to talk about is\nSimilar to what I talked about last time about God's presence right are we talked a lot about the temple and how God dwell in the temple but only certain people could go there and yet God had made this promise that he would live which is people that he would do well with his people but\nHow can that happen how can God live with us\nDo you feel that tension God is a spirit he lives in heaven and he cannot be around sinful people so how is he going to live on earth with us who are sinful it it can't happen right do you feel the problem there\nAnd we talked about um I guess this has been two or three weeks ago how Jesus is God's yes to that promise so does God live in heaven as a spirit and that's just inaccessible to us or does he live on earth and keep his promise to to live with us spirit in heaven or body on earth which is it\nYes yes and the gas is\nGod the spiritual eternal being sued wells in heaven and cannot be among singers has become a man and come down to earth and he lives with us and that was like Jesus name is Emanuel God living\nWith us so he's got a spirit up in heaven or is he a human here on earth living with us yes that is guys yes to his problems\nThere was another one that trip should be pretty familiar it's will kind of fundamental to just salvation and that is does God punished sins or does he forgive centers\nWhich is going to be right can't be both in the same person and gone has promised to forgive his people's sense right in the Old Testament God says he'll wipe away our sins how can he do that\nHe I mean he can't he can't just wiped away our sins just say oh well you know it doesn't matter or I'm going to you know sweep it under the cosmic rug\nThere's one in particular where he actually puts the both of these two things together that God is the guys who forgives but also the God who punishes since I'm it's in excess thirty four when he's talking to us about who he is he says I'm the lord and this is what it means that I'm the lord\n... past before Moses and proclaimed his name saying the lord the lord a garden merciful and gracious slow to anger and a bounding and steadfast love and faithfulness\nKeeping steadfast love for thousands for giving iniquity an transgression and sin Mm yes got his gracious and merciful he forgive since that is his promise that his his character listen to the next part\nBut who will by no means clear the guilty but visits the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation got is fair and just that is his character he punish people who do what's wrong because that's the right thing for him to do so what's it going to be\nThe sea forgive you or does he punish her sense\nYes yes\nIn Jesus he actually does punish her since he doesn't just winking and ... and let them pass he actually punished as than in Jesus and by doing that he is able to forgive you of your sins so is that justice or is it forgiveness yes in Jesus another\nOne that is very fundamental to the whole testament story is this idea of Israel having a king right Israel's given a king um it's a good thing in fact David is like the best king and God makes a promise to David especially in second same do seven it's brought up in the songs a lot\nHe promises David one of your sons will always be on the from always\nSo Israel is always going to have the king and it's always going to be somebody who comes from David sign because David Was was such a good king well maybe it was a mixed bag he killed a bunch of people but gun still promise to him because he's ...\nBut the Old Testament ends and there is no king not only is there no king they kind of lost track some of Davis line the temple is gone there is no real like center and Jerusalem everybody's been exiled to Babylon and other parts of the world some people have been allowed to come back\nBut God has made this promise that there will be a king a son of David in Israel and there is no king talked about lacking integrity and and trying to figure out how God how and this is where we get some of those songs where people say God what are you doing here\nGot I'm taking you at your word I'm calling you on what you said you said that David would always have a son who is the king and we don't have a king at all so what are you doing where's your integrity how is this going to line up\nAnd so we face that dilemma with God will always be a son of David on the throne or will God punished Israel because of the bad things that they had and because of the way they followed those back kings\nIs very similar to to mercy injustice will there be a king David or will God punished the nation because of the way they followed their bad kings\nYes yes he will\nAnd the yes is Jesus his death is what allows God's mercy injustice to come together his life his resurrection is what allows got to keep good on his promise that there will be a king forever because Jesus is that king\nJesus is the king over the whole world he traces himself from David\nAnd it's even better actually than what God promised in the Old Testament a lot of promises he like ah he liked turbo chargers them when he actually fulfills them with these as they get to be even better than what people thought they were going to get because it isn't just that each time one of David sons dies there'll be another son who takes his place\nThere'll be one son who lives forever see Jesus is immortal now because he has been raised we can be a hundred percent rock solid sure that there will always be a good king son David on the throne because Jesus having God wants we'll never die again he will always be became\nSo again this dilemma of God's character and integrity\nWill he punished the bad kings or will he give us a good game\nYes\n[noise] um one more than that I Want to talk about um and this was this one that is especially turbo charged in the Old Testament especially to Abraham gone promises a piece of land it's called the promised land quite appropriately\nWill entertain and he promises to Abraham and he says I'm going to give us your descendants and what made Abraham a man of faith is that he believed God even though he never got to that land even though he never saw that he'd have you know thousands of\nOf children he believes that God would do that even when he couldn't see it he believes in God's promises that God was a person of integrity\nBut Israel fails to get into the land right once they get out of Egypt there believe in God yeah we're going to get in this land gotten the person of integrity he's gonna keep its promises and they end up doing circles in the desert for like forty years\nAnd it's it's like God what are you doing\nAre you really going to give us this land that you promise to give us or are we going to have to keep walking around in the desert forever and even after Israel does claim the promised land like I said the way the Old Testament ends only a few people have come back\nIsrael is not a powerful nation that week they have a little bit of their land but not nearly as much as they used to\nAnd so the Old Testament ends with this question we'll God's people really inherit the land that God has given that will he make good on his promise or since we know that he will make good on his promise how exactly is he going to do that does it sure not looking that way to us\nWhen Romans chapter for when when Paul tells the story of Abraham and he's and he talks about his incredible face that he believed God believe that God was somewhat of integrity who keep his promises that's what was counted as righteousness too and he then says\nFor the promise to Abraham that he would inherit the world did not come through the law but rather through the righteousness a face\nSo when Paul looks back on the promise to Abraham he says Abraham wasn't premise just the promised land this little you know this little chunk in the middle east the promise was actually the whole world how does that work\nHow does God giving his people the promised land equal ruling over the whole earth well the answer is yes because Jesus is the king over the whole world right\nJesus can't be just the king of ... and just the king of promised land of the promised land that's way too small for God's people so what does he do he turbo chargers his promise and it wasn't just one little piece of land", "show_name": "First Pres.", "month": "10", "state": "MS", "day": "14", "station": "WBUV", "city": "Moss Point"}
