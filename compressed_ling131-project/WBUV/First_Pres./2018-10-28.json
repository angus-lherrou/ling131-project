asked John who's Blake camera alerted him a burglars trying\nTo beat the Philadelphia Phillies games to two\nAnd I can still remember every possible moment\nYeah I'm a Phillies fan badger high hard radio weekends boards time capsule\nBut what is our structure here and if he's in say\nStarting averse Nineteen he says you who are out are now and you're no longer strangers and aliens\nYour fellow citizens with the saints your members of the household of God built on the foundation of the apostles in profits Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone and you hear all of that as temple language\nThe cornerstone of our temple isn't a huge rock it's Jesus himself and what's the foundation is not an an evenly spread mixture of concrete the foundation of our temple is the teaching of the apostles in the prophet believing in what got upset about himself\nAnd so now there's Twenty one the whole structure is joined together and grow into a holy temple in the lord so where do you find God's presence do you have to go to a building in Jerusalem no\nYou find God's presence whenever a group of people comes together and Jesus is the cornerstone not a building\nAnd the foundation is we look to this book the foundation of your muscles and the profits we believe the scriptures and we have faith in Jesus\nThat is where you find God's presence not in a particular building so what happened to these symbols for the Jews what what went wrong for them with these ideas of the temple and keeping kosher and circumcision because God gave them to them as good things\nWell what happened is they kind of perverted them and turn them into idols and so instead of circumcision being your part of my family and let's extend that other people got became national the God of Jews only\nAnd instead of ... saying you're wholly different in your displaying my character to people got became external\nLike God is pleased with just ... journal things as long as you don't eat these foods you're good as long as you're dressed a certain way you're good so they perverted their symbols to say that got us national that God is racist he wants to use only\nThat God is external you just have to do these rules and then he's happy with you\nAnd finally they got his local that got his pinned down to just one location we kinda have got under some we know exactly where it is where he is and we can visit him anytime and so what gone does is he he blows up all three of these symbols um he says you know what people don't have to be circumcised anymore\nYou know what I'm going to let the Romans ransacked your temple and you're not going to rebuild it and he says you know what those kosher laws we don't do that anymore because that's not how we define ourselves\nCan you imagine someone coming to this country and saying Star Spangled banner we don't do that anymore nobody is allowed to sing that song\nAmerican flag we don't pledge to that any more but that's not our symbol any more can you imagine the the uproar people would not be OK moustache rights and they wouldn't just be making rational arguments that would be saying this person is betraying our country\nThis person must be fought against because they're trying to destroy our liberty our values the documents that we built this entire country around and yet when Jesus comes he takes the three most precious symbols and he says no we don't do that any more\nKosher Peter here's a vision of some animals coming down on a sheet and you can eat whatever you want now temple I tell you what I'm Jesus Says in your lifetime somebody's going to come and totally level this temple and it's not going to be built again that was devastating to the Jews devastating\nNot keeping their laws that was how they knew who they were that's how they knew who was in and who was out and now they don't have to keep kosher [noise]\nAnd what about um they're circumcision you hear a lot about this and the New Testament that people don't have to be circumcised anymore but that's what got sued Abraham that's backing genesis how can you go against the scriptures which say this is how you prove that you're faithful to God is by being circumcised\nWell the big questions\nMoving from the Old Testament to the New Testament in understanding the Bible was can ... be saved the part of God's family as gentile or do they have to become Jews it was a question about symbols\nWhen people come to Jesus and they didn't grow up his shoes there's ... do they have to be circumcised do they have to go to the temple and pay the temple tax and make their uh\nA secret journey you know\nChildren which I think you do they have to make a pilgrimage to the temple and do they have to keep kosher do they have to keep these laws and the church answered a resounding no on all three of those ... received the Holy Spirit\nAs gentile not as those who are circumcised or have loyalty to the temple or who keep kosher so it was a huge huge deal for the early church and Paul writes about it a lot acts is concerned with it a lot\nCan ... get into God's family as ... or does their conversion have to include these symbols these boundary marketers uh Judaism and we talked a little bit about why they were able to say no to all three of those things and the reason was\nAgain not just cultural not it's outdated like oh we've never really liked that stuff anymore so here's a chance to kick it to the curb\nThe reason for all three of those things was Jesus himself because Jesus is what the Bible is about Jesus is what all the symbols that God gave people are really about so Jesus transforms and recon figures all three of those symbols to make them really about himself\nSo let's go back through them and talk about these symbols\nThe similar Jesus is not circumcision is baptism\nThe symbol of Jesus is not only for Jews and I might add only for males the symbol of Jesus entering into his family is baptism and it is available to all regardless of your nationality and regardless of your gender [noise]\nSo the sign of Jesus it's really the same thing as circumcision is the way you get into the cabinet family it's a symbol of God's face a and his his faithfulness and we put our faith in what God has done so in some ways it's it's the same thing as circumcision\nBut it's transformed around Jesus I'm so glad we got to do a baptism today that was so cool was my first one up you can do [noise]\nThis baptism was a powerful symbol because I took a child and I looked at the family and I said God is a ... is a God not just to you but to your whole family\nAnd it's not just circumcision which was of the Old Testament but we took a little girl and we sprinkled her the same way we are sprinkled with the blood of Christ and on the last one on the holy ghost I tried to get as much as I could and poured it on her because also symbolizes pouring out the Holy Spirit man what a powerful symbol\nAnd it's it's different than circumcision but it's really circumcision fulfilled its foot circumcision was always meant to be open to everyone in a signal of the fact that we actually have been saved by Jesus not just the promise that God was giving out that he would save us one day [noise]\nWell what about keeping kosher we don't keep kosher anymore we don't really do that stuff\nAnymore and why because when Jesus came he said it's not about the external things you do it's about the internal way that your heart is gone says I've never really been that concerned about your burnt offerings and things like that we read that assault fifty one you know why because those were just extra things you could do whether you love me or not\nSo what is the mark of a Christian what what symbol to wield to say we are in we are part of the family if it's not kosher laws like what we wear or what we eat I'll tell you what it is we are known by our deeds of love\nThat is the symbol of Jesus how do you know that somebody belongs to him because they've been baptized into the family and they live like our savior they live out the seeds of love and Jesus Says that himself doesn't he\nDoesn't he said this is how they're going to know you by the fact that none of my people eat pork by the fact that none of my people wear polyester no they will know you because you love each other [noise] if you love each other from the heart that is something that only the Holy Spirit can do\nAnd so when people look at this community and they say that water thing was kind of a kind of weird symbol that everybody has to do that before they get in you can say yeah everybody has to do that before they get it and here's why here's what it means but perhaps even more powerfully you can love people [noise]\nYou can love each other and it's a lot harder than just eating some things are not eating other things but it's also a lot more powerful because Jesus has taken the symbols of our faith\nAnd rearrange them around himself [noise]\nWell what about the temple I'm gone does not confined to just one location right if you don't have to fly to one place in the world\nIn order to be near a God how can you find God how can you find his presence how can you know where he lives where he he lives in us through the Holy Spirit so we can say both individually and collectively the temple of God now is a group of people who believe in Jesus and who do acts of love right\nIf somebody wants to meet God we don't give them directions to a particular building right come to frustrate but here in church doesn't matter who they are just lives in this building no because gone covers the whole world right\nWhat we say is I tell you what once you come over to our house well why don't you come on Sunday Morning when we hear God's word and we sing songs of praises and we remember who we are and maybe you'll find God's presence there not in a single physical location but where his people are\nAnd why why do we do that why do we change from a building to a group of people because of Jesus [laughter]\nBecause the symbol was really always about Jesus the question where does God live where can you find him was answered that guy that guy right there Jesus of Nazareth you swear to God listens and then Jesus and gives us that gift to us by pouring out the Holy Spirit and so now somebody asked me and where's the hard work and I find him", "show_name": "First Pres.", "month": "10", "state": "MS", "day": "28", "station": "WBUV", "city": "Moss Point"}
