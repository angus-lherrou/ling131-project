I'm a center is asked it before you this morning and said I'm Phillip I'm a center as I pointed out at all if you are reminded you that you're centers where am I on the descriptor tells us the wages of\nSin is that we all deserve to die because of our sense\nBut there are times when our sins so blatant so obvious that we really understand that and then everyone knows that that's what Jonah deserved but God was not going to let\nYou wanted to not amazing job of trying to take his life and God says no\nWho's in charge gods in charge going back to that ... passage so pointed to a man to die once and after\nThis comes judgment right appointed who appoints that God can we sort short circuit that absolutely not\nJonah or God wasn't just determined to save Jonah from the consequences of his and he was actually determine to save Jonah from his\nPart of the backstory of Jonah it's not just who's in charge\nBut it's the story of what God is doing and Joan and he's moving him from disobedience to obedience he's moving him from rebellion to submission he's doing what he does and all of us this glorious work of sank to vacation that begins from the moment we embrace the true God until the moment we die\nHe's saving him not just from the consequences of this sin he's determined to save him from his sent next group is determined to save his the people of none of them [laughter] let me remind you of where we come from\nChapter one verse to comes to Jonah inverse too says arise ... that great city and call out against it Jonah says no Jonah runs away\n... since the storm God has Jonah tossed into the sea got appoints the fish to swallow Jonah now fast forward a few days when the when the fish regurgitate Jonah onto the shore and then God comes to Jonah again chapter three verse to\nReverse won the war to the lord came to Joan of the second time saying arise go to none of that great city and call out against it\nOr why was God determined to save none of us well just like Jonah he was determined to save them from the consequences of their sin from the calming destruction he called Jonah and said going warned them of my judgment this coming\nUpon them now Jonah for ... that call but God never for ... book his compassion towards enough\nHe was always determined to send a profit to none of us a call out to them and more specifically he was always determined to send Jonah to none of them to call out against them so runners he might\nHe cannot run God as much as he might want to die and avoid this call he can't avoid God's calling on his life why because God had the ... lights in view\nNot just the consequences of their sin but also like Jonah used the term to save them from their said he's aiming for their repentance for their salvation and that's exactly what you see when you\nGo further into the book of Jonah the lights repair it I think one of the glories in heaven is that one day we're going to meet some of these ... ... repented at the preaching of Jonah because God was determined to save them\nThird group from the text that we see God determined to say\nIt's the sailors we think they just kind of accidentally showed up in the story you think maybe a sovereign God even took in Jonas rebellion even appointed the exact ship that he was going to be on the exact sailors that we're going to be on that ship was trying to save those sailors from first of all the consequences of their sin\nThese men live with foolish fear their whole life\nThey're afraid of the the wind in the sea and ... and and not a\nI'm not talking about a a an unhealthy fear of that uh you know when you have a storm like Michael bearing down upon you and everyone tells you to flee the coast\nIt's not trusting God\nTo remain on the coast is it right we understand that God's since those things and we recognize that and we run from it but what they were fearing was not that God had brought these things that were actually afraid of wind of of waves\nAnd it was a false God that they attributed it to he was removing this this fear of scenes this fear of false God and translating it to a godly fear ultimately he wanted to save them not just from the\nConsequences but actually from their sin itself\nIt's data fearing the wind and waves to fear the God of the wind in ways instead of fear and fall Scott's to fear the truth and living God a fear that actually leads to worship and then the beautiful when you get to to uh to VR sixteen\nThis little word then\nThen they feared the lord exceedingly and they offered a sacrifice to the lord and made the house\nThey already recognized that it was the God of Jonah that sent this they already recognized that they couldn't do anything to apiece him they already recognized that they were bound by the circumstances that he brought in all they could do was simply throw Jonah overboard\nBut notice when they began to fear exceedingly in wasn't in the midst of the storm it was in the midst of the calm for them they knew that this was the true in living God and this guy has spared them and I love the picture here they began to worship\nThey offer to sacrifice they made vowels and again I'm convinced that didn't happen we'll meet some of these sailors who were converted because God sent storm and a profit of rebellious profit\nWho mentions the name of the true God and they began to be exposed to him and began to worship him [noise]\nGod was determined to save the term to say Jonah determined to save the ... determined to save\nThe sailors you can make that argument all throughout the tax but I'm Will tell you another group that you're not going to see in this text which you're going to see it all over the scriptures and that's this\nGod's also determined to save you and they\nGot us determined to save you and me from what from our sense\nOne of the things about the book of Jonah is a lot of people talk about and it's clear here the Jonah is a type of Christ",
