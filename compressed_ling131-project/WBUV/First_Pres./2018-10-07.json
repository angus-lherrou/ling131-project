predictability that they provide really save us from the nastiness that we've seen on display the last few weeks well I'm somewhat skeptical\nWhen the stakes really be that much lower if Kavanaugh were in the wrong for an Eighteen year term on the court with with everything else being equal in other words if the current conservative liberal split and the potential fate of the abortion law were hanging in the outcome the promise that Kavanaugh would merely sit on the bench for Eighteen years we're probably not bring Democrats down from the barricades\nAnd nor would it make Republicans any less likely to push for his confirmation but even if you're just will term limits are actually a bulwark against the hyper partisan environment that's increasingly spilling over into the Supreme Court the idea might be worth considering for two other reasons\nFor one people seem to like a recent morning console political poll found that sixty one percent of voters favored term limits for Supreme Court justices including majorities of Democrats Republicans and independents\nAnd for a second reason it would openly acknowledge something that everyone already knows\nThat control the Supreme Court is a reward for electoral success now this goes against what the founders may have intended they wanted lifetime Supreme Court appointments to buffer the justices from political interests but it's clear now\nIf it wasn't already that both sides Democrats and Republicans view Supreme Court appointments as the spoils that come from controlling the president's the in the Senate\nSo if the high court is going to be politicized anyway maybe it makes sense to have those seats the democratically accountable and\nActually reflect the results of elections over the previous two decades which is what the Eighteen year term limits system\nWould accomplish now imposing term limits would require a constitutional amendment that's probably an impossibly heavy lifting the current environment and there's plenty of other stumbling blocks to in all likelihood nothing is going to change will continue to muddle through with the same\nSomewhat broken process that we're using now term limits or the lack of will not fixed the underlying problems plaguing all aspects\nOf the capital confirmation process for reason magazine I'm Eric bam cut you right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe next time a nominee to the Supreme Court is presented to members of the Senate the Senate needs to act in a more civil fashion so says calling Hannah of let freedom ring usa on this American radio journal commentary\nPresident Trump's domination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court was bound to be ideologically controversial because it would create a generally conservative five to four majority for what I Would argue is the first time since FDR it's not before\nI expected that the primary ideological issue with the abortion and whether he would tilt the balance of the court away from the constitutionally liberal articulation of a right to privacy that permits most abortions too are constitutionally conservative interpretation\nThat the documents simply cannot be stretched to the point of either permitting were prohibited abortions\nI expected some charges a massage and they and ingrained prejudice against women and I thought that the makeup of the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee eleven white males many of whom are rather shall we say senior would be used as a case in point by the other side\nBut I never thought that the process would descend the level of embarrassing spectacle that it did no matter the outcome the Senate and by extension our entire Republican form of government has been ... by the emotionally charged\nThe accusations of sexual misconduct and they were responsible drinking and the equally emotionally charged defenses of judge Kavanaugh the self righteous posturing and ... on both sides of the aisle and the casual discussion of improprieties has made CSPAN X. rated\nThe Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body will it certainly was not that over the past couple of weeks it was more like a locker room or a late night bar venting session the me too movement has properly awake and many Americans to the plight of victims of sexual misconduct especially rape and attempted rape\nIt is completely understandable that victims were repressed their memories of such incidents and be fearful of disclosing details\nHowever that new willingness to give the benefit of doubt to victims cannot extend to the point of ignoring relative facts and testimonies there are many cases of false accusations even if they constitute the minority of all accusations of sexual misconduct\nFor instance there are too many African American men convicted and jailed after having been accused of rape or attempted rape of white women where in fact\nThe accusation was ill founded one of the most well known of these is the case of high school football star Brian Banks was falsely accused convicted and serving time in prison with his accuser finally admitted to fabricating the entire claim\nWe will probably never know what really happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey or at Yale a few years later\nBut we are looking at the judicial record of a lawyer and judge who's conduct has never wants to my knowledge been subject to question or a scandal in the many years that he is practice law or served on the bench\nYet his adolescent conduct may have been reprehensible and should not be dismissed lightly but it's not the student Brett\nKavanaugh of over a quarter century ago who was nominated if the judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC circuit court\nThe wants in this regard as his judicial record by those who oppose him on ideological grounds but don't have the courage or intellect to challenge him on his record shows the world that we base our ideals by our bum best I voted for President Trump and I support his nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nBut I cringe when I hear him mock doctor for it I think judge Kavanaugh has what it takes to be a good justice of our Supreme Court but I cringe when he allows himself to make snide remarks to a senator who is the daughter of an alcoholic or when he descends into partisan comments about his accusers\nDo you ... of American radio journal feel the same way do you feel the need for a shower after watching some of our senators\nAre you tired of political arguments that have little to do with the subject being discussed and are really all about acquiring are holding onto a political power\nAfter the dust settles on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote joined me in writing to your two senators to elevate their advice and consent role to something more reflective of a great democracy and less reflective of spoiled
