I just don't know I\nI think ... actually I'll I'll put it this way I don't think any insurance company or take money of somebody eighty five or older what I find difficulty in as they have difficulty watched you reach age eighty that pretty much does it except for\nSome short term CD annuities it's not uncommon for people above Seventy to utilize them because once again it's correlated to their overall\nAssets and no matter what age you put your money and there's a surrender period so that has to be correlated to your other assets and what your\nLiquidity is it's often we have somebody come in that Seventy or older and wall no risk\nSo where do you go to yield\nAnd have it be risk averse helped me James whereas just in the ... well yeah it is that in ... that you gave me got me there is because you don't know they're they're it's bike CDs or there was Wall Street know yelled at the banks and risk Wall Street so\nThen the other question is why would somebody a seven day put their money at risk it should be drastically reduced what they put at risk at that point you know would you put it eight Seventy would you put a hundred percent of the grass at Wall Street\nI think that's insane ... right yeah so it has to be dial back that does it means to have people coming in wanting risk but\nYou know what we're going to look out for them on that and say hey you you might need half of your assets and ballot spin ... portfolio that but the thing is regardless of age I think there should be some sort of ballots risk versus no risk there and it's just a conversation that you have this person was\nPurely a con artist 'cause I don't know of any company that would take money at age nine any well I'm sure she told them some story because she is having them write the checks to her oh yeah Ninety year olds perfect for that but there wasn't no insurance company who's gonna take it\nWhatsoever it was that crook there's a reason for\nUs surrender period and you might think of it as\nSomething wrong I mean that there's a surrender period the reason there's a surrender period has the money needs time to work because they're taking the money and putting it in treasuries and high quality corporate bonds\nSo if you're putting it in that it needs some time you know what are you getting on a ten year treasury now if the insurance company wants to take longer to get yelled fine\nBut they're typically given somebody somewhere in the neighborhood of uh ten years surrender period\nThat's what makes it work\nAs a product is having a period of leaving the money what company so the company can make money\nAnd pass along the guarantees\nTo you and a lot of companies don't want to die for Seventy five\nAnd some don't want to die for Seventy so it starts reducing the field of how many companies want to be in that business now\nAre they changing a little bit because of longevity\nYes but they don't have a comfort level that they all have the money long enough that it's viable for them as well as the client and that's what you're looking at on a surrender period as somebody comes in her Seventy five is like are you know we're not doing health history or anything and he's not having to qualify health wise\nLike life insurance but statistically it's a actuarial basis is how long is this guy going to live and this is going to be profitable for us we don't want to do start this deal in him die in a couple of years they'll lose money in that case\nNo thank you very much for hanging out with us today uh we do the six days a week if\nYou don't get to catch all of our

nine nine five they really appreciate Brian current joined us there in that second segment I Want to get into got a really uh uh we get questions all the\nTime and emails and and the one this week as most of the you know I Do reverse mortgages and and this really just\nClarify for me number one why I Do what I Do as far as meeting with people before I send them to go get counseling because it it was disturbing in in a lot of times the emails that I Do get\nA or basically from people who have been misled or pointed down the wrong road or just given horrible information so ... in a nutshell this email here\nUm my mother age sixty five and my dad step at age sixty eight have a home in Long Beach that my mother had paid off\nMy step dad and reverse mortgage company talk to her into signing the home over to him\nAnd told my mom she could find her property she can she can sign her property over him and they could add her when she turned sixty three Okay Number one that that's disturbing their cause legal age of sixty two\nShe now sixty five and it found out that for two years ah she's been being told that they were going to add her but have not added her and now that an out the taxes are passed to enter and step dad is in poor health\nSo and now they're in a situation where with dad being in poor health here's where this kind of so now dad's in poor health and on top of that they now have to adopt\nTheir nephews that are Thirteen and Fifteen Years old so\nHere's a little bit of what happened here okay in in this is where the education piece and that knowledge and sitting down with someone who is looking out for you and not their bottom line okay\nSo after I talk to I called the daughter and she isn't just disarray because now mom is potentially going to lose their home and I'm actually helping them to try to get this figured out\nAt the time when mom had house paid off got remarried dad was a legal reverse mortgage age but mom wasn't\nSo they talked mom into signing house over to dad so they can do to reverse mortgage but here's where they went wrong they totally took her off of the reverse mortgage\nOkay this is wide number one if you come to me and I told somebody this week I Would not help them because one person was sixty three and the other one was fifty eight\nNo kudos to my boys who sixty three and he married to fifty eight year old how about your boy he's doing good so good for him but what I was not going to do is I was not going to do a reverse mortgage where somebody else is not a qualifying age\nAnd this is one of the reasons why because now this poor lady okay step dad or or new husband regardless of what my real thoughts of him are\nOkay kinda scammed mom out of this money by becoming on the house okay now I don't think that was his intentions and we know is intentions wanting to become deathly ill but now on fortunately\nMom is in a situation\nThat she cannot rightfully buyout that mortgage or take over the note on the mortgage\nWhereas if she would have been put on the mortgage as a non borrowing spouse and this again is why people have to work with somebody that knows what's going on and you can't just go to magnum PI or the fonts\nAnd talk to somebody out of a foreign country that's going to say you need to do this call this number and then when you've done that call me back\nThat it's not what you should be doing\nOkay because if she would have been put on even in that horrible situation as a non borrowing spouse\nAt least shoot if she would have Ninety Days\nTo prove that she can legally be part is part of the home or that she could afford to pay the taxes and insurance is and remain in the home", "year": "2018", "show_name": "CROSS COUNTRY MORTGAGE - MORTGAGE GUMBO", "city": "Moss
