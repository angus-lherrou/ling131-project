{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "I see are there any charities that you like\nWell yeah I I can I can uh [noise] they got a list of a a friend and carry leave things to that that that's not the problem the problem is not normally you ah have a close relative who animals all the details when you on [laughter]\nYeah so being you don't have that this might be going into the area of like life insurance goes by beneficiary designation but life insurance can pay into a trust as well as some of your money in like our razor retirement plans\n\nIf some of your money in retirement plans like an hour I\nNo no no no no no a qualified money when they\nOkay that makes it easier so one of those things might be of interest is to set up a trust doesn't necessarily have to be the your vocal kind but\nCan be the trust that basically leaves the instructions behind them how you won't everything's settled and then somebody would be a trustee that would do that but the the would\nFollow the direction\nOf that trust of how to handle the house the bank account and so forth\nWe kind of justice that called\nA well there's two basic types that it's used for succession so to speak a beat a living trust which is a real vocal trust means you can change your mind on it you\nCould even do it here of vocal trust is one that when you name the beneficiaries and how you want it to go you're probably not going to do that in that case but either way\nYou're setting instructions of how this is to go even if you want so much of it paid out a year\nCould be done that way as well but you would probably need to use somebody like an estate planning attorney to do so when we have the total wealth authority west Blanchard that you could use a Tom you could call the office and we could connect you with White House\nAnd get you some more help on taking care of these concerns that sound good Tom\n\nHandling feeling you expenses I have a life life insurance policies or to pay for it today I Am no beneficiary who can walk walk in and the policies to a funeral home yeah\nTrust can take care of that so you need to call my office I'll give you my uh daytime number from daytime job when natural advisor CEO of the farm\nOr the phone number for daytime is by boat for three to Ninety two hundred the websites Gregory rex dot com but called the office and will connect you with ... west Blanchard and get these details of is do you need somebody to\nHelp sign all this he's going to help you organize so that does help and when they come a long time down the road thanks for the call top thank you very much yeah and I'm surprised\nThat there's so many people in this scenario but we get calls them quite often and I love hearing about the people that have either adopted a charity like in an organization but we've also seen people basically just adopted non family member and I'm going to leave all my money to this guy or this gal says I Know they're a good person and I just want to help\nUm you know in our\nWe don't always know how tech savvy people are but you know you've got these genealogy genealogy any allergy websites and where you can kind of go in and put together the family that spreads out he's\nDoesn't have many any close connections but they're obviously connections farther out\nAnd probably some research there might help him on that or anybody else that's thinking about that could there because you know even in the family tree there's good people there\nThat will help looked out or could be instructions or might need the help\nAs well and I think there's been a number of great charities you know I support many charities throughout the year that we rotate I Know it it I said this next thing I Know I'll I'll get\nCalls next week wanting us to do other charities and all week we've kind of built that out and we might make some adjustments but we pretty much stick to what we feel good about those five uh one sees and and the work that they do and make sure the money goes locally\nAnd that the monies put to work so if I was leaving in the state behind us the things I Would look at is how do I help the community and some of it could be education help some of those people in a certain filled that you might sport may be able to borrow money either\nTo go to college there that some some neat things you can do\nWell I liked the idea of turning the your legacy money into an actual legacy now I have kids of my money is going to go to them and their grandkids or whatever but you know the college is number one businesses education but their second biggest revenue driver is the memorial business they bring in tons of money just so we could put Tom and met hurry\nDormitory hall or whatever it is that the naming rights either a gym or new theater or a dorm or you know you make these donations and maybe it's just an aquarium or something smaller like that\nBut sometimes if you don't have somewhere where your money supposed to go I Would look at the legacy business that looks like a really cool option for those that don't have direct airs the memorial business\nYeah and it doesn't have to be universities that could be high school playground or a part of the areas that ... that\nImpacts you and it doesn't necessarily have to be local school somebody else's community is local for them so there are some pretty cool things you can do or even in parts or music\nA lot of areas and ... for Tom just eat he's looking for help to start exploring that but he's more you know it kind of in like you know heck who who would pay the funeral and stuff\nYou know and and that's an interesting point because that's something we do help people with as a funeral trust also\nTo where Fonz can be made available\nNext day to take care of those things because technically when the trust is set up the money is directed for that and it can be tied with life insurance as well to make sure funds were immediately available to take care of those needs and\nThose that are involved in that trust are making sure those things were happening and the price and everything be unfair\nAs well so there's a way to get some of the stunt\nYeah infant part Tom story sounds oh let's say they have any family or whether what but what he does have is a pretty cool opportunity to do something the rest of us don't get to do and set up some sort of memorial approach to their stomach day jobs\nWell ... yeah we're about there but we were talking about the thirteenth check earlier in the show oh in the ... coming in is look yeah people are up in arms and I can understand if you're a teacher and ... because of where this is going\nBut that is a financial burden the math does that work long range and that's why this is coming up it's a question about the funding so this we're gonna talk about this more in the future\nAnd bring you the news that we pick up on that my day job financial advisor money manager ... ...\n... guide up the path maybe you're sharp a help fine where are you on the path and how does your final destination look ... what does it look like are you going to arrive where you want to\nThat's pretty cool get to where you

urge radio station\n[noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts time ... year old a deadly mass shooting at Pittsburgh's tree of life synagogue hissing is very bad inside so there are multiple fatalities\nThere at least six centuries to include for police officers [noise] the police officers injuries at this time or non life threatening the other individuals are critical and serious in nature\nUsed that now they're using twenty sixteens data that's compared to sixty one percent Nineteen Seventy one okay now between Nineteen Seventy one or two thousand a lab in the share of adults in middle class fell by ten percent\nOkay\nSince the middle class has remained relatively stable\nSo that's all fine and dandy hey great Dwayne can you tell me\nWhat's the numbers are middle class so here you go into household income is two thirds to double the national media which is fifty seven thousand dollars this as a twenty sixteen so by that definition this is what Peter was defined it\nIt's middle class if your household income is two thirds to double the national median of fifty seven six fifty seven thousand six hundred so that means a middle income three person household that earns about forty five to ... thirty five thousand\nIf you're single it's a salary of around twenty six thousand to Seventy eight thousand qualifies you for middle class\nSo what do you think how do you fall I mean that seems like a pretty big number right twenty six thousand to Seventy eight thousand if you're a single person male or female you or considered middle income middle class\nIf you're a three person household forty five to thirty five thousand dollars\nOkay\nMiddle income for a two person how so it's thirty six thousand on up so let's look at the bottom arrange right 'cause they they give it a big old average year upper ... upper income they're considering for one person is Seventy eight thousand\nTwenty six thousand middle for a family uh to heart and ten thousand is upper\n\nMiddle is thirty six nine\nOkay\nThree people family we just talked about that middle was forty five offers one thirty five\nFamily of four\nHundred and fifty six thousand his upper fifty two thousands middle and a family of five fifty eight thousands middle ... Seventy five thousand is upper\nSo where do you follow those numbers hey or middle or upper middle what exactly is your number\nI just thought this was pretty interesting because when you when you put down incomes on paper it looks a little bit different right that which is south thoughts in perceptions are\nBut you know what I when I take applications at my folks take applications it can range I mean you've got some teachers that are making\nThirty five thousand you've got other teachers that are making a eighty five thousand dollars so you know depending on how long how long you been doing different things so I guess my question is is\nYou know is middle income really is it based on\nAge wise like should that should that have anything to do with it because hey maybe this five person family that's at a hundred and Seventy five thousand bucks\nYou know if they're if they're a little bit of an older family or they may be a head of the person that's sitting at five with middle income at fifty eight thousand I probably venture to say maybe they are in a little bit better shape\nBut I thought these interests are these numbers were pretty interesting to think that sixty almost Seventy percent sixty eight percent to be exact according to this people think that they are middle class or middle income okay so that's just kind of some some neat stuff in my opinion there I mean I\nYou know based sock tell you this based on the restaurants based on seeing everybody out everybody spends money like their upper class which is why we're going to talk about credit which is why ... and I bring this up is why we're in a lot of the situation that we're in when we're starting\nTo look at the home buying more ... to look at student loan debt when we're starting to look at all these other things that that are attributing factors to what the future holds for us\nThese are the things that income where we add how are we spending everybody's going to have to really really really\nRethink budgets really have to rethink everything and folks that's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing but it's just understanding that those are the things that we're going to have to do making sure when we move forward\nBecause as we've discussed that has been free for the longest time and it's not free anymore\nIt's not free anymore\nSo we get back from the break we've got a busy show we've\nGot a ... plant a lot of stuff about credit I Want to make sure you're aware of what a hall hard and soft credit inquiry is you can also talk about hey where's purchasing power going\nYou consider buying a home where's that going in of course we're also going to discuss a great watch as well you're listening a mortgage gumbo which Wainstein right here on TALK radio five oh four to six zero zero now not five if you want to join a show [noise]\nGot an apple we've all that but you really know if you had the proper coverage is at the most competitive cost it until I called team be with a free policy review and they were able to advise me on policies that meant money not my carry on the weather it's home auto all commercial let them do the same for you\nCall today Ninety five six one to Eighteen thirty to obey the teen B.
