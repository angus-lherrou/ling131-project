Wal Mart is now it was this giant stores like a general store they have they had everything you could go there and you get some blue jeans you could go get your family portrait taken it the portrait studio you could they had a little corner of the the store that was all state\nRep you could go get your insurance taken care of then you could go get your tires change maybe a new diehard battery if you want to get a dishwasher over here maybe some forks on the second floor\nIt had everything it was it was like Wal Mart\nBut there was a young spry upstart that was cutting into their business in the main way they were doing it was just doing it cheaper offering everything under the sun but just a little bit cheaper than Sears doing it back then it was called Kmart\nSee now it's Walmart and they're fighting against Amazon\nBut it was almost an exact same dynamic that you have the Wal Mart versus Amazon today was Sears versus K mart in Nineteen Seventy nine and so that makes for some interesting audio gold when you go to Phil Donahue program and that will talk show\nHe had Milton Friedman on in Nineteen Seventy nine in the big discussion of the day was\nWhat are we going to do about k-mart what are we going to do about Syria you know Sears was this monopoly but a Kmart is coming up and you know maybe both of these companies are too big and we need to break them up and you know they keep throwing around this term monopoly like companies like monopolies even exist for any length of time without falling apart\nBut because they filed for bankruptcy on Monday is a great time to go check out how the discussion from Sears was going about what's almost forty years ago this is thirty nine years ago from the Phil Donahue programs\nYou can can serious by k-mart to and you're in you're of course you'd think so\nSears has been one of the great protectors of the consumer all over all during its existence in a matter of fact you say considered by k-mart the white Kmart has been growing the question is going to be can Kmart vice [laughter]\nAll right but that's\nAn example not take that into words you you really didn't want the Justice Department out of this too huh I mean you don't have any problem at all with with\nUs kind of fact in anti trust measure you can take in this country would be complete free trade\nAnd the Big East will eat up the ... little ones that is not we've already has the demise of many that has never happened there have been very careful studies May of what has happened to the concentration of industry in this country over the past hundred years\nAnd accept in those areas where government has stepped in it is not true that the Big East of eating up the smallest in fact it's often than the other one and Kmart is a good example is started from nothing Sears was running a major conglomerates Sears has been losing losing ground and going downhill in St Martin in rising\nAnd now both companies are a part of the same outfit and they're both going under together oh is it that's so sweet I mean if we'd only known\nForty years ago how the story what ended up we would've lasted all those people to say that the case was being made in Nineteen Seventy nine hey we need to break up so you know we don't need to break up the years go on any of the\nThese giant companies that seemed like these mammoth ... but he is at the time or you are being clouded by your what's it called contemporary biased where you think whatever's happening today will just keep happening in the future at in tonight I'm\nWell look if\nIf you're worried about a company today that's too big and you want to see it broken up you don't have to have the government intervened all you have to do is wait about Thirty years and the chances are they will of falling apart by then\nThe you know the average lifespan of a fortune five hundred company I'm not talking about the little restaurant that just open and close in six months on the corner I'm Talking about the five hundred biggest companies I eat most stable biggest revenue all that good stuff to five hundred biggest companies\nTheir ... their average lifespan is less than Thirty years there is no such thing as a gigantic monopoly untouchable that's doing the wrong thing\nWithout government intervention look at G. E. G. E. circling the drain just like Sears is genes on the cusp of heck that they screw around too much they're going to get the listed I mean they still have a ways to go before that but that's\nWhere they're headed yeah so all these people worried about oh you monopolies or we need to break up who was that that need to be broke up\nI think it was a who's I think ... if someone was saying that they would like to see a Google broke up because they control too much and they have monopoly and no one company should have that much power hey you want to see Google broken up just wait about Thirty years they ... they probably won't even be around there'll be replaced by something else\nYou don't believe me go after blockbuster do estimate gum rewards go as the years go after you get to go ask all these other places that have gone out of business are these giant wars\nSo fidelity investments\nI think ah if they're not the biggest custodian of investments they're one of them they they hold seven point two trillion dollars inclined assets are they made a huge announcement earlier this week they are announcing a new and separate company called fidelity digital assets services\nAnd the firm will this from this new little branch will handle crypto currency [noise]\nThat's interesting now does that mean that Fidel that he thinks that bitcoin and crypto currencies are the wave of the future\nNot really it just means that they found out a way to make money off of it at least for now and so they're going to go ahead and do that so this is not an endorsement of crypto currency is but we get a lot of emails and calls and Facebook messages on the topic\nSo we'll keep you updated on it but\nFidelity is the first Wall Street incumbent mean they're actually on actual Wall Street to officially provide crypto currency solutions including custody so\nFidelity investments is jumping all over this this could be is the steps that the crypto needs to become more stable more widely accepted and actually be used what its\nPurported to be used for and that is a currency a store a value so you can buy and sell and\nYou know I'm not have to use the barter system or not have your currency inflated while sitting there being held or change values well it's changing values so it's not quite serving the purpose you would hope for in a currency now it's just some sort of weird collectible beanie baby type investment\nBut I got my eye on it because if it ever does stabilize that there's going to be some cool little side effects unintended side effects that are going to change the financial world in earnest\nA bad news the twenty Eighteen federal deficit you know the fiscal year just in it at the beginning of October the federal deficit for last year was the largest it's twenty twelve absolutely an unacceptable seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that [noise]\nSo this is the ... the fifth I guess that doesn't make it the fifth worst deficit in American history which means that this president is on track to be the second worst spinning president in history the worst was before him or the third worst would be before him\nSo the three worst physically speaking presidents that we've had in American history our last three presidents and no one seems to care I don't see Republicans or Democrats falling all over themselves to balance the budget and if you\nKnow anything about me you've been listening to show for the ... for a while that's all I care about at this point I don't care what the rest of the\nEither one of the parties is talking about is anyone going to balance its budget 'cause this is going to destroy us all this is what happened to Venezuela didn't balance our budget they printed more than ... than they can handle this is what happens Soviet Union is what happened the Roman empire this is how countries\nFall so until someone starts paying attention to that I don't have a political party\nSilly deficits ruined it for me or your home away from the show the winning it life at and winning it life dot com thank you very much for hanging out with this for a party of Saturday\nAnd are being better with your money you can go check out all of our episodes all of our podcasts are available for free on demand or you can live [noise] download the winning life apps and you're absolutely right now don't cost nothing [noise]\nSo hey good luck the football team today [noise] I Hope ah olive you get a when I Know all of you aren't gonna cause somebody you're cheering for opposite teams today aren't you [noise] time [noise]\nI barter this says wanting it live with Gregory wreck [noise]\nFrom\nThem and do you see in the studios [noise] this is talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station\nThey say he was killed in a fight so I'm ...

like that hey it's just a great weekly a newsletter that we put out that keeps you updated on everything that's going on so make sure you check that out\nGot a question this week and ... and we'll jump into this uh for\nUp against the break here this is from Alicia Alicia from Pascagoula give her a little shout out here at least show wanted to know I Am currently wanting to buy a home we've been looking at for a while so this is a house that she's been looking at\nI was told today after looking at it again with the realtor that someone has already made an offer but nothing has been signed jet\nAm I still able to buy this house is my real to saying or is my real are saying this just to get me to rush into the purchasing process All right\nSo a couple of things here Elise show if you're questioning your realtor and not trusting if she's trying to force you into the process you've got the wrong realtor that's number one okay that's number one however\nPersonally I think the it's the realtors job to let you know\nThat there is some offers that have been made\nBut yes you are still OK to make an offer on a property even though someone else has made that offer okay which is why this question is what triggered me it's a kind of starting to realize you know what let's talk about ... but absolutely yes you can\nYou can still make an offer now\nBe prepared or understand that if that initial offer at us ahead of you is a better off or something like that chances are you're still not going to get that property\nBut it is your age your job to sort of let you know that when I offer is being made my only question to you at least you would be\nHey what kept you from making I offer before\nOkay was it a new one pretty qualified you wasn't sure how much if you could afford a home or maybe you were waiting on something else so there's a lot of different factors which is why folks again you want to make sure that you're getting pre approved you want and I tell stories all the time\nOn the show and and I love it but the reason you want to make sure that you're getting pre approved this because when this house or you don't have to sit here and wonder should I made an offer because chances are with keeps most people on the sideline is they are more worried or they're embarrassed to find out\nIs the answer no and I understand that\nListen when you're looking at purchasing a home hey we got pulled the covers back it's sometimes people get a little bit scared about what's going on under those covers right they like to take the head shots only they don't like to take the whole full body part well we've got to do that when we're purchasing a home\nBut that's why we want to look at you pre approved at least you're so would I Would say in that process says listen I don't think you really just trying to rush into anything ah I think you realtors probably it's their job to let you know simply that hey somebody is making an offer on the home or has already made an offer and if something's not signed yet\nThat means they probably have a pretty good relationship maybe with that realtor that selling the home so she's trying to give you a heads up which I think is a good thing so um but again to circle back\nYou've got to make sure that you are using an agent that you fully trust folks that you fully trust and that's why so many people come to me before they even start the process\nThree clients this week alone I set out to agents that I'm working with okay because you know why because they trust me we got um pre approved and now that they're pre approved I sent them up with an agent that works in their particular markets so you don't don't go to the agent first\nCall the lender and get yourself pre approved not pre qualified we've been through that a million times hey when we come back from the break\nWe're going to talk about how much money do\nYou have in your savings accounts [noise] prepare to be disappointed runoff drive off
