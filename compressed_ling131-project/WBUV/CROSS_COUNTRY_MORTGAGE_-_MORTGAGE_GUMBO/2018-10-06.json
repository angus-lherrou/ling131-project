[noise]\n[noise] from the Mandel viewing GMC studios [noise] this is talk on overnight somebody points and I urge radio station\nGetting ready for the big vote I'm Roger eastern Fox News ... hours away from what everyone expects to be the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next justice on the Supreme Court boxes Jared helping his live on Capitol Hill with the latest\nHe would have to be Ninety seven years old\nSo my whole point is let's pay off that mortgage start putting at six hundred dollars a month\nSix hundred times twelve is what Seventy two hundred a year right so I mean let's just take if there is no interest on that I mean he's looking at over ten years alone just to get that mortgage taking care of\nWhich as I said he had Twenty years left so folks would I Want you to understand with a reverse mortgage is this\nOkay you have options\nNobody's coming to me with the to get a reverse mortgage because they want to buy a four wheeler or because they want to um go on vacation they're coming to me because they want to dial back\nThey want to start appreciating their significant other they want to make sure that their significant other is going to have a roof over their head\nAnd my point of talking about these folks as you won't meet with me personally\nTo go over what your options are so not only are we going to pay off this mortgage we're going to give him a couple of grand because he's going to do a couple of improvements he wants to add a shed a ... in the back a little workshop he likes to do some work\nSo he's going to add a workshop at a back and we're going to provide all bat\nFor him so here's option was a fixed rate reverse okay\nAnd we know from the show there's different concepts and ones where you build a lot of credit but here's option by paying off the mortgage with the equity half is a fixed rate reverse\nMy whole point of telling you is is there if you were talking to a no other company out there and they're telling you the first thing you need to do is go get counseling you're being misled and unjustly treated in my opinion\nYour home is your most valuable asset no matter what age you are but especially when it comes to a reverse mortgage I take it serious that this is the place that you are probably going to close your eyes for the last time\nAnd I want to be able to look you in your eyes it shake your hand and hug you and know that I fully understand what your intentions are number one for your significant other number to make sure that I explain\nDetail how does this affect siblings how does this affect estate planning how does this affect the future of that asset you're home so that's why you have to make sure just getting sent over to somebody to go and do counseling is not the answer folks\nDon't cheat yourself\nMeeting with me costs you ... ... nothing and I could let you know what your options are so I Want you to make sure I Want you to make sure that you understand you have options\nOkay in the
