I think goes all the way back to Reagan uh so so yeah there's [laughter] yeah ... ... and\nWell the answer to that question actually is Samantha Power who was are you on a bachelor for forty years but nobody remembers that Brian remembers Susan Rice who served for four years under Brock\nObama a and you might think John Bolton\nServed for a year who is now national security adviser\nA and if you go way back you're talking about people like John Negroponte and bill Richard Senate Madeleine Albright ...
