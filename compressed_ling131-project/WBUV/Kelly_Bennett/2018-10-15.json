T. S. D. and keep people off they're stronger opiates which had become such an\nEpidemic in our country so it'll be interesting to see what will be this yeah um I it I\nI just hope that there are a lot there's a lot more research on the medical benefits it's it's something that I think that there wasn't much research on the medical benefits of marijuana because it was treated by the federal government as early heart drug\nSometimes almost of treated the same way as as you treat heroin or LSD or something like that but we may have missed out on some of some actual medical benefits for people and it would be great to find some medical benefits to this\nI agree yeah and whatever we can do to try to help solve this there'll be a problem I mean I think it's beyond time to do that I mean when we continue to see stories about opiate issues and I especially like I said the huge military population we've got to hear on the coast and\nUh it just people that are dealing with ... he has to be maybe other issues of\nTrauma and that kind of thing and they can help them out I'd love to see this avenue open up to him [noise]\nAll right so we'll continue to follow that that'll be on

before we get your news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Michael our NBC News radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly I'd be Monday\nThank you you know I Know President Trump was on sixty minutes last night if we have time we'd like to get to that but I'm curious about complaints about FEMA and hurricane Michael Kelly been in and I have been through several games here on the Gulf Coast and I think people tend to always have complaints about FEMA\n[laughter] I I think there's actually wallets unwritten for the most part guys I think those rules that even FEMA abide by where they know\nX amount of days into a calendar after hurricane struck that is one of the complaints are going to be I think they have that kind of clarity as well so I don't think this is unexpected but I Do think there's a certain part of this ... when you have the storm the size of hurricane Michael Vick grew\nAs it impacted the Florida Panhandle and exactly what it did to the Florida Panhandle I think now we're starting to see some elements of a little bit more concerned in regards to famous abilities and and what they are and are not doing so in some cases we're seeing reports over the weekend journalists have been out speaking with people in Panama City speaking with people in Mexico\nBeach and I have found in regards as an example one story barber Sanders hunkering down with her daughter in an apartment in Panama City that apartment\nComplex badly damaged but Sanders told reporters not a single relief agency has come out a check on them not one group of organs organization has cut out a check on them at all they said they're not getting any help they need food and water it's just crazy now\nNot to say that they didn't prepare or not have X amount of days of food and water on hand but again this storm a much stronger when it hit land than most people were expecting certainly than they had time to prepare for\nTwo days in advance so um they're out of water and now they're out of food and they're looking for help and there are no female trucks making their way around dropping off any food or water so a block long administrator for FEMA\nOr how does a statement yesterday saying that the system is working their system is working but it takes time when you see devastation like that and he said we have to set all the citizens expectations saying that they have twenty three distribution points where residents could get food water and other essential\nBut it seems guys that probably one of the bigger problems here because Michael\nWas so strong when it came in and so much structure and\nCertainly any areas without electricity\nAnd at best cell service\nThe information is not getting to the people who need it the most right now they're not getting information of these twenty three different places where you could go and get food and water nor do they necessarily have a car that may have been washed away with the flooding went on to be able to get\nThem to one of these twenty three distribution centers and in the case of the woman I was speaking of earlier Sanders um she said the only way that they were able to get water was there was a a group of people a truckload of people are from Louisiana that happened to pack a bunch of water in the waters of bottles\nOf water in the back of that four to five fifty or driving around looking for people dropping off water that way and the question then is why isn't FEMA doing something like that\nOkay well this is um ... as we started the conversation I'm Kelly you're not surprised or you I mean this is um this is ... after every storm like this there are criticisms of FEMA\nYeah and I think it's unfortunate that with the cell towers down in power down I think you're going to see this kind of situation exactly\nAs Michael our explain to you know people that just aren't aware of where to go to get it\n... that there may be help close by they're just not even aware and you know female even admitted black you know there are some areas where we we just we're having trouble getting in there right now it's going to take some time they were talking about food drops this morning Sal and ...\nIt's it's a rough situation for everybody involved in this thing I you know like you said it got strong so fast and it's a situation where a few days ago hurricane supplies is gonna run out on you if you're in a really hard hit areas\nAnd that seems to be as as you mentioned there you know you've had more than\nA few first responders seen it again accessibility to these two cities to these neighborhoods seems to be the biggest challenge so\nFar because of of debris and and wrote about roads are literally crumbling um those kinds of issues and safety getting people to the area which is why as you also mentioned according to governor Rick Scott they were going to start applying some air dropping food and water and some of the hardest hit areas but\nIt's still kind of this information\nNot being able to be exchanged between FEMA and the people who don't have power electricity that should be something that you would think\nOn any normal level any hurricane well there was a category one or a category five they'd be able to remedy that on some level how do they get that information out to the people that should be one of the more important things that they're doing in these communities are they're going to visit and if you have people who can't get there because of their cars were\nWashed away then how do you get that\nFood and water that you've been preparing and talking about your preparation for how you get that to them before it's either too late or in the case of what some of these people are saying is listen you're going to have\nResidents in the area where people from Louisiana helping and bringing food and water until FEMA can get in there and then the ... is going to take all of the all of the pluses and thumbs up for doing this fantastic ... even though they weren't there for a majority of the time\nWe're out of time here didn't have time to get to President Trump on sixty minutes Michael ... thank you for your time this morning you got to have a great rest of your morning thanks\nUri ...
