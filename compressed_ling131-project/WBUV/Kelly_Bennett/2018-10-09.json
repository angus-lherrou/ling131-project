Michael good morning\nOr good morning Oakland or good morning Kelly how are you guys this morning\nWe're well we're glad glad we're not in the cone\nRight exactly\nThat's where you don't want to be right now that's where if you're if you're like oh I Love going a visiting spring break Panama City Florida was the place to go that that's going to be a concern certainly today not only because it's not spring break but also because what according to governor Rick Scott as say this could be a monster storm\nThat is going to be bearing down on some three hundred miles of Florida's coastline and I understand\nThat part's near you guys are going to be getting at least part of the whipping wins in the rains that are going to be coming from this even though it's set to go to Panama City and then from there at least the way it's projected right now\nIt Panama City in the kind of jet off to the right cutting across a Georgia and then will eventually end up through the Carolinas and out of the Atlantic ocean up there a but with that\nRight now category one going to go to a category to more than likely and possibly even a category three status between now and tomorrow when it's set to hit landfall\nYeah I noticed that were on the western side of the hurricane which tends to be a good thing for folks it's the northeast quadrant that has the most dangerous conditions right\n[noise] yeah and they're saying that in just about I guess if you're if you're looking at were Panama City is and where the the the storm is planning on going just to the south and maybe a little bit east of that is where they're saying the strongest storm surge is going to be and that's going to be we're looking at right now again\nStorm surge the deadliest part of these kinds of storms storm surge eight to twelve feet so you're looking at if it gets up to the high end of that well\nThat's twelve feet of water and then waves up on top of that that's over the top of most one story homes\nOn some level so that is going to be dangerous right in that particular\nArea but you also looking at flooding that's going to occur from the rain and then the when that's going to be happening should carry this thing through not only when it hits landfall around Panama City tomorrow but that starts to make its way to Georgia you're seeing maybe some sustained winds ended up thirty five forty mile an hour\nRange through Florida and going into South Carolina and those states are still getting over one Florence it\nThey're not too long ago I mean there are still parts of South Carolina have bridges and roads out and now there's a very big possibility that those winds coming through a lot more power out\nBefore it makes its way off into the Atlantic\nYeah that was a big concern uncle Henry and I talked about that yesterday because it looks like this thing was going to act said in the Carolinas you know we still have books from the Gulf Coast that are going into the Carolinas and taking up collections to try to help those people recover from what happened to them and\nI was in I was speaking to somebody I just recently who\nWhose family had been just outside of Panama City and said that they that they were staying in like some uh uh I could I could go to vacation spot at some level that\nSaid that they had just got finished sort of rebuilding after one of the last tropical storms come through there\nAnd now we're in a place where this big storm is coming through and you're going to have some real big concerns about the damage it's going to a kind of ... and I'm just seeing reports that looks like we may have gotten from Ninety miles an hour winds up to over a hundred miles an hour or one of five seems to be where we're at a at least at this level so this thing is building building\nUgly and it's picking up speed as it makes its way inland um there is a good chance at this rate that you could be seeing at least a hundred and twenty maybe even a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds by the time it makes landfall tomorrow\nI think if there is a good thing I always tried to look for the good and the systems um they had it I mean there are of the best way to do it yeah but I it doesn't look like this is a system that's going to stall like some of the systems that we've dealt with this hurricane season right it's been pretty fast\nYeah Kelly this is not going to be like for its where it's just kind of came in and then sat there off the coast and then just dumped tons of rain and then just slowly moved its way around this is going to be something that like most I Would say\nTypical hurricanes you have kind of come in strong I hit the area that it's targeted towards and then start to die off a little bit as the case you're you're going to see it die out but that doesn't mean you're not going out of the strong winds when it cuts its way across through Georgia and then the Carolinas but yes you're correct at this point it doesn't like it at\nThe prediction is and we all know that this can change but the production is that it's not expected to stall off on any level it's going to just Detroit's forward as it has been and it's been developing speed as it goes I mean it was technically a tropical storm the other day\nAnd then in Maine and managed to pick up speed in with the way that this thing works is you have this rapid intensification or maximum sustained winds increase it thirty five miles per hour\nIn less than twenty four hours twenty four hours or less so that's happened once they're expecting at least another one of those possibly to here in the next twenty four hours\nOr I'm Michael Bauer I've spent the last couple of weeks asking you about the Kavanaugh timeline yeah what is the Michael hurricane Michael timeline when when is that we can we expect the hurricane\nKavanaugh timeline uncle Henry I'll be honest with you it's a little clear\nAt this point the production is\nThat you start to see some heavy with the first of all the indication from all sorts of right now is that if you whatever your plans are for this evening by the time you put your head down your pillow that's pretty much where you're going to be to write this thing out so if you haven't made evacuation plans yet and don't have evacuation plans in order today\nThan where you're going to be staying tonight as we're going to be staying
