to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bill ... good morning\nYour morning uncle and aunt and Kelly and so tell us where is Mike Pompeo going\n[noise] uh this will be a whirlwind trip to the far east I'm not a lot of time for sightseeing here because he will start off in Tokyo or tomorrow into Sunday then moved to North Korea on Sunday down to South Korea Sunday and Monday and he'll cap it off with a stop in Beijing on Monday\nWow okay so yeah that's that's a lot so what what does he hoped to accomplish with the strip\nWell you know what this initially was seen as a trip to North Korea uh to meet with Kim Jong on and to lay out the framework for another summit between the Kim Jong un and President Trump and also talk about that ever elusive denuclearization issue\nBut at this really has turned in I think has turned into a whole different trip\nUh his stop in Beijing on Monday should be particularly interesting uh right now the state department is only saying that he will meet with quote Chinese officials or he's not going to meet with President Xi and now there's a question whether he will even get to meet with any senior Chinese officials because\nOf the United states of course has a pretty long list of grievances now against China ranging from trade all the way down to illegal drugs to hacking at election meddling to a military activities in the south China Sea and then yesterday\nMike Pence drop the hammer delivering just or a blistering speech at a think tank in Washington regarding China he said that what Russia's doing\nPales in comparison to what China's doing and we know that Russia has meddled in our elections\nAre everybody in the world agrees that Russia poisoned that's by in a in a Great Britain or we just had some Russians indicted yesterday by the U.S department of justice so he's saying that that pales in comparison to what China is doing China has said this is ridiculous and that so\nThat makes Mike Pompeo stop in Beijing all the more interesting\nSo and I think you pointed out earlier this week didn't you build them for that that we're getting along better now with North Korea than we are with China [noise]\nWell I I think I uh I pointed out that or or speculated that we may be getting along better with North Korea than we are with Canada right\nNow oh yeah that's right okay well um\nSo how does he said that he's also going to Tokyo had a factor in\nWell he will stop their first he'll meet with prime minister Shinzo Abe's and their foreign minister or there'll be talking number\nOne about about North Korea pan still has some issues they would like to get resolved with North Korea or and they feel the best way to do this may be with us help and a particular interest that Japan has with north\nKorea reportedly allegedly abducted Japanese citizens step to do some of them are still there\nAre so they would like to clear up this issue once and for all with North Korea and also my palm pay will talk to the trade issue for Japan as well we're\nAbout to enter into ... with Japan\nWow so this is a this is quite the trip or when you add all of the stuff with China\nIs an end in a in a short amount of time a party and go on here\nOkay well you know I wasn't sure about ... you know in his Providence city depart [laughter]\nI I don't think he's a party or but are there there's not going to be much argued if he was\nSo um I guess we have to that this was an addition little thing to watch over the weekend a lung cancer\nAnd I wonder Mike Pompeo's
