Sears Iraq under forecast for NATO morning ... generators on showing by the afternoon and news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles [noise] we have\nNews headlines in ten minutes for you right now we want to welcome to the Gulf Coast mornings national correspondent bills for building morning to you\nGood morning uncle Henry come on and how you doing\nWe're doing great uh so the story that top story in the country right now all these mysterious packages what is the latest\nWell the latest is they they are making progress and probably more progress than uh thirties want us to know about at this point but the latest is that yeah things are kind of centered on a postal facility\nIn ... Florida just north of Miami they say now that at least several of these packages that ten packages that have been discovered now\nTravel through this facility which is a a packaging sorting and processing facility which is a huge postal operation\nBut this is a big development because they can now a track the movements of these packages and maybe even get back to the point of origin which could lead to a video surveillance of who may have actually put this package\nIn the mail to begin with their even self service kiosks at this facility a there where people can drop packages so all of those things will now be examined and could lead to the people ultimately responsible\nThe other part of his uncle Henry is the devices themselves continue to be analyzed at the uh terrorist explosive device analytical center down at Quantico\nAnd uh at this point there appears to be more evidence or getting a lot of reports that these devices would not have gone off\nThat are they in some cases contained pyrotechnics element like out it might be anything from a gunpowder to a phosphorus to a sulfur based type of substance but uh there was no apparent triggering mechanism meaning that uh they yeah they they could have been dangerous but there's nothing there that would have made them go off\nBuilds up or is it likely that there are other packages that haven't been found yet\nAuthorities say we have to be wary of this and we had some false alarms yesterday or last night the building that CNN is in New York City was a part of it was evacuated again where they thought it was a false alarm\nThey said there may still be more out there even though it's been twenty four hours now ah and that they say they must be considered viable explosives that they are potentially destructive devices even though as I said the evidence seems to be mounting that these would not have gone off\nSo we've uh with the twenty four hour news networks you get a few facts and then you you're left with twenty three hours of speculation yeah a has any of the is any of the speculation uh been on target to or I've heard the interesting theory or that it could be a foreign entity\nYeah I I think that has to be considered here especially due to the fact that this could be considered another form of election meddling so to speak and we've heard a lot about that through social media and such but this could be considered another form of that just to throw the whole process into\nA little bit more of mayhem and to fuel speculation on both sides whether it be a Republican or Democrat or right wing or left wing\nFuel a speculation and rumors on both sides as to who might be responsible for this and to create more of a divide\nA than we already have in this country ... between the political parties so I think that that is a viable explanation I'm sure it's something that the authorities are looking into\nSo bills for you you mentioned that there's a lot to the authorities know and they're probably not letting us know yet or is there any any timeline that we can count on should we should we expect this to be resolved a week from now\nThis is also interesting I I Believe that the investigation is ... is progressing quick enough that we could have a an arrest sometime in the next week or so but\nThere is now some speculation uncle Henry that if there isn't harassed made that the tails of it would not be released until after the midterm elections are so as not to\nYou'll uh the the ire of one party or the or another or to damage a either party before the midterm elections now that is completely a unsubstantiated at this point but it is certainly something that a is an interesting aspect of this whole\nThing well and that's something that I also wondered about because certainly a if there's an indication that that whoever did this is leaning really hard in one direction or the other politically um the the opposing sides going to want to make the most of that\nYeah especially to if this is I mean as we've heard some speculate that this is a democratic hopes that it actually is democratic supporters who wanted to create the situation in order to damage the Republican Party is found out\nThat that is the reason for this or it could have an impact on the mid term elections so yeah that's a that's a question to keep in mind as we move ahead but I think this investigation is moving ahead fast enough that we could have a some action taken in the next week or so\nWhere we're at a time bills for thank you You're welcome have a great weekend\nYou should have their egos bills for NBC News radio Kelly been just imagine we\nHave all this going on a before the midterms can you imagine what it's going to be like in our next election for president\nWow
