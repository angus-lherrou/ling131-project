N. T. M. Ninety nine to five and the drag immobile with the news headlines coming up with about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly how are you this morning doing\nGreat I'm very curious about Kavanaugh and will he will there actually be an effort to impeach him because I Can't remember somebody trying to impeach a Supreme Court justice before\nI Would say uncle and and killing the effort is there now whether it's successful or not we don't know at this point but we know that even prior to his swearing in and frankly I think even maybe prior to to Susan Collins giving her speech on the floor a petition had already begun\nAnd now that petition to impeach Kevin I was gathered over a hundred and twenty five thousand signatures we know that progressive groups are are raising money to raise money to expel them from the federal bench at least one key democratic lawmakers promised to investigate the judge if the party retake the house in November and now the key to that is\nIf the party retake the house in November So all of this on both sides for Democrats and Republicans are going to add up to what happens here in the mid term elections and and this cabinet\nAppointment and the Kavanaugh swearing in is going to be a giant part of that Republicans hailing not just the swearing in is a watershed moment the Pell their party to the midterms but also highlighting how Democrats\nActed going back to the very beginning of the cabinet confirmation hearings where we saw uh the protesters and what were we saw Democrats interrupting every couple of seconds to complain that they didn't have filed all of that is something that they are going to use all the way up to the very end here and how they they brought these charges against cabinet that were\nUnheard of and and and and President Trump saying not only should a cabin or be able to get the nomination and get sworn in but also should be able to sue ah Christine Blasey Ford for liable\nOn some level so all of that part of it is going to play into the next four and a half weeks share what we've got mid term elections coming up and who was able to bring more people to the table\nYeah well it sounds like what you've just said ah if if there is a noticeable effort to try in position to impeach him or investigate him that's going to help the Republicans isn't it\nI think it's true I think that's a very good point I Do think that that's the case 'cause it just highlights again with the Democrats are willing to do and I think you even got some some Democrats who are lifelong Democrats who are really concerned about this element of for the impeachment part the more progressive\nPart of of the Democratic party being the ones who are fired up behind this portion of it and I think you've got the the more moderate\nDemocrats going what will will will hold on a second here listen let's get people to the voting booth let's give them a message or something that they can count on instead of just impeached this guy or not that\nGuy won pointing at President Trump and they don't have that as of right now now is it still possible that this is all just sort of a movement to try to win over millennial voters who may be you know in the past certainly haven't come out to the polls to vote and maybe needs some sort of a small reason to do it without getting into the ... the ... version of the\nPolitical D.C world they just need some sort of something to stand behind perhaps a hash tag like me too that they can do that with\nThat sounds like a good plan but is it going to bring them to the voting\nPolls we don't know in those people the millennials are generally not people who are answering much much of the the precursor ripples that we look at it now\nAnd so Michael our what what is that we know the reaction from the the two political parties what about other reaction are we getting reaction from the judicial community itself\nYou you certainly are um we do know that the former dean of the Yale Law school where Kavanaugh education um is calling out the cabinet out confirmation\nHe actually refer to it as an American tragedy and has said that the new Supreme Court justice is a black robe embodiment of raw partisan power inconsistent with any ideals\nAn impartial judiciary so and this is what he's saying is that the testimony that judge Kavanaugh gave to the Senate Judiciary committee where he was very defensive um he said that that in of itself when he called on Democrats when he called out the Clintons when he called out everybody in that fiery speech that\nIs part is that as a partisan power and that does not sit well when you're talking about the Supreme Court ah where you're supposed to be impartial\nIn regards to the judiciary in the meantime chief justice John Roberts has received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints in recent weeks against\nBrett Kavanaugh most of those centering on the statements that he made during his Senate confirmation hearing so that fiery speech you you saw from him that the Republicans are touting as most importantly his ability to stand up for himself and clear his good name may come back to haunt him here on a judiciary\nKind of a level where that highlights of partisanship at a less of an ability which we know for a fact\nThat the the Supreme Court and more importantly chief John Roberts the chief justice John Roberts and trying to make sure the courts legitimacy in standing as a neutral arbiter isn't primo spotlight form this is going to challenge\nWhere well Kelly better than I we're hoping that we will be done with this Michael by or I guess where we are now you need\nTo know I was hoping to be done with the to trust me I was hoping to be talking about something completely different than cabinet this morning but here we are All right Michael ... thank you for your time today you gotta guys have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent wow Kelly been we could be talking about this for months arguing sign it sounds like it no\nNot excited I'll just be honest [laughter]\nYou know what I Wonder about\nPeople that signed these petitions and stuff like that if they really feel
