M. and Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile where news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get\nTo the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning good morning uncle Henry come on and Kelly my\nSo Kanye West meeting President Trump I knew it was going to be out of the ordinary but I really did not expect how out of the ordinary it turned out to be\n[noise] yeah I don't think anybody did uncle Henry and now this was a good idea oh that the president had get together a lot better lives from the African American\nCommunity to talk about policy policy issues like prison response in inner cities and specifically Chicago maybe gang influences on young people and things like that pretty good idea but today after this and and Kanye West's are almost like a stand up routine during the meeting\nUm there's one question that people are asking that I still haven't heard an answer to and it is what was that\nI [laughter] I mean it we really are trying to figure out exactly what happened here I mean\nKanye West talked about everything from alternate universes to the thirteenth amendment which I got rid of slavery to hydrogen aircraft to the second amendment to comparing his comments do wind to hugging the president\nAnd yes that dropping the F bomb in the oval office uh so uh ... you know what I compare this to uncle Henry and and uh I I Know you'll understand this and you probably will to Kelly I think he's like the uh\nThe enigma machine that the Germans used during World War two you know there's a message\nIn there somewhere but it got awfully hard to find it okay\nSo that's what he was not alone in this meeting with President Trump there were other people there\nYeah a Jim Brown or the NFL legend was sitting there as well as some other representatives too and one was an attorney we didn't hear them speak at all uh Jim Brown spoke a little bit but the Kanye West dominated the whole time\nWell I I've I've noticed some of the records ... you'll hear a brief clip and it sounds pretty coherent and in might even be something that you agree with from a policy standpoint but as you pointed out if you listen to the whole thing\nUh it's it's almost like you might want to worry about Kanye that he's okay\nWell hey that's one of the reactions coming out today a uncle Henry as a as ...\nConcerned for Conyers of course he was hospitalized what was described as a temporary psychosis and later diagnosed with bipolar disorder or and or at but he'd yesterday during this that thing in the White House said that it was sleep deprivation and not a bipolar\nOr so for that reason he has discontinued any kind of medical regimen for that and those close to him are concerned about this\nOr that they say that that he should be back on his regular medical regimen or that he is a band and and and for that reason there is concern about Kanye also uh some criticism coming out of course for the president that\nUh he allowed this to continue on at the same time that uh we had a the wall by you know the ... going down another five hundred points and we're seeing all the scenes of devastation\nIn from Florida and the death toll rising and we have a serious foreign policy issue developing with Saudi Arabia or but yet the president allowed ... to go on his rent for about Fifteen minutes\nWell what about fall out for ... sorry Kelly Bennett\nYeah we're getting a lot of reaction are you know there has\nBeen some ... other reaction to this saying that uh that was it was great for the put in to do that and he is he's a carrot ups\nOn important issues but then you have others like another rapper TI you know I'm not familiar with them but apparently a colleague of ... called it repulsive and disgraceful an embarrassing axle rose from gums and roses actually a responded calling it a joke a Don Lemon the CNN commentator said he called it a minstrel show\nSo it really uh most of the reaction we see was very critical\nOf of of Conyers' performance will say during this meeting\nYou've got to wonder if the president is thinking to themselves that you know he is going to touch on some important topics with some\nInfluential people like Kanye because it's such a loose screw I mean I think most of us remember him most\nFrom the uh American music awards I think it was where ... Taylor Swift was getting an award and he came up and interrupted and said beyond say deserved it I I Will if he's got a mental issue or if he's just an attention seekers and he does this kind of thing on purpose\nI think it's a little of both actually you know a\nBoy this diagnosis or a couple of years ago a perhaps a some type of a mental disorder or medical disorder Andy yeah see of course he's attention seeking he's a he's a celebrity he's he's a an entertainer of course he has attention seeking so I think it's a combination of both\nNow he really wanted them I'm Sorry go ahead or he's taken a lot of grief ... supported President Trump that which I think is really interesting and here's why because\nWe are so politically divided in this country right now that you can't talk politics it seems without an argument [noise]\nBullock we're at a time we could [noise] what what you got ... million axle rose we could talk for hours on this topic [laughter] but we don't have time bill ... thank you for your time have a great weekend\nYou to ...\nAnd Kelly been at it I Will be back with you after the news trafficking whether with more Gulf Coast ...
