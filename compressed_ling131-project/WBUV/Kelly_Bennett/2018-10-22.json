correspondent bills ever built good morning\nAnd go Henry mourning mourning Kelly marshal the migrant caravan how much is it grown\nWell there are some estimates now that goes highest ten thousand a year remember this started off as about a hundred fifty people\nIn Honduras and\nHas steadily grown and with other people joining in and all the publicity that this has gotten is helping this uh but now you know the estimates are as high as ten thousand people are involved in this caravan which is in southern Mexico the big bulk of it anyway after we all saw the\nImages over the weekend of people gathered on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico or they were waiting there to be processed and got impatient some ended up swimming across the river being drafted across the river others just pushed down the fence and streamed through so we do have this group in southern Mexico now\nSo what's the latest in could they actually make it to the U.S border\n[noise]\nStill a long way to go there a Kelly over a thousand miles remain to be covered by this group so still a long way to go and Mexico continues to try to tell these people are look I come to the processing center we will grant you asylum\nAnd and we'll go from there in fact they have started placing buses now along this route because we're also seeing other suffering among the people we've seen children suffering effects of the heat or that they have encountered and the elderly with that might have some health issues or others are are are beginning to feel the pressure here\nPhysically up this track so what Mexico has done has started placing buses along the route\nAnd telling the people look anytime you're ready to jump on the bus will take you over the to the processing center you will be granted asylum in Mexico a dust bar a lot of people have been unwilling to do that fearing that it will only result in them being sent back to their home country so\nUh we'll make it to the United states they got a long way to go\nSit in the meantime you talk about how many thousands of people this has now become and you know they're being offered asylum and ... but I'm kind of curious as to the conditions that they're under yeah what kind of a relief efforts are underway or their groups and they're kind of helping them out making sure that they're bad\nOr they have water\nHow's that situation being worked out\nWell you know we don't have any reports of organized effort by humanitarian groups but what we do a report solve is a tremendous gestures by the locals are along the route here who have gone out to meet\nThis caravan or in some cases giving them everything from a from a water to a shoes\nTo money in a you know there are some cases of people handing out their own money to some of these people to give them a little bit of cash on the way through so are there have been a lot of gestures whether they're organized humanitarian effort so we haven't heard of groups that are involved in that but I'm sure they will be a just because of all the publicity that as\nGenerated by this caravan uh so uh but uh the conditions continue to be bad\nSo what are we going to do if they get here\nAnd that's a that's the magic questionnaire uncle Henry the president has talked about uh putting our military down at the border\nOr if they do make it to the United states okay even if we have our military there what do you do I mean you can't have a violent response to what these people are doing you could we have an arrangement with Mexico now where we can just turn them away we don't have to\nPut them into the process at their request asylum we can just turn them away but then what happens do they set up migrant camps along the border\nHoping to get across any way they can even if it's the illegally uh so that that remains the big question here but in the past\nThese groups that have started off in Central America and have to have the trek through Mexico have really dwindled as they are the farther north they get ah so I Would imagine that we're going to see a smaller much smaller number that has gathered now if and when they get to the United states and truthfully now\nA what a Honduras Guatemala Mexico I've been unable to do Mother Nature may be able to do because we've got a hurricane that is ready to hit western Mexico could be a category five hurricane\nIt is north of where this caravan is but still a what effects they will encounter a as they move north remains to be seen and and could cause problems for them\nWhich so is so bills for the ... you may not know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask it any way no how this number of of up to ten thousand how does that compare to what normally we have crossing the border because I keep hearing reports that some spots have four thousand apprehensions a week\nYeah uh well the numbers from a September alone were pretty impressive ah for the month of September there were forty thousand people are detained at the border as illegal immigrants\nUh so uh I mean that that the numbers are pretty big uh so you know even though this ten thousand people is really a drop in the bucket when you look at all the picture altogether but just the fact that these guys are coming from all the way from Central America\nIs what is really drawing attention ... thank you for your time today You're welcome\nThank you for
