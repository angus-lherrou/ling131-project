I Would have been devastating knowing could have been devastating to the campus and the people none of it to them a bridge above it and so I mean it was this something that desperately needed to be done and just one of those things that are grown over a period of time and really not been noticed\nYou know the water supply being able to get togethers and you've got to really as a as a leash campus of liquid underneath the other side and you know I blew it was if I have to that is such a big a passerby\nBut should the reporters that hurdle that figured that that meant that it was being

be\nYeah you know a public safety at a Mardi Gras parade especially when you're really on the route where everybody gathers then you've got lots and lots of vehicles and it's a big issue and you do

Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on news talk one for nine WVU being Biloxi [noise] and on news radio seven ten WN ... who's headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national corresponded\n... good morning morning uncle Henry on a Kelly morning\nSo bills for outlined forests what's going to happen with our military and the southern border\nYeah this is active US military is being deployed as we speak to the border between the United states and Mexico there even giving at a name at the Pentagon it's\nCalled operation faithful patriot where these fifty two hundred troops will join the two thousand National Guard troops that have already been at the border and they will be assigned in a support role role they will not be actively engaged with immigrants coming to the U.S border\nBecause they can't do that by law of the law says that the U.S military can cannot directly and force\nUs domestic law including immigration law without congressional approval or so they will be there in a support role they will be there with a military police there will be pilots who will be a will be flying helicopters and fixed wing aircraft with night vision equipment along the border area to help the border patrol\nOr there will be engineers working on roads and also to fortify sections of the fence that may need it along the border uh but uh do some of those service members have already started arriving at staging areas in South Texas Arizona and California\nAnd then it will be decided exactly where they will be deployed along the border but it's not I'll go Henry and Kelly like we're we're putting these troops all along the border area there with rifles trained at immigrants heading north of that will not be the case\nWell I'm kinda curious because when we talked to yesterday the caravan was growing so where do we stand in regard to the numbers and the caravan\nWell now it's it's getting smaller as as you might expect because they're still about eight hundred miles away from the U.S border and they'd had been well the estimates are all over the place the hurt upwards of ten thousand at one point now uh they say it's about thirty five hundred may have broken up into different groups\nUh but uh people are either a deciding that this is just not going to happen I mean going with young children and our or babies in some cases all the way to the U.S border uh and they may be accepting offers of asylum and unemployment assistance that Mexico has offered\nA so there are some people that are are taking that route\nAnd then it appears that the Mexican authorities are beginning to step things up a little bit yesterday there were six hundred a group of six hundred who got on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico try to get into Mexico and they were blocked by Mexican federal police and told a turnaround\nA so a combination of things would lead you to believe that if this caravan or the caravans\nOr continue to move toward the U.S border the numbers will up drastically dwindled by the time they get here\nBuilds up for so many things in the country seem to be coming to a boil right before we vote yes so when are when do we expect this caravan to actually get close to the border will they get there before we vote\nNo uh no they they can't no way they can go these eight hundred miles in one week\nOr so they will not get there but there's a reason you're hearing about all these things right now because uh the the president wants to get his immigration policy out there\nBefore the midterm elections are for something that can be voted on\n... and gain supportive Republican voters and those who agree with his immigration policies so they're getting all of these policies out there now or so they can be a factor in the mid term elections even though this deployment of the five thousand plus troops is scheduled to last until\nDecember fifteenth that could always be extended so they're going to be there till at least mid December and it may take some\nImmigrants that long to get there\nSo when they get their what happens well the president has\nNow said ah if they get there if and when they get there we're going to set up tent cities are that when they get to the border and request asylum or we will say okay I hear you have to stay in this tent\nAnd a and a weight you're processing\nAlso he let it be known that the asylum process is going to be very stringent in fact uh the new numbers and show that for fiscal year twenty Eighteen those granted asylum amounted to only thirty three percent of the total people uh that showed up at the border\nSo that is expected to go down even more he's telling people it may take months as well so if you come up here you're going to be put in a tent city and held they're not released until you can be evaluated for asylum and not many people are going to get it if you don't get asylum you're headed back home\n\n... well uh I guess all the time for one more question are we are we going to be here it as much about this after the after the midterms or is this going to go off the front pages\nI think it all depends on how this a caravan holds together I mean if it begins to dwindle I think it'll disappear from the news cycle or if it holds together and they continue to get closer to the to the U.S border then we will hear about it again but you know how things have been going out oh Henry a\nThere is undoubtedly something gonna come up between now and
