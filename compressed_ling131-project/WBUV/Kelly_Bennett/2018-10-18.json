coming up here in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael Bauer Michael good morning\nWanting a call and good morning Kelly Abby Thursday guys\nHappy Thursday to you too so what is the latest on the investigation into the missing Saudi journalist\nWell if you saw the footage yesterday the hazmat suits that were from the Turkish investigators are those those Turkish investigate it and the suit searching the Saudi council general's residence and is\nTumble yesterday and made the world news every\nA country that I could possibly see what's out there with cameras they were all filming it it looked like a giant press it was like it was like an Olympics of the press sitting right out in front of the Saudi council general's residence now the reason they were doing that and this was made very clear by Turkish\nOfficials as they released transcripts of this audio tape that they had a in their in their possession um\nIt was eleven minutes long in that audiotape or not only does it details the death of what they believe was Mr ... not only dead within minutes beheaded dismembered a according to reports he was tortured immediately as he walked through the door they began cutting off fingers and then within a two hour time frame that from the time you walk into the door\nUntil two hours later they were completely the killers were gone\nEverything was done and taking care of an out of the the consulate there\nBut one of the voices that they heard on the tape during that entire process was that of the council general who was saying to the people who had been conducting the torture and what they believe is the eventual death of ... are saying to them do this outside you're going to put me in trouble\nToo which are those individuals set back to the council if you want to live when you come back to rape you you'll shut up so that kind of lead the Turks to believe all the council gentle on some levels involved in this let's go check his residence and car and\nThey wanted to do that two weeks ago guys but they were not allowed by Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia would not allow them to go search that and frankly the Turks didn't have any access until forty eight hours ago when that council general\nFled the country of turkey to go back to Saudi Arabia\nSo where where does this go now is it going to be is there going to be an effort to find out who knew what in the Saudi Government about this\n[noise] yeah that's going to be one of the big calls\nRight now that seems to be kind of ... where the investigation is going for the Turkish justice minister says that the the the investigation's ongoing but it's expected to be concluded soon but they're also saying that they're growing indication that possible video evidence that the men allegedly responsible for the death of ...\nHad close ties to the highest level of the Saudi Government uh we do know that when Mike Pompeo went to visit with the Saudi or the Saudi crown prince the other day and no uncertain terms according to sources he told the crowd print that he was going to have to own\nThis situation and that every fact whatever those backs were every fact would eventually come out so Mike Pompeo kind of highlighting or for the crown prince that even if we're not going to talk about facts right now just know that\nEverything's going to come out at some point in time so if there's anything you want to get off your chest now or anything you want to get off your chest relatively soon would probably be best to do that\nSo there has been a talk in the beginning as we were looking into the\nThe what we now know as the debt that this journalist and you know President Trump was promising severe punishment he's kinda backtracked on the statements so what do you think that means I'm In in regard to our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI Would say that right now the relationship with Saudi Arabia is good in Saudi Arabia has to understand that you know the U.S under the pressure to to have to ask the call as more and more this information comes out I mean you know you've got President Trump yesterday saying that he's not giving cover to Saudi Arabia he wants to find out what happened\nWho's at fault and then he believes it by the end of the week you'll have that information so in the meantime he's trying to deny that he's covering on any level but\nAs this goes on as more and more the details and some forensics are going to start to come out\nIt's going to be harder to do anything but point the finger at Saudi Arabia on some level here and the possibility of the higher up the\nFood chain within the Saudi Government that goes so there's going to be those kinds of of curious parts to this and then questions that need to be answered and with that Kelly go Henry this is on the heels of Tuesday a U.S receiving a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia right at the same date my palm pale arrived there\nNow this was something that was pledged to the U.S back in August in regards to stabilizing efforts in Syria but the imagery the optics\nOf getting a payment right in the middle of this investigation right\nAs President Trump has kind of been saying the Saudis one of our uh our our our our greatest allies and then the payment of a hundred million dollars comes through the optics of that look weird and that's where people are starting to question when you couple that with some senators saying that the Trump Administration\nHas a canceled intelligence meetings that we're supposed to be\nIn regards to the ... disappearance and that according to Bob Corker\nWhen Trump Administration says they are refusing to share any information with the senators going forward at this point so there are more questions that are coming up into what the president knows and isn't sharing and making transparent with not only the world but with our own government\nMichael about where we're at a time for this morning but thank you for your time today\nYou got to have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael Bauer\nNews radio national correspondent a very\nVery messy of course a horrible horrible story ... ... each day the details\nGet more horrible as we hear hear what that uh that audio tape allegedly has an a and also messier diplomatically\nNow we're at a time for this hour of Gulf Coast mornings Kelly been mentioned Facebook earlier we our lives you can watch what happens during commercial
