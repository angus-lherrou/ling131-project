I felt a little caught off guard that it was that it was directed at the Jewish community even though I Know there's a long history\nOf anti Semitism in the world and we know the horrible things that have happened I just didn't think that we had something like that in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah well there has been an increase over the last couple of years in twenty six team the FBI reported a a thirty five percent increase in anti Semitic crimes are twenty Seventeen there was a fifty seven percent increase in incidents\nSo uh it really is something that has been on the uptick and when you look at the over the past several weeks we've had that shooting up and Louisville, Kentucky that has now been declared a hate crime\nOr the the packages last week that could be considered political hate\nUh then you get this abhorrent incident over the weekend it really brings to the forefront once again that there are many different issues that bring out the hate and different people and different organizations across the country a and there's one estimate that there's many a thousand hate groups out there a\nCoast to coast ranging from anti immigrant anti gay to black nationalist to white supremacist to all across the board or so there is an awful lot of hate out there and I really think that and it played a part in the Pittsburgh shooting as well\nSocial media not the reason for these things but they certainly is a factor and all of these things because number one this social media platform gab dot com that this uh uh Bowers guy was on I had never even heard of before\nAnd a number one you can get your views out there anonymously number two you can find like minded individuals and uh you can encourage each other and and that could become an inflammatory situation and the third part of it is these are all hot button issues\nThat foreign entities have trolls are social media with a Russian meddling having to do with race issues in this country and racial bias religious bias immigrant issues they ... they poke at all of these things to try to inflame us here in this country and you know what I'll go Henry it's working\nWell the ... and you mentioned social media so are you speaking from the standpoint that these groups or people that have had these opinions have always been out there but it's now so much easier for them to find each other\nAbsolutely a number one to get your views out there whereas before al yeah you could get a Yankee grab a bullhorn and go to a street corner or a ... but now I mean all you have to do is go on and apparently this gab dot com\nOr was a website that while they their uh their approach was freedom of speech at a at a denigrate it into a hate site\nA that a track to people who wanted to get their messages have hate out there so you can get your message out there very easily and find other people who feel the same way\nSo are there any effort underway to maybe put an end to this particular side have you heard anything in that regard\nIt's down now or whether it will come back\nRemains to be saying that it would be hard to believe that uh that they could justify coming back on especially if it generates the same type of talk that it that it has and again\nI I for one I'd never even heard of it before this uh so it's down now I Would imagine it probably will not come up unless they they might bring it back up under a different name or something just to uh just to do that but if if this was one we don't know about that's out there how many others are there\nWell we'll build super you you mentioned um these estimates of how many hate groups that are out there and I'm sure the definition is going to vary from from person to person and also from who's doing the counting what about what about the government do does the government keep track of what they consider hate groups\nWell what the yes they do a and homeland security uh watches this as well as the ... the intelligence agencies and the FBI and in fact the FBI and it's interesting to me that they have only been tracking hate related crimes since Nineteen Ninety two\nAre and what they show as well as we hit an all time low and twenty fourteen since then since twenty fourteen the last four years uh we've been on the increase\nAnd die as so there has been a trend going up word\nNot only in this country but worldwide I mean when you look at Europe when you look at South America and when you look at the middle east you look a lot of different areas where this is also on the increase maybe for some of the same reasons is that it's happening here\nUh but uh but this was not a trend just it's just exclusive to the United states and and really when you look at it are these type of issues in this country have been around for a long time I mean when people were\nEmigrating in the in the early Nineteen hundreds and\nYou know certain ethnic groups whether it be the Italians are the Irish or the Germans ... weren't allowed to live in certain areas of cities and things like that it's been around for a long time\nOr it will bills for um [noise] it it's it's yeah it's been around for a long time and it seems like something very hard to combat\nYeah almost impossible uh other than a a a dramatic change in social attitudes and uh that is something that may never happen I you know it really is very difficult\nWhere we're at a time bill super thank you for your time today You're welcome uncle Henry [noise] their egos bills in for NBC News radio national correspondent\n[noise]\nWherever
