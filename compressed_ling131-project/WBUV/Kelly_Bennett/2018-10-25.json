with more uh caravans right now are Michael power not yet joining us but we do have some info for you on that issue on that story\nYeah President Trump defending suggestions that the migrant caravan contain some suspected terrorists from the Mid East smart Mayfield has that report\nAt the White House on Tuesday he said he had some very good information but when he was pressed for details you\nSeemed less sure there's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything but they could very well be\nVice president my parents said the president of Honduras told him this was organized by a leftist groups in Honduras and financed by Venezuela a caravan of several thousand migrants continues a slow walk through Mexico headed to the U.S border President Trump said\nThey're not coming in you said he will deploy the military if he needs to mark Mayfield NBC News radio\nOkay so so we're hearing that um what we just heard was that Honduras is claiming that Venezuela is paying for this or was was providing some money for this\nYes and you know there was a situation where I was hearing there was more than one caravan now\nAnd so how many people there were seven thousand and the first one and it was said to be growing and the one time I talked about it and I think you know\nThe concern is secure the border it's very possible that some people with some very bad intentions have worked their way into these caravans and they want to do harm to the United states [noise]\nWell ... yes I'm there there's really no way to know who might be in the Caribbean one way or the other uh also um\nI've heard some reports that said that that we used to see just single males trying to make their way in and that has changed in the last year where you see lots of young men accompanied by a young women\nAnd they're all these claims that it may be a part of human trafficking or it may be a scheme or as an easier way to get in if you if you bring a youngster with you\nTo get across the border um but it's hard to sort through all this right I mean 'cause uh\nThere's it's difficult to know from where we are all the people might be in the Caribbean\nWell and not only that but I think if you interview them all individually you still necessarily wouldn't be able to pull bad guys from the good guys or because they've got their stories to tell right so right security wise it's got to be a nightmare to think about all these people and\nIt it's just a a situation that it looks like it continues to get 'em bigger you know it's a bigger situation for folks to try to handle as\nWe are talking I was trying to look and see if I see something new on this story that I could share with everybody but I'm really not I'm just [noise]\nYou know and Michael about yes\nJust you want to open your arms and help people out that her in a bad situation you have a lot of compassion for people and that really want to come to this country for the right reasons but there's there's a way to do it and there are people that are making their way here\nYou're legally\nAnd you don't ... you know there's there's a line forming I think there's a process\nRight\nOr as you pointed out work country that a lot of us especially in modern times\nUh ... like the story of the immigrants that come here legally and and um is here to work for a better life it's it's something that a lot of us are descended from mhm um but\nThe ... this looks more like chaos right\nYes and it's something that that we we've got to be careful with no doubt it's certainly a mess it looks like it's going to be an even bigger one is we go forward and it looks like no we will have no update today from Michael ... our ... like because we have not heard from him on the story\nBut we'll keep you up to date on it it's something
