him for Bill good morning\nHey going I'll go and read them on and Kelly\nIn which you've gotta you've got a story to tell us about this is something that that I have not been able to to pay full attention to we bet a lot going on in the last week or so tell us about the missing Saudi journalist\nYeah this story is kind of a combination of international espionage and and the ... the mob or it it really is something that uh you could see a as a as a a spy movie or something having to do with something like that here here's the situation\nIt it surrounds man by the name of Joe ... show ... who was a Saudi journalist\nWho left Saudi Arabia really for his own protection after writing articles that had been critical of the royal family and a religious leaders in Saudi Arabia he moved to this country lived in Virginia became a contributor for the Washington Post\nHe hasn't been seen since October second when he went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in order to get paperwork he needed to marry a Turkish woman\nSo uh the investigation is underway and Turkish investigators have come up with a scenario where they say that the show was murdered inside the Saudi consulate and may have been dismembered\nI in fact they have identified a Fifteen Percent hit squad they say flew in from Saudi Arabia to conduct this act now this has taken on international implications now since\n... was a resident of the United states his fiance is now calling on President Trump to get involved and twenty two senators have now signed on to\nA request for an investigation into this incident and this was something that really could have a lot of foreign policy implications for the United states and Saudi Arabia which has become a valuable ally\nAnd so I'm On that the Trump Administration is relying on for everything from a military cooperation to cooperation any global oil market so this is a real balancing act that the Trump Administration is on here as we try to get to the bottom of what happened to ...\nOkay so why or what is what is it about him that would require a death squad being dispatched\nWell when you write articles in Saudi Arabia that our number one critical of the royal family and number two critical of religious leaders you become an enemy of the state uh in fact a U.S intelligence reportedly intercepted communications\nWhere a Saudi authorities wanted to lure 'cause she'll be back to Saudi Arabia and then detain him there\nNow they haven't discovered anything that would lead to the fact that they would murder him\nA but still there he was was considered an enemy of the state in Saudi Arabia\nBuilds up or do you think we can trust the intel from turkey\n[noise] I I don't know it it seems to me that it's pretty clear though this much we do know there is surveillance video that shows could show ... entering the consulate there is no video evidence of him ever leaving the cop Gillette even though Saudi Arabia says yo yeah he left\nA there is no video evidence and despite the fact there are cameras inside the Saudis say they were not recording at the time and it even gets more diabolical than this or he when he went to the consulate it was early in the afternoon and all consulate members had been given the afternoon off\nA so it really adds up to the possibility that there was some type of conspiracy are underway and Turks Turkish officials have laid it out they even believe now there's a possibility that his remains may be buried in the garden of the consul general in Istanbul\nWow this is the what a horrible story yeah\nYeah really it really is and uh you can imagine how his fiance must field [laughter]\nOh yeah ... ... this I'm I'm surprised that a turkey has all of this very specific um in information that they were able to figure out\nYeah and they have tracked a couple of private air flights that went from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul they say that these are the flights that carry this Fifteen person squad\nOr into Saudi Arabia they have already checked the surveillance video and now the search is underway for apparently Mr could show we wore one of those apple watches\nA so they say if they can find that\nUh it would tell you things like his his heart everything from his heart rate to his location\nOr so or they are or the investigation continues and meanwhile in this country uncle Henry they're already been calls from some including Senator Chris Murphy that the U.S needs to rethink its military political\nAnd economic relationships with Saudi Arabia all of which run very deep\nWell and we've been hearing this since nine eleven right\nOh yeah absolutely a cause that yeah there are Saudi connections to nine eleven as well\nBut then they become a valuable ally of the United states in that region both militarily and you remember President Trump recently requested Saudi Arabia increase their oil production and over in order to stabilize the global oil market so we have a lot of connections to two and a the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was recently\nAs the White House ah [laughter] so there are a lot of close connections to Saudi Arabia we are at a time builds up for
