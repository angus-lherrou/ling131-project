Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly unhappy ones they to you both\nThat'd be Wednesday so I I was quite shocked yesterday when I was hearing the news that the FBI investigation could be over today or tomorrow is that right\nYeah there was even talk guys are they could've been done as of yesterday for the wall Street Journal officially as reported that although the FBI had until friday to complete the investigation both GOP eight and a person Tamil here with the matter expected to wrap up\nWell beforehand so that means it could be today it could be tomorrow it gets to travel and it tomorrow on some level or in either case certainly giving the timeframe for Mitch McConnell to get his friday vote in while still having time to review the FBI Files and documents regardless investigation clearly fits into that pencil then time for it right out now\nThat said the FBI investigation according to lawyers for Dr Blass Z Ford and ... should be in question uh they both independently lawyer and law groups complained independently yesterday that the FBI was not pursuing important leads we know Dr Blass before it has not yet been\nInterviewed by the FBI nor have the witnesses that they identified as being at the party when this whole a legit sexual assault took place are those people that they thought could corroborate their story had not been interviewed by the FBI either according to these lawyers so they both on\nCompletely independent of each other wrote letters to the FBI and the chief counsel to let them know that they thought that this investigation wasn't question\nSo so then then where do we go from here I mean as I Know people are going to complain that the FBI investigation\nOver early and that certain people weren't talked about a ... do you think this the the FBI will be told to try again or is it all going to be done\nI Can't fathom them I Can't fathom anybody agreeing to hey go back to the drawing board or get back to picking this up and continuing your investigation I Can't fathom that having especially when Mitch McConnell is so dead set on having this vote on friday\nBut I Will say this on behalf of the FBI to defend them at all but what we're hearing in regards to the FBI investigation is that this has become sort of an all hands on deck\nElement to this investigation they are sending in everybody from a brand new newbies in the FBI to conduct investigations and get some information to\nThe seasoned veterans who are very familiar with interviewing people to come off of cases in order to sit down with people involved in this particular case so it's very possible that this could be an expedient element to this because of the manpower that they're putting into it I guess that's been going to weigh on whatever it is Jeff Flake\nOr Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski are all see and the two red state Democrats who are kind of all up in the air\nI think if they don't see what they consider to be a full investigation like if you don't actually go back and talk to Christine lousy forward at some point I don't know you can call this a complete investigation and that's going to throw their votes and the question\n\nSo what about ... what about like his he already told us that he's not going to vote that he thinks the capitals to political so is he going to be an automatic no\nThat's a really good question and I I feel like that game has been up to a little bit from the based upon what President Trump did yesterday in his rally where he was kind of mocking Christine Blasey Ford I think that there was an element of Jeff Flake kind of stepping up his game\nSt Louis I mean I I don't know how right now Lisa Murkowski Susan calls are going to go back and face any of their women voters on any level going into the midterms or anything else\nWhen you have to try to defend what the president did last night which is on the heels of the president saying that he thought I'm a Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness so\nThere's that element to this but Jeff Flake now kind of stepping up their game and sing with all of these questions with the stories that have\nBeen breaking about his drinking after after a judge Kavanaugh has sort of vehemently defended his drinking we don't know I can tell you if if he's had enough drinks to get blackout drunk we do know that there was a letter coming out today in the New York times from Nineteen eighty three\nIn which judge Kavanaugh refers to he and his buddies he and his friends who are all going to a beach week as obnoxious drunks with prolific ... among us now\nI don't know if that's enough to blackout drunk but in in my past opinion it would certainly do that in my past experience it would certainly do that but he also signed that letter with five apps which we've talked about in regards to what the testimony was and the word part\nRather than Brett and we also know bart oh Kevin ... was a character that one of his friends and put into a book Brett Kavanaugh was asked if that was based upon him he said he didn't know you'd have to ask the journal those are the writer well he signed this bar Kevin all we know that this is the judge Kevin wrote this letter wasn't somebody else so\nThere are questions that Jeff Flake just has about this guy that I think could sway his vote\nThis just hearing your last explanation just makes me wonder who's going to play all these people in the movie I\nCan't wait to see I mean I think right after that if you had Matt Damon from Saturday Night live playing right cabinet that would work and I think Brett Kavanaugh will be happy with that too\nRight so um I've probably ask you this before I'll ask you again\nWhat is this going to over one way or the other just one way or the other\nFeel I feel like and again we all know how these things shift right about her from day to day things could change I Would say I would expect by friday night for this give I think we head into the weekend having at least some idea of this thing being wrapped up whether or not we know it ... and I got the votes to become the next Supreme Court justice\nI don't know but I think we are certainly a step closer so I think\nWe starting next week not even caring about this any more moving on to something else\nAll right Michael ... thank you for your time today\nOn the Gulf Coast
