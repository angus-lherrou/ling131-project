power yet\nBut we can share\nWith you the latest here's the latest on all of this would Kavanaugh from Mike Emanuel\nOf Fox\nAfter an agreement to give the FBI one week to investigate allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh now Senate Democrats like Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut are demanding investigators should interviewed twenty three people\nAnything short of a full fair investigation will be a sham and straight jacket in this investigation is absolutely\nUnacceptable Republicans are holding to their deadline of friday to hear back from the FBI South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he's concerned about the treatment judge Kavanaugh has gotten from Democrats becoming the norm got health and\nPeople did this\nDon't worry about his temperament I worry about what they did\nOn Capitol Hill Mike Emanuel Fox\nWell to Michael power NBC News radio national correspondent Michael by our mourning\nMourning uncle Henry and I'm happy to see you happy to say say hello to Kelly good morning Kelly ... kitten morning too yeah\nSo so uh how big is this investigation going to be because I thought it was going to be a week long and then I heard that the president said the ... that they're going to expand the investigation\nYeah he said he he wants the expansion of the investigation because there had been the reports that perhaps it was a very limited investigation that there were only for people that the White House was asking the FBI to investigate so the president opening up yesterday which is kind of following up some tweets that he made saying that he wanted to have a full investigation and the ability to do that\nBut and this is sort of the caviar to it he wants it to be done as quickly as possible now what we know that Mitch McConnell has said he plans on having a vote by friday\nIf this indeed follows the guideline of the seven day investigation that the senators were asking for the Judiciary Committee then that would mean that there should wrap up\nBy friday of this week so whether or not we actually see that we'll see you have seen how things shift and change here within the context of this hearing and the investigation so it could take a little bit longer but at least at this point Mitch McConnell's planning on having a vote friday at some point I think that's probably written in pencil because that might be a little bit on the optimistic side but\nYou never know right now the FBI is currently conducting a thorough investigation they have have spoken to one person that according to Dr Ford was at the party with her and judge Kavanaugh when this incident happened that was legal and Kaiser so they spoke to legal in Kaiser on Saturday and then we saw the report yesterday of\nA former classmate of judge Kavanaugh was coming out saying that he was quite a drinker and that you would be belligerent and aggressive when he was drunk told a story to the FBI about how Kevin I got into a bar\nFight with I guess whoever the singer of you before he was\nA judge can watch this guy I Know I Know I wouldn't know what the guy looked like at all but judge Kavanaugh was apparently drinking thought this one person in the bar with the singer if you'd be forty when that person said no a fight broke out and a while judge cabinet did not get arrested\nIt was a friend of his it did get arrested in cat that I was interviewed by police so this is all something else the FBI is investigating right now\nSo you you'd be forty by the wife famous for red red wine\nRed red well I think that's the only song they're famous for frankly I'll go Henry\nYoung so you so you mentioned that this this is Penn children for a vote friday yeah\nMitch let me can I throw 'em or ran plays here we go\nSo far they've got this pencil then right and you know Mitch McConnell's got this date on his calendar ready to go but there was a story that broke last night from NBC News reporting\nAnd questioning now the timeframe the cabin on new about the Deborah ... assault allegation she's the one who said that he exposed himself or when they were in college at Yale and then when the White House do about it because according to NBC News they have screen shots of text messages\nFrom some of Brett Kavanaugh's friends in school they have all come about based upon it communication behind the scenes with these friends to try to refute claims\nAgainst Deborah merits and they say that this may have happened back in July but the problem here is that if you may recall cabinet told the Senate Judiciary committee under oath the first time you heard about remarriage his allegation was when the September twenty third article came out in the New Yorker\nThese text messages are dated and seemed to show going back into July that he was having conversations with friends trying to set up a story of a back story for himself\nBack in July so how long ago was it that he knew about these possible accusations and then how long did the White House know about it or did he keep them in the dark did they know about it and they kept quiet about it a lot of questions that the FBI who has the screen shots in their possession is going to have to investigate\nYou're listening to Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent so if there is a vote friday early next week do you think any votes will be changed by the FBI investigation\n[noise] I think if you believe\nSenator Jeff flake then he's got to have concern about the believability here of of cabinet because his concern was if there was anything that sort of brought up either that the he had been lying under oath or that there was some sort of perjuring himself into that that would certainly wiped clean\nAny consideration that he would have in regards to nominating a bright capital of the Supreme Court and I think that we use to Murkowski's falling in love with that she would like to see this whole investigation happened\nSo I think there's still the possibility that some of those could die off I think you could also see some of those red state Democrats be really concerned about tying themselves here five weeks out from mid term elections to somebody who may have been lying certainly had questions about whether or not they told the truth in their hearing so\nI think there's still a possibility that some of those votes could walk away from Kevin\nWe're at a time Michael ... thank you for your time and thank you for listening to Gulf Coast more than ...
