N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile [noise]\nNews headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent Michael by our good morning\nIt's MORNING to you know Glenn happy Monday and happy October first\nHappy October first to you too so is anybody going to be satisfied with this week long FBI investigation\nUncle Henry it's D.C who's satisfied with anything nobody ever satisfied with anything and everybody has to point fingers at everybody else except themselves I think that's where we sit here today where as of friday we know that the Senate Judiciary committee agreed to conduct in an FBI investigation or to how they continued\nConducting the SBA FBI investigation the background of Brett Kavanaugh which is technically what this is the president signed off on it so he's saying the president is that he's given the FBI free rein in this pro but Saturday the New York times reported that the White House has asked the FBI to only question for witnesses and that would\nCertainly seem as though that's a limitation on the type of FBI proved that can be happening here so then\nSunday you had a Dianne Feinstein wrote a letter to the White House demanding that they provide to the Senate Judiciary committee a copy of the written directive to the FBI to which the White House responded we haven't done anything all of the directives have come from\nYou guys in the Senate so we're standing here today not knowing anything more but that both parties seemingly on some level a happy with the scope of this investigation that is now under way\nI don't know if this is all about justice for Dr Ford or for Brett Kavanaugh and his family\nIt does seem like it's it's about making this last longer so I Would\nCertainly say I would certainly say that that's definitely spot on that as a very good point I mean you have not only a former FBI cheap James Comey who nobody wants to hear from but he's the former FBI Director has come out and said that there would be a lot of information that the FBI could find out about cabinet in a week's period of time\nBut he said that he doesn't believe this is about getting the truth out there because of the truth we're the only goal there'd be no time clock and the investigation wouldn't have been\nBrought to the table after the Senate Judiciary committee endorsed the nominee says that he thinks that this was about the Republican goal saying that there was an investigation and it didn't change their view and the Democratic goal saying that there was an investigation and they found incriminating evidence to the rail the nominee and that seems to be what this is all about well\nSo I see a couple of things that could happen and maybe you can come up with a few more but I think that uh they made in the investigation at the seven day mark and have a vote one way or the other and accept the results whether he goes through or not\nA or new accusations pop up around Thursday and ... and and then it becomes an open ended in ... FBI investigation or they withdraw the name\nYeah I I think I think any and all of those are possible like for instance we know that in the past twenty four hours as a former\nClassmate of Brett Kavanaugh's that's come out uh who is an assistant professor at North Carolina who says that are not only did Kevin I'll drink he was a frequent drinker he was a heavy drinker and when he did drink he would get aggressive and belligerent and that\nNow professor former classmate is done\nI swore written statement that he's taking to the FBI so technically this will be put if you follow procedure into Brett Kavanaugh's background\nFile which is what the FBI is continuing to investigate here now does that get any further questioning are they going to sit down with this former classmate try to get some information hard to tell at this point but\nIt does seem like you know we know for instance Kevin and Dr Ford neither one of them have been talked to by the FBI\nYet maybe it's because they have a a ton of testimony out there that the FBI would just use for the most part maybe come back with a couple of questions we know Deborah Ramirez the second accuser who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her she's been talked to by the FBI but Julie sweat Nick who was the third woman to come forward has not had any\nConversations with the FBI whatsoever so I think you're right I think there's a very good chance let's get to friday password to fight it let's say the seven days is up there is a very good chance you're going to see a lot of screaming and yelling and fighting about what\nDepth this investigation went to what they were able to find and you could still very well see vote move forward maybe this time next week on the seating of Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice\nSo I'm In we agree that the next ... if if there is a next nominee er during the Trump Administration can we agree that it'll be a woman\n[noise] it would seem as though that would be the next play right I mean that would seem as though that's the direction to go and I would think here\nAre based upon the me too movement that's not a bad political move to go in and certainly I mean I think at the end of the day the big question that most people had over the weekend or certainly a a big number of people had over the weekend is is Brett Kavanaugh the best selection is he the best opportunity\nFor a Supreme Court justice that anybody could bring to the table or is it worth investigating\nOther possibilities maybe there's somebody who would not have these kinds of a background concerns are issues and and perhaps\nIf you're looking at a female nominee I mean listen there's going to be scrutiny and I think that that scrutiny is going to be the certainly cranked up to ten or eleven and no matter who it's going to be uncle Henry\nBut perhaps if you can fit somebody through who doesn't have concerns in the background as much or if you've got any kind of a FBI investigation that sets up a background profile that would be the direction to go\nI guess we're looking for a nun with judicial experience\n[laughter] that's I think that would be the case yeah that would be the finite let's give it a thumbs up to everybody and\nBe able to pass on through I think that's what they do look Michael ... thank you for your time today you got to have a great rest of your morning
