M.\nOr the average age is four years old\nAnd Ninety percent of the cases I have been found and those Eighteen years old and younger the other part of it is that right now they have no idea what is causing this and it has shown up basically nationwide while I said they're not a huge number of cases right now or they're looking at a hundred twenty seven cases across the country\nIt goes from New Jersey to\nUh California to Alabama where they have some cases that are under investigation there they suspect are related to this so uh it it really is a cause for concern because right now they say it could be a virus could be an environmental toxin\nCould be mosquito borne could be something that has a genetic component to it so they are investigating and in the meantime there are some children\nWho are suffering through this which includes a weakness a muscle weakness and the impossible paralysis in some children\nWell it's a any anything that affects a four year old really of course huge scare for parents\nYeah ... and that's what's really leading to this warning from the CDC they are now saying that uh if you see your child develop a southern weakness in the arms and legs or maybe a grouping of the facial features of seek immediate medical care\nOr even though there is no treatment for this at the time being they can start a physical therapy protocols that might be able to minimize some of the effects which range or some children recover rather quickly from this others' experience continued paralysis and require ongoing physical therapy\nSo when did this when did this pop up is this relatively new or is this been developing over the last few months\nWell actually it hasn't been on the radar for some years now the first cases were\nDetected back in two thousand twelve the CDC's started tracking it in Tony fourteen uh and it's interesting because it seems to focus on late summer and fall that's when it's found and every two years it seems to spike I mean twenty fourteen\nYet arrives in cases twenty sixteen you had a rise in cases and here we are twenty Eighteen or the right now they say since twenty fourteen\nThey have been documented about four hundred cases like I said it's not\nThe numbers are huge a but just the fact that it it targets children and can be debilitating is very concerning\nBecause we don't know what is causing it there's no advice on any preventative measures right you're just supposed to you're just supposed to monitor your kids and and see if they show symptoms\nYeah all they can say right now all go Henry is that you should treat this like you would treat colds and the flu a first of all get all your vaccinations this is not connected to any type of vaccination\nA number to frequent hand washing and if you're in an area where there are mosquitoes you should have mosquito protection either repellent or a be covered up in those situations because at this point they're not sure whether it is\nMosquito borne or not\nA bill for any other country dealing with is\nYeah there there it has been reported in some countries in Asia and also in Australia uh so it's not exclusive to the United states and again this is uh something\nThat leads to more of a mystery I it right now they're just really not sure exactly what causes this and and uh there are a number of theories about it but still they're continuing to work on it and and you know the these cases continue to pop up\nWell All right well a bill ... a thank you for your time You're welcome\nTheir egos bills are for ABC News radio national correspondent Kelly been a just a a what a frightening thing if you're a parent and your kid develops something like this that no one even knows what it is\nYeah and in these cases where the diseases so rare it's not something a doctor would typically look for so I Would imagine it's even harder to diagnose\nIf it does happen and that\nWow I Hope they come up with that has some answers soon on what's causing absolutely\nAnd or we're almost out of time in this segment or want to mention that if you want to see\nWhat goes on behind the scenes and hear the conversations we have during our commercial breaks
