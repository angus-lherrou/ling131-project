B. B. in Biloxi\nAnd our news radio some tangible UNT I'm a Ninety nine find them to drag immobile we have news headlines\nComing up in about ten minutes before we get there we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael ... news radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly happy to say to you both\nThank you so so what has happened since we last talked to you yesterday about this ... this uh because there's something every day on this this journalist story\nI Do feel like there was also part of that where you it sounded like it was a soap opera start since we last left you yeah um yeah yeah I mean we\nLiterally the place where there were some announcements yesterday by Turkish politician that can show his body was found in a well\nNear the Saudi constantly ... and then we were going to hear today president early on in front of parliament there in Turkey describe the naked truth what happened in great detail in regards to the death of ...\nOnly we didn't get that from early on today we didn't get that you just really added new rhetoric to the scandal he did accuse the Saudi Government a premeditated political murder\nBut did he offer any evidence to that or anything else in regards to the death of the show he no he offered a timeline that was one\nLittle bit of a piece of the story that I hadn't heard before that I thought was interesting which is where he said the uh the Fifteen member group that flew over from Saudi Arabia that especially killed ... according to what\nThe Turkish officials have found a portion of that group on October second went into removed the hard disks of the security cameras from within the consulate but aside from that there was no other evidence was and again that wasn't evidence offered up that's just a statement by president Earl on so we didn't really hear anything except for sort of threats and\nHis call on Saudi Arabia to if they can indeed arrest these Fifteen people who committed the murder and his temple that they would be tried in as step on some level\nAside from that there was no facts that was the audio tape there was no DNA evidence and there certainly was it a production of here is the bone saw that was used to this member of the body of ...\nSo what is what is the official story as of today from Saudi Arabia now are they claiming that they're looking into it too or or what\nCorrect yeah they they say that they are investigating there's an ongoing investigation as well last we heard from Saudi Arabia they admitted that there was a murder of ... inside the consulate that it was uh\nIt it for their view that it was a fight that had gone wrong at a fistfight had killed ... but\nFrom there all they could tell us what the fist by killed him and then the people inside the consulate who actually did the killing went rogue on some level and apparently the Saudis are looking for those individuals as suspects in the murder of Jamal show they\nApparently got the information that it was a fist fight and then no idea where the body is aren't able to track down the people that were in the room there even though on more than one occasion according to Turkish investigators they have identified a few of the people that were in that room a there was even a report\nIn the past twenty four hours that there was a broadcast from with inside the ... to the consulate\nFrom one of print Solomon's close aides or south al ... who is apparently somebody who's close with the crown prince and also via Skype threatened\nA cause she'll be right there in the ... so they had a broadcast of his phone call via Skype or where he was threatening to show he had at one point in time told the henchmen there were in that room to bring me the head of the dog um so now again\nNone of that offered via proof if that was all on audiotape or where they were getting that information Turkish officials none of that was offered up to parliament nor to the world today when he spoke to part of the president or to on a system that he has all this information that we do know that the our CIA director has gone overseas for the FBI Gina Haspel is there a\nWe were told that she was going to monitor the situation I'm guessing she's tried to get in there and get as much in an information she can or from the investigation to bring back to President Trump\nSo we're we're still artificial line is that we're still looking into it I guess is that it\nWe're still way I guess technically I mean it's not our investigation so we're literally waiting on the two parties involved here were waiting on turkey to complete their investigation which let's be fair they have not located a body yet and that\nThat was a call made by a president or to one today as well asking for Saudi Arabia to let them know who within the confines of turkey\nWas responsible for helping them get rid of the body and the Saudi officials who are saying that there are still try to track down these people that went rogue and that uh went off the grid if you will and and killing the show and they're trying to track those people down the suspect so until that's kind of wrapped up we're just at the behest of their investigations and getting as much information as we can\nMichael power um and I don't know if you can answer this question or not but I'm I don't know a lot about turkey and Saudi Arabia and their relationship um should we completely trust turkey and all of this uh or or do they have an an chicken antagonistic relationship with Saudi Arabia\nThey there there's very much antagonism even to this point let me just highlighted by saying this that\nThat I'm a hurdle on having his announcement today in front of parliament was happening at\nThe exact same time that the crown prince was opening his financial seminar out to the conference there in Saudi Arabia he was doing\nIt purposefully to draw attention away from Saudi Arabia and the crown prince and his big conference of all of these big business people that were going to be in Saudi Arabia that the U.S backed up and I believe that the other countries are so backed off of\nA he did it the exact same how to draw attention away from that and towards himself so uh this\nIs not a great relationship between the two I don't\nThink turkey wants to go out of their way to create a bad relationship and sort of falsified misinformation but\nI Do think that there is a sort of a combative element between the two especially when you've got this new reign of the crown prince trying to be I guess less less Muslim friendly more Arab friendly and you've got the the Muslim world of the Turks are trying to stand their ground\nMichael by we're at a time thank you for your time today you guys have a great rest of
