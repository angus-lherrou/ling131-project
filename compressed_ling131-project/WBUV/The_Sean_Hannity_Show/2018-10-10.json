landfall with one hundred fifty five miles per hour when very close to a category five so powerful it could hit Georgia as a hurricane\nThat one of those ones that hit in immediately just completely falls apart this can be a hurricane all the way that the overnight outer socks\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect to that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline kept five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\nOr over a million power outages we expect occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is gonna be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if\nOr in if you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst\nThe worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person in May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me\nHe is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nThey don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talked about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find some warrants that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there's no there are there but anyway then they start to leave the media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing too is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's our sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ...\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days\nIs we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she was really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Bill Nelson needs to be defeated by Rick Scott who I Love in Florida but Rick Scott can't be campaigning now taking care of

to middle Georgia oh they're very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning mirror Augusta tomorrow morning and near and felt that the track for instance uh looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are

night\nUh will take it or to take it probably\nNorth of Fayetteville North Carolina and then two AM in the morning it reaches the uh reaches a lizard at city North Carolina and then it goes out\nSo that's how we're expecting this to move or over the next twenty four to thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me know there's a little bit more first of all I mean the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody stayed than people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case\nMean I'm looking at some of these images and it's

talk about ... ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know a signed up for David to get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal buys an application in the case of quarter page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Cole me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more uh as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be it\nIn this House Judiciary committee interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a ... D O D J vu on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nEver to hit our country is built very rapidly\nVery quickly Michael also expected to hit Georgia with hurricane force winds and bringing heavy rains through the Carolinas which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence\n\n... for nine time saver traffic from the window king usa dot com traffic center\nAnd we have just a month or delays in Gulfport north on board and I went to an airport wrote a no deal southbound voted on his low which we know deal and I tend to both sides of highway Ninety in ocean springs moving slowly between Washington avenue and the ocean springs road\n... ... calls at eight eight eight three one one eight seven to three about let me be used talk\nOne oh four nine wetter [noise] here's your actually weather forecasts Michael has made landfall it will continue to move away from the area well she was diminishing said I still see some political flooding at the time of high tide well below sixty\nSix humidity will drop weight to light and then we'll feel that nice little community to more of the high eighty seven degrees clear comfortable debartolo fifty five friday eighty to get with low humidity for accuweather a meteorologist ape Samuel\n\nMrs network in massive sell off on Wall street stocks\nPlummeting as investors are still by rising interest rates\nAnd worries about corporate earnings slowing down among the biggest decline there's today ... which have been some of the biggest winners over the past twelve months without closing down an eight hundred and thirty two points the NASDAQ down three hundred and sixteen\nAnd they asked him he might hundred down five days in a row down Ninety five points and Sears Holdings is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and his hiring in three partners to how they prepare for a bankruptcy filing is the cash strapped company that wants to dominated\nAmerican retailing faces a debt payment deadlines here's has one hundred and thirty four million dollars in debt do one Monday Eddie Lambert hedge fund manager who he is chair and yell at Marja shareholder and biggest creditor could read through the company and the incentive to pass by making the pain when the Fox business reports on your three Barsky\n\nFor a beautiful new custom built modular home that's more affordable than traditional construction Segal\nWord home center not only are there homes more affordable but they also take less time to build and are completely comes to mind symbol milk to local codes they have a residential looking quality our energy efficient and they appreciate in value porches and car\nParts are available as well as Seinfeld financing don't toward home center is on highway forty nine just south of here in central and on Facebook at Gulfport home center [noise]\nHey I have to fight for your voice on the fire have everything more casual buffet\nAnd pray for that family or for a formal get together like a five to ... all types of contact our medicine for health care that came about by you know five ...\nWake up with me Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on Gulf Coast morning we have six to eight on news talk one born nine ... [noise] and\n\nWe can get you a\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office and chairman Goodlatte ... office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of coal me the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's\nPhone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that\nAre truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be in\nDiamond on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein side have either have you seen that particular buys her application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see the notes that taken after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with yep yeah I remember Mr ... told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris deal he would then contact ... percent yup yup and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adults\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe ... all those documents as well\nThat would include the McCain number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more importantly the American pie\nOr do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but\nI think with all that's going on and they should\nDemand that he testify under oath a thank you so much congressman

unleashed a Brady the down dropped more than eight hundred points mainly fueled by rising interest rates the NASDAQ plunging more than four percent its biggest point drop in Eighteen years\nI'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I listen to the old tactics\nWith the Republican Party but you're intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work at a back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAnd I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks um\nAnd you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nShow I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLooked the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans\nNone of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this isn't the jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee hold the rapists Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet if you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible offer Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are
