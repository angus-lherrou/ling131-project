didn't do that\nYeah Pete an aunt\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did ah when you're Regis leaves wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and it someplace sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused and to condemn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say\nYou got a ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially label she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer in the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no face\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit ah in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the interview which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we don't believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick\n... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term hits the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats\nPhiladelphia reportedly

NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statements you release just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up\nOutside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen

individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done

be in two minds\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad [noise] but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think when it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just was nothing to this story\nI'm an when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done it damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker all the New York times couldn't print the story and and they

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of this agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware a light Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and faith has changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your\nColleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and up yeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator Hirono now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation\nInto the quote I throwing report\nYeah yeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted ... she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we'll write those to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delayed legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain well\nI mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... Ford's claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're listening to I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nOr less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they\nThey have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all but\nThey have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or urban you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage the homophobic Xena phobias Lama fold you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's going to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff is as predictable as the day is long\nAnd now being court nominees this slander has been taken to a whole new level you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous [laughter]\nThis is clearly an effort to destroy the reputation of my own and harnessing\nExpects Democrats to push for further delay we hope\nThat the FBI investigation is full Senate\nDemocratic leader Chuck Schumer questioning the scope of the investigation also saying he believes the FBI report should be made public when it's done the president defending his nominee again today but also expressing confidence in the investigation boxes John decker live at the White House\nPresident Trump said the FBI is working very hard on its investigation into sexual assault and misconduct allegations that have been made against judge capital and he said he continues to support his Supreme Court nominee\nI think that judge ... pretty well to me over the last twenty four hours\nA lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI in terms of their [noise] their sales numbers have to go with\nDemocrats questioning the truthfulness of Kevin O's sworn testimony the president said lying to Congress by anybody is in his words unacceptable Lisa\nJohn President Trump and his siblings accused of tax schemes and in New York Times report claiming that in the Nineteen nineties they boosted month they received from their parents through fraud and tax evasion a lawyer for the president Charles Harder cause the allegations one hundred percent false\nHighly defamatory and based on extremely inaccurate information harder also says all state matters were held by attorneys accountants and other Trump family members with virtually no involvement\nBy the president [noise] boxing there [noise]\nThis is talk went on for now I\n... have guns stolen in Tennessee are recovered near Chicago\nThe guns were stolen from UPS facility in Memphis on Sunday according to the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\nA spokesman says the estimated four hundred weapons taken made this one of the biggest single gun fast to be investigated by the agency to men were suspected in the case but only one in on identified Eighteen year old is in custody\nATF Chicago tweeted better reward of up to five thousand dollars is being offered for information on the whereabouts of the second suspect and anyone else who may be connected to the crime\nUPS says it is helping with the investigation colonel Scott Fox news\nReassurance from Facebook at a recent security breach said expose the personal information is I'm fifty million users the company now says investigators have determined that hackers did not access other third party sites that use Facebook single logging system there's still no indication that any use your information has been misused\nTo breach has been fixed the investigation continues and object in the far reaches of our solar system first discovered in twenty Fifteen maybe a dwarf planet or even a Full Planet\nThe object is catalogued as T.
