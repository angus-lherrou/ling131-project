that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals' organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe but everyone all eight point six million

as for anything new works on as information about any of the instruments this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make George our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city and want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about for reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind that nothing we do in law enforced\nWe do alone for a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals who agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and I can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nLyrics cities intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second and on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're

not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they said no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president than making these\nChanges are as you know showing last march I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck branded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling\nPackaging whatever the case may be\nUm and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left in they'd send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that was going to speak about specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name um but then he got on and\nHe went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chased me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what an opposite enough already listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh\nThis is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh the the ... that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka none gee nobody ever it's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House um it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president\nAnd those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives and you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now\nGoing back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress somebody's gonna get hurt somebody's gonna get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible you can't fake news they are fake news\nNo they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left of who it is CNN anybody tell me which Republican which member of either the media\nAll the political leadership made political profit\nFrom a Bernie solve is willing to shooting Steve ... Steve ... which Republican member of the the pop the all the media profit to\nPersonally profit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director hat all all had rice and mailed to them by the way I've had white powder mailed to me\n... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch him several responsible here uh but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what what does it matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to run tyrants today blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these tempted letter bombs why is that okay when the ... Republican profited from congressmen actually\nGetting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am standing out by left wing activist\nThis is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going through ... down to get Republicans on November to six because they had enough of the lives of the double standards\nYou know it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that you know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known your so long I Know that's who you are\nAnd it comes so second nature to you you don't

maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more

dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nI spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun\nWe were the office that took the lead nationally so go against the Obama power plant\nOne that very big victory at the U.S

the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have
