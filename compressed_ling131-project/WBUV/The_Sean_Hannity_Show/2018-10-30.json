Fox News that's how some opponents describe what President Trump is considering an executive order to end the citizenship policy it's based on the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nA congressional candidates in very important districts it's interesting all up there are four hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's a vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate\nGain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman analyze your Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold tier\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think anyone I warn you of what they do every\nDoing for years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read\nThese results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else I remember my first break it at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read\nThat John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seats difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you could check it out for yourself and the only thing\nThat can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think is going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over\nTrump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping\nThe Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with no earlier\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only are they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have been set up because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is a white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen known very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate\nThe president arguing it helps fuel illegal immigration including some of the migrants heading up from Central America now\nThere but a lot of meetings here at the White House over the last week about this caravan and how to address it\nOne of the ideas it's being kicked her out is this idea of ending birthright citizenship so that anybody who came into the country illegally and had a baby here would not be able to claim American citizenship for that baby this was a big issue and you'll remember\nIn the twenties sixteen campaign the president talking about so called quote anchor baby noxious\nJohn Roberts House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says the president doesn't have the power

FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty six team that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so I don't think I don't know what I'm saying in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton\nAndrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by those\nBut I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel\nFought back against the Moffett fats in may a Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response and\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be the funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully and the history of the world that our military needs to be cut\nThey if they favor of replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so key sign their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during\nA thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel or I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from left wing billionaire as like a George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help them\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point you know\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a family arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and the force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity\nTo really capitalize on that went on governor buddy of Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate and the southeast and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on while biting Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back you\nAlso support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background like it looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate um they do not like the scrutinize his record\nUh the fact that those documents dad release after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day he\nHas been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election but this loners they're home\nThey're doing a lot of everything from mobile voting sites to\nA combination traps and the ballot you know the bad news is that you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend\nA which we weren't sure if that happened that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so are they are resilient people are in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah look I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take off were request off I Will say though um had that gone forty miles west of population would have been much bigger\nI'm so there is damage and its extensive damage but I think in damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple areas that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base\nAnd I feel like we're all family and was showing\nAnguish that's going on\nSome friend she was part of a long line outside the tree of life synagogue where

district [noise] ah that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nAnd what are your homes I think the ... what was in the

they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they
