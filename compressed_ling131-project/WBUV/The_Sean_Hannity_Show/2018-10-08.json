I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of all and the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the\nTime ... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't\nFear that that in any way you're going to be charged\nDrank absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah it's basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment\nOf ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lives about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the road block that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing and it goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know some things a lot of serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ...

I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with what's with this ah the OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come the fall or\nCan't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look it over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody what happened in twenty sixteen now every other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign uh services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "08"}
