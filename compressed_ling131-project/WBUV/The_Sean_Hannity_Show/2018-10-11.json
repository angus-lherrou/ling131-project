then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of

by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do

the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea\nYou know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that

question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress's question when called his answer that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... ... actually a account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he should be in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it ... you're supposed to come in at ... or the your theory maybe he's the\nGuy who even run the Justice Department and understand the timeline on may ninth Kobe is fired based on the Rosenstein memo on basic faith is when he has this conversation with these the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... and of course may seventeenth is when Bob ... was named special counsel constantly in San ... what else happened on his ...\nThat's the day moment when the ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and then we'll get signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we wanted his all we wanted to bring him in and ask questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this well first of all how has your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district\nTo get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on the pilot the yet the healthcare immigration taxes are my opponent is a clerk you liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you say they're pouring billions and because\nThey know they're going after you and ... big time and and you're right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is ah my opponent the resist\nI she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out in the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court ... captain and Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the er the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan\nYou know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there was an if people want the full list that we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com good\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that ... their congressmen or a woman who was in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman tried\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply capitalistic when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never a great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who support the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you talking about the ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary and the ISIS\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nI mean the list is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced economy going a four point two percent lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage come open Ross Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do those things can make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a national election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understands that he's out campaigning on the good thing that happened with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all men on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or\nOr both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you mean by that uh they brought\nYou know I'll just go back to the way your frame that you only got ... dot com it's all like ... Iran over its like at the specific but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people because we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason\nAnd now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and ... when he just sat in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and all that Jim go on with the so\nOn ... ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her\nSo that should have disqualified him Rosenstein is right about that but in the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why companies should be fired one of the things mowers looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of ...\nAligns could not adjust valves to reduce the pressure that set off warning alarms and led to the explosions and fires that investigators say damaged one hundred thirty one structures nice source parent company of Columbia gas issued a statement saying they are fully cooperating with the ongoing probe\nAnd it's the suspended similar work on both pressure systems in light of the incident grown all Scott Fox News'\nMartha and the Russians agency are investigating what went wrong with the launch early today\nThe two man cruel but Russian space craft including an American and to make an emergency landing today after the second stage of its rocket booster failed to lift off\nUs astronaut Nikkei again Russian costs but not ... and landed safely and without harm after their capsule separated from the poster and took a steep ballistic dissent with parish shoes and the steps of Catholics than\nIt was hangs first attempt to get into space he was going to be talking with the international space station for stay on the orbiting craft Russian space program that's been played recently with technical problems in London Greg talk on Fox News\nRecapping to sell off for another day on Wall street the gala drops five hundred forty five points at one point it was down more nearly seven hundred dropping under twenty five ... finishes right around twenty five thousand fifty two gallon over to ... percent no\nCrude oil sliding over three percent the S. and P. and the NASDAQ also selling off\n[noise]\nYou know for nine time saver track from the law firm of Alexander ... associates traffic center\nAnd we knew that it acted on north bound Washington in ocean springs and I tend to east or is now cleared\nAnd that a stalled vehicle that was on the ... river bridge causes backup has now been moved out of the way so we still have the big accident that has all the lanes blocked on east bound ten ... sixty one should be very careful to there and I'm Ellen daily\nNews talk went on for nine years Iraqi weather forecast fall has a right there will be clear and cool tonight below a fifty six mostly studied tomorrow humidity's eighty one degrees closely clear comfortable\nAgain tomorrow night with although near sixty than Saturday looks good plenty of sunshine you're high temperature eighty three degrees I'm accuweather meteorologists have Samuel\n[noise] this is Henry From Gulf Coast morning with Kelly man and one is one of four nine W.

and intimidating the politicians and ah then speakers when they're out eating\nWhat you're seeing is an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like

hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will
