but\nBecause she'll get did work for the Washington Post a vanished after visiting the consulate he had lived in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate this I'm only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper\nIf you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia beat quiet anyway

James O'Keefe\nYou know you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order is Scott and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much have shown for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now exposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda lie campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is to lie to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show no ah this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in Missouri\nOne of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these\nAre staffers throughout her office hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money through ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when the Democratic party abandon any sense of\nDue process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all\nAnd when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these ... middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said the number of quoted she says well starting with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... billion betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were their own their own or something\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump and she didn't tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's very words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you now what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release the candidate of the time we have to United States senators and their candidates\nOpposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the Olympic ... tactics against the landscapes the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week and it's very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the old bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotapes not my words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot a lot of people watch it to themselves and they can decide people pretty smart hum a James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very tossed dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and they'll reticent and his staff and he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one showing a toll free telephone number will make a quick stop\nA there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and or does that that that race now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred nine four one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nPartying and investigating the stories that matter to you\nKnow [noise]\nIn during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school she was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in her professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know ... it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that uh the people in Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nAnd showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran into\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh it can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association is never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "17"}
