now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they are willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab rush loser but boy when it comes\nGetting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the center of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support the only Muslim use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nHe's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett us that and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bread I said is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs\nWe pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront of the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom Perez was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nBut Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday and an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right and you've got to force the hip hop\nSo we got the cabinet issue you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nYou've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nWere more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nTo the same for billboards up and we brought them all in highlands I talked to some of the women up their role coffee and beans and they go listen to the message but when you look at the United states we talk or relatives we know what's happening and many of the women and children obviously being released from our shelters boxes\nWilliam ... is with the caravan near Mexico's border with Guatemala both the president and his predecessor are likely to bring up immigration campaign rallies today for mid term candidate success Jessica Rosenthal with more live\nAt least the President Obama's been on the campaign trail since early September hitting sponsors competitive house races like Southern California in Philadelphia and later this week he'll have to Wisconsin but today he's speaking in Las Vegas where there is an incredibly tight race for Senate between the incumbent Republican Dean Heller and the Democrats Jacky Rosen\nPresident Trump was in ... during his term campaign swing to the west is weekend Republican\nVictory [noise] will send a message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens\nAnd President Trump is not done campaigning either tonight he's helping out former presidential rival Ted Cruz with the south and Houston Lisa\nThanks Jessica I mean time on his way to Texas President Trump just telling reporters\nHis administration plans but he's calling a resolution on at ten percent middle class tax cut it's not clear yet exactly\nWhat that would mean an hour to the clothes on Wall street thanks as well as they had been earlier right now the Dow is down fifty eight points back over twenty five thousand three hundred the NASDAQ has been higher the S. and P. lower\nThis is functioning [noise]\nThis is talk went on for now and\nThe U.S and Russia exchanging threats over in Nineteen eighty seven arms treaty the U.S has long accused Russia of cheating on it and President Trump is also concerned about China not being a part of it given Beijing's buildup of weapons and manmade islands in the south China Sea so he's not threatening to pull out of that nuclear treaty\nPresident Putin's spokesman releasing a statement\nHe says in part we strongly disagree that Russia violates the NFC that said intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nRussia has always been complying with the treaty and we believe that the intention to withdraw from the treaty is of course causing concern because such steps in case they are taking in reality will make the world more dangerous\nConscious Kevin cork at the White House after meeting today in Moscow as national security adviser John Bolton one top Russian security officials saying they are willing to try to address us concerns but also threatening to respond in kind if the U.

National Guard in order to make sure this\nIs what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws in sovereignty and a president that are saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um no I I think Democrats are like in the back of their heads hoping this happens so oh maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I'm not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI'm In I'm sick of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these things that's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to come from either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through those are the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Henry Kissinger was shouted down and listen to some of this [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThen I got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the ...\nYou know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you you clear the crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country you know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how not have a decent people are supposed to behave in and it is you know where the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis could send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNot is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the ideas you'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left this is a new cars finishes the way ... liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy\nThat's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nNot going to let me ask you this when this great nation off or how\nDoes the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is gonna pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they are hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safe is for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president doesn't want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced to Democrats once a quarter 'cause I think deep down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them have their ... their case a Jew Decatur till we can find out or they legitimate\nBe they have not adhere to the spirit of that agreement or to the agreement itself Russia China's not included in

president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I wrote it up on Long Island in the summer\nEnough that insect light well the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's name was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay\nMe too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one and Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump\nTwitter insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and uh the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the ... of President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this if he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic as they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that he or she says all it is is he he's recognizing with a legendary Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response so\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic and elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more jobs out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society shot the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because it's the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the
