mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all this as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose a very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody uh the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story that news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular ...\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the ... is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's cuts and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out\nLinking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with the dishes racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nAny person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate is that a bomb a nation what climate is he a way to sort of press releases about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume or day uh terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a brand she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter those things that are a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expecting\nAll the way that I Would have or she would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him he tell us and joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nMurder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination of you were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three eerie ear work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nFrom listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now it's not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group\nI'm a very progressive cheese and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have everything with David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscured Peter Beinart as a matter of that group that's in Israel faster and Haider from start to finish\nRecorded then George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that report to speak to this one for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people that want to politicize anything and the president by the way can't win for losing\nThe guy who sent those pipe bombs around\nUh people claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh have President Trump he called them a global list there's no longer insulting work world\nConservatives by and large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a who Brock and and Shimon Peres a and others\nThat frog you broadcast from Israel you've been a great friend of Israel but ... percent right and on for a look there been articles lately there's an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is a it frankly Israel haters and not give a past this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene Palestinians and the ... it's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWhat words matter but this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will see their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw a friend said show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe a little bit of sag along your jaw line um remember ... when he gets rid of bags and\nService being held just a few hours after the accused gunman Robert powers made his first court appearance in a wheelchair released from the hospital earlier today ours\nWas in court in hospital issue garb you seem to work at a clear mind answering yes or no when asked questions why the judge Bowers acknowledge that he received a copy of the criminal complaint filed against him by an FBI agent in that criminal complaint reveals disturbing details about the synagogue

attacks like criticism of the president for the attack success John decker my that the White House\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders pushing back it claims by some Democrats at the president has blamed the media for the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nVery first thing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nEarlier the president tweeting the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an

governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin all and that is going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers per brightest in calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the

Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in mid term elections\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I looked at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this is really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature

have spoken at all about the caravan their silence has been definite then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and Xena phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks so you\nKnow seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida or we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but\nYeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for better future for all of our citizens stay positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I

and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland secure\nEarly have made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner a and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column both my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the ... actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and that with the Venezuelan\nAnd lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing a posted videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a\nBorder wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not seem to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm about ready to lose I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a present shall we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to get them\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico
