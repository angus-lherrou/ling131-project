targeting high profile Democrats including former president Barack Obama\nPackages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse you got to clear the holes you can't let these\n... you know getting in the faces bidding and Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the\nTable to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a nationalist\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not\nGoing to end well somebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious packages center Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face\nHolder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um\nYou know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security\nIn my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you\nKnow remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax\nThat was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about\nMe today but I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that but it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with\nReports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do\nIt's a scary story but if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice\nAnd letters were actually sent to President Trump defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened\nHere and then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting when Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism\nIt was amazing but you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction to this\nIs so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan\nIt just they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter said that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nAfter a string of suspicious packages mainly targeting high profile Democrats including former president bronco Obama\nExtremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of\nThe President Trump moments ago saying the country has to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] he spoke at a previously\nPlanned event and just after a briefing from the FBI Justice Department and homeland security the packages found today come two days after I device was found outside the state of billionaire Democrat donor George Soros in suburban New York boxes girl Scott has more live\nAt least so far three potentially explosive devices have drawn attention in New York there is one the that was bound for the residents of bill and Hillary Clinton ... an apparent device that the New York CNN studios another new\nYork governor Andrew Cuomo do tell us during a news conference earlier a\nDevice has been sent to my office\nOr when you're\nThat divide is also being hand we've since learned in the last few minutes that device who's been clear but the Clinton and CNN packages are still being looked at as a terrorist act which\nThanks colonel meantime the number of packages has continued to grow with the latest founded a mail screening facility in Maryland was addressed to another democratic lawmakers California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nA package also still being investigated at the Florida office of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz none of this housing and already anxious Wall Street\nThe downs down to sixty eight [noise]\nThis is talk went on for nine [noise] free Catholic\nOur top story at least six suspicious packages remain under investigation if you include the device sent a billionaire George Soros on Monday there have been no explosions and no injuries most of the devices in New York targeting top Democrats\nShe brings debate and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and for elected leader\nWho in many ways set the tone\nIs especially important\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo urging New Yorkers to go about their business undaunted by what she and the New York mayor or calling terrorist acts first lady Melania Trump alongside the president moments ago he\nCannot tolerate those scholarly attack and I strongly condemn or who to violence that white\nHouse event was a bill signing and the ongoing fight against opioid abuse and measure aimed in part and helping to stop the flow of illicit drugs being sent through the mail something to look forward to getting to the world series tonight\nIn the eight times the Boston Red Sox have won the world series they took home to victory in game one on six of those occasions\nIncluding the

Dakota\nLiterally yet she's quote she'll be super liberal every elected\nThat's what they're caught saying on tape\nYou know she's she'd be bolder if she's reelected and everything I'll just like reticent in Tennessee just like Claire McCaskill of Missouri I only got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people in the states\nI'm you know it's a one of the things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have\nThe the what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nKnow that if this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and\nI frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case I'm there\nIt's an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we\nWatch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nAnd they've been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through um what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incidents so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nAnd now the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act I strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority so the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expanse in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC\nNews reporter named Ben Collins oh Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a

[noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices said and they got that without detonating that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie\nWell listen when you get NATO to stuff but you know you blow to pieces gets harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send to a ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps do writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know watched on tons of different times of different technologies get sprint know mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages loose who's a distance of benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to Democrats and it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be\nOff the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some radical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now no and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices are now we don't want to get a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period hole stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop\nA new kind of a ... let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this they're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this\nSo it's got to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes showing that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you can figure out that John Brennan and then you know it'd be the comet he's not a CNN country this is just basic stuff I mean I think about it if you were a enough of its Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen you got ... just in New York city there were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time a\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could have been Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based again I haven't obviously have an adult size these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as the foremost someone either\nDidn't know what they were doing in March sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God war\nThey somehow want it to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin which you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre ah this whole cases very bizarre even look John even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized hyping the pictures the media is put out about these devices I mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commissioner who has some experience in the space\nBook this packages suspicion here's this big oversized hyping it\nSomething out about this\nWhere we're at orange commission and where where would you where would you start\nWell this this one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is uh what if it's a hoax when it's not one of these devices that will what if they're not real at all in this person lunatic to wherever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate\nA lot as a good possibility given uh what what Dan saying the the amateur hour a look of the packages or I Would uh you know I'd be skeptical and uh I'd wait on the uh the outcome of the ...\nAnd the uh the the people to see what they find in the devices themselves\nSo we really saying is what we should do in all cases it never rush to judgment that's what you're saying and I agree with you\nOn these times we have to unify we have to come together\nThese as an unmistakable message should be sent that any attacks or threats of political violence have no place in America one of the packages were sent to the CNN office in midtown Manhattan Fox has gone off Scott has more live\nAt least a from Matt package at CNN to others in D.C Maryland and California these parcels that put local state and federal officials on high alert NYPD deputy commissioner for counter terrorism John Miller says the investigative conversations are ongoing\nAbout other incidents that are unfolding and other places but suffice it to say it appears that an individual or individual center multiple similar packages\nThe NYPD is not talking about any names on return addresses so far six packages are still being investigated three others have been cleared as potential threats ...\nAnother package was found at a congresswoman office in South Florida our Fox's and brown is live\nAt least to the Broward County Florida bomb squad has been here at the building that host Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office here in sunrise all afternoon all because of possible bomb arrived here and we're told the device was not addressed to the congresswoman a former attorney general Eric Holder\nBut the sender got his address wrong and used Wasserman Schultz has office as the return address\nNow about forty minutes east of here an Avon tour of the city office building there was evacuated because a suspicious package address to the Congress woman's office in that building arrived but police say they're only acting out of caution Lisa\nBanks and then sell off on Wall street down down over six

now number three rather send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected what's\nSo amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn an Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's got to be so liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it and I just have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a good choice\nIt's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in\nMissouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead\nThe voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nHumbling I'm Lisa Brady recap on Wall street in a moment
