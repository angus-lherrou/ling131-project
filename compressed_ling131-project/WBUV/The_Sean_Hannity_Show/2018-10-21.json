[noise] this is talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\n[noise]\nStanding by their story I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News Saudi Arabia maintains journalist Jamal ... death was not a targeted killing but lawmakers don't believe that Fox's gr now Scott has more live from Steve\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley the three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we do that now for a long time and we know that for Pfizer court judges or ...\nEnded information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get\nTo the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason shape it's is with us former congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank\nYou both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is for the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nWas going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nAnd it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them to uh get in to the Congress to take this ad and I don't care if they're not ...\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena usa peanut first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh my God he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it they say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr Elias Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress hasn't and clear issue any subpoenas ... we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas in fact conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those conversations they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media league strategy that they discussed it this way Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they did\nIt themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which\nOne could be ... begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district call me as relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if\nThey would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again hold

minutes runs a physician doctor\nSalah ... listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive in New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team\nOf Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denies it says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister\nYou have to re rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation might bump pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts the day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged pit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president saying they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that could ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats and I've been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr\nSebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending\nThe feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hopping Fox News contributors thirty year CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was cork in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national rent them and it was a common pay he wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of living that day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the cost of ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly just remembering ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer that President I think was a hundred percent right to just bash the secretary state\nThey gather the fact emphasize that they were a issue of greatest concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they needed a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary problems hey was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against Iranian had you had many in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that\nWould cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay what cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that um I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the ... the um over the perfect on on the truth is short we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B as to bomb it's been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\nWar I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we know knowing that gays and lesbians were killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort can I can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood President Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in future who worked in the front row\nOf that event fitting that show the environment five year Obama White house the Muslim Brotherhood streets representatives that how big a difference in the lecture and make sure yeah\nOr Dan Hoffman what are your thoughts\nWell you know this is a bit of a self inflicted well Shawn from the Saudis I

is on the air right now right Mr mall one [laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nAnd there was a twenty four teams study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part-time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call a lease officers race from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage right that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now to the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America\nThe law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than\nPoint one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worse than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here now the question is I I Know\nThat Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular\nLevel to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm a oh stop brown one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman is association is never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety ... here she is insulting law enforcement so\nThis is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever on\nThis is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "21"}
