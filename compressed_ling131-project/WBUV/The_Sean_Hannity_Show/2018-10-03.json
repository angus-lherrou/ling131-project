Brady Fox News sources telling Fox the FBI's supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nIs expected to be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as today they've been conducting interviews about sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh while the partisan sniping over the handling of the allegations continues\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any obligation\nNow I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence\nThat is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights pundits\nIn ... writes that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nOf covering the cabinet case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hanging goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly\nThat that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person the backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still\nRan the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does that were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying\nWell well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualify for someone to finish Supreme Court\n[noise] why we need an FBI agent because there\nA lot of allegations for its really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel\nAnd ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly Avon no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day she said they were for people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now\nBased on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor forward but I I mean professor Ford has now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise] um you know it's just [noise]\nI I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that mattered Lindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way assaulted a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office apparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're gonna have to start kicking people out of ... of these\nSenate buildings in Congo congressional offices because I'm gonna tell somebody's going to get hurt [noise]\nUm and I'm all for free speech but you ought to be able to walk out your door and not get surrounded by groups of people screaming at you if you represent\nAnd in the country Mitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and\nSo we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done\nForward complaining the FBI never contacted her but they have a story what else do they need and much more I Will get the oldest today eight hundred dying for one show more in our nation's Capitol Newt Gingrich is going to stop by\nFox's Sean decker live at the White House\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defending the president's remarks in Mississippi last night in which you appear to be mocking the Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford the woman who is accused judge Kevin ... of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school\nThe president's simply stating the fact that she laid out interests that she owned testimony and that the prosecutor laid out in her mental at the end of the day this and it has to make a decision on where they stand Republican\nSouth Dakota Senator John Thune describe the president's style and tone is

to the top of the hour as we continue from our nation's capital Washington DC so at the FBI investigation now coming to and and and the Senate planning their vote and moving forward on all of this\nUm the big question it with all the news today you know what do we see happening is in the next\nFour days what are we see happening\nYou know five weeks from yesterday you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters wheelchair hurt committee impeach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election now it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know if if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections were Republicans led a generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems competent she's out there I'm going to be the next speaker well you don't get to decide that\nIt's actually in the hands of the American people now we can't make you vote but we can only tell you what's gonna happen\nIf in fact the Democrats win and what's gonna happen is very basic fundamental and simple\nIs they will have endless non stop investigations Kavanaugh gets through they want to impeach Kavanaugh they want to impeach the president they want to investigate all things president what do you think this Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey've they figure it out the Kavanaugh debate is over so now they're moving on to the next thing and that's the old reliable which is the mayor slander you know bludgeon Donald Trump\nYou know ... how many years ago that his father die that's how far back they want to go\nAnd so I don't think it's going to be the story of people say but you know they don't have a vision for you\nThey don't have a plan for you there's no discussion among any Democrat I ever see not one that says this is what we're going to do to help improve the lives of the American people\nAt the risk of being repetitive just bear with me

roaring hot guy's name is mark does handy predicted\nIn twenty sixteen that the Trump presidency would lead lead to an economic disaster he's now saying it's rip roaring hot it was on CNBC so that's

can barely walk at his age he's an elderly man getting in his face in an airport\nThat's what they they're telling people to do Spartacus has been saying at Maxine Waters is saying it and by the way

dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in that that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion\nWe've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats that would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh they'll only do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week ... most of the week and his media tour which is the second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal in fact\nAll those things I think I mean that the Susan Collins who what was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days\nOf which you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumped pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president has set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said and I he said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're ... we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to do but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nYou want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to\nControl the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from ... from ... are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the seat Nevada but\nI think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nPlus we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radicalization I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wager campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happen to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example\nA government run health care means taxpayer abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we're there to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to

I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was a California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do accusation that's how the person's signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen who's truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute education for miss Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied him like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for\nLawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then she said oh\nI there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is that perhaps Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken but\nI ... I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here is the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety\nNow why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe because we're talking about the we all know\nThat there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations and charges seriously they handled it professionally therefore that every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats are they just they just now have pushed this so far into it it ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence\nNo matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent shot us in happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she does say\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back\nMore with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova
