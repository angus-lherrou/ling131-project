Brett\nKavanaugh I'm waiting just like you certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind meantime\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr ...\nAnd all was the one oh exposed himself and that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words so that's what the Democrats are said this is a credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh\nWhen he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people I mean that's just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember Dianne Feinstein had this first six long weeks\nShe had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right of professor forward or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and won emails sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed never cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brecht cabin on his year book page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording is in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and\nWe know that in the case or professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at\nThe end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they're all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that I witnessed has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened\nWhat professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody took ... please please come forward and then the hope is that it'll be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that then we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes then the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that when he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it\nAnd so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had two of blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the number two and after two they lose it\nFor some people I there were people that every single night work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individuals individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's\nQuestioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house\nAnd Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't if this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better\nThat has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six test the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have but getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching the news channels\nAnd you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda there's blood thinning of cabin all this the agenda that just destroy Trump\nThe agenda of higher taxes they want their crumbs back the agenda of open borders and eliminating ice\nI'm waiting just like you

she waited 'til we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I\nPlease Mr President\nYou said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the skill of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... the other headline and then as I can count but and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever had a great deal of hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight now or to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one\nSean has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now sir how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly in an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trying out judicial temperament of this whole thing is is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall\nIs which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe something while he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day that wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying uh we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge how this is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H mayor cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to arrest US Senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of this this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused of literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play trying for a minute because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example though you're getting one Blumenthal as the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't know suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than plainly state it\nIs that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points and dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nMachine not some random back bench not cake she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at at the at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nI'm like when you are but the point is\nI think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people because if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is nobody is\nOr at least a today the names of those who lost their lives a year ago were red in reflection\nThe rain Anders\nPraying for

bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party

FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to\nBe interviewed and I would assume by now for the probably we're\n... I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said\nGoing to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that's fine you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works at that at every Democrat that it's now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLife long reputation here on the line\n[noise] take your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well and this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets ... and many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this couch them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is it kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times he found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a\nHat but but it\nUp you know the parents to draw to reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the ... in the bureau special agents have all said Jimmy never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and if you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement\nWithout a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look hit hit companies coming MO right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI does to say that that that somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as ... as well make that can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my production\nAnd I'm Democrat and I are ... that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you
