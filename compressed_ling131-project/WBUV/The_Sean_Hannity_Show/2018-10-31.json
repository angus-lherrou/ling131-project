said Monday his office had up to a month to present the case to a federal grand jury well that result came much faster a shooter Robert Bowers was indicted today on forty four total county which includes federal hate crimes\nThe shooter hate Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel\nAnd yet that doesn't stop them from collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump were the synagogue shooting\nBut yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nFor in this country is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about if you stop\nI mean things about me I'll stop and signing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated for Trump\nIs doing is ... and ... for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events\n... match is dishonest as they are\nBlind I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that has been ... by the president of the United states for the rich but for some I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in in just a matter of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not it's in it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and there's still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is in is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media is universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get Pfizer warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem and the president went against it in many ways what\nIs a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east one super all because of the threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was ... maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think it's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about what they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for that finally admitting that year old white castle list and then you have a we've been some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are Lincoln George Soros and these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan Fox News talking about small pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I I won't say specifically white regime this is out of but go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ... biggest her\nFor it in this country is white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere's no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the fact that so he seems to be hearing in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail attack against and migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you things on the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of the theaters and\nInvasion these tragedies working at cross purposes right narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of vilified gang migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joyous pay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also times got along with them as as cars out there who not only\nTo find out I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh he's in New York character he's not Republican or Democrat he's an advocate [laughter] [noise] and I don't mean that an ad hominem driveway [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they ... a ... look there are three scenarios as I said\nFor election night will be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do the fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that the election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white flash you know against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not it\nIs they end up back at their head really fear you the American people and what you're going to decide\nEvery race matters is four hundred and thirty five house races you vote for any Democrat or you stay home\nYou're voting for ... as the next speaker all these important Senate races Florida Tennessee Texas Ted Cruz a Claire McCaskill I'm Josh Hawley Missouri\nNevada or Arizona Montana North Dakota Indiana New Jersey West Virginia\nThey're afraid of what the results are going to be I'm not afraid of any result we I can deal with whatever hand the American people people deal us\nFrom Lisa us attorney Scott Brady said Monday his office had up to a month to present the case to a federal grand jury well that result came much faster as shooter Robert Bowers was indicted today one forty four total counts which include federal hate crimes\nBowers is charged with using a high powered rifle in hand guns to kill eleven people at the tree of life synagogue last Saturday\nBowers was subdued after being shot by police he's in jail without bond and it set for a second court dig tomorrow ... says he and his attorneys will spare no resource in seeking justice against Bauer ...\nTimes three

a head of the midterms meantime the mass caravan of migrants heading up from Central America has been shrinking a bit but still in the thousand\nSeven to five thousand numbers are very hard to come by legitimate ones that is but definitely some people have taken the train some are going ahead on their own some people that I've got to know are gone now or medical issues\nA swollen glands in plain muscles that kind of thing so there was a rally here last night no news really coming from the states no news programming just the movie Coco a to add some Lebanese here no mention of the military build up the changes in asylum\nThat may be coming to them the density that the president's proposing or how long these people could be stuck in Tijuana\nConsciously unless you're asking well how come

hundred and Ninety nine locked in Republican side you have all these thirty some odd races that are now going to tip the balance of power for the house\nConventional wisdom says that Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker I'd do look at the polls quite the same way Nancy Pelosi picking out the drapes\nOr for her new office was on the Late Show with Stephen Kobe or protecting Democrats would win

in Washington state and the eighth district Dino Rossi will step in and check in with us a little bit later\nOr in Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently and I love these people in the Democratic side they're all\nSaying the same thing healthcare health care either way welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but they have people that gave us that they're going to give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and\nThat is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is just a part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nAnd abused it last and used it more for the advancement of humankind around the world paying the price for

Mendez carried on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nGuilt or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll to having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else and help them get back into New Jersey because we are going to go out you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see you know I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare

Democrats are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now 'cause they're they're very ... very much in the air and they're I think people now know listening should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out and voted to end up not election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or were with the Republicans having the majority all of those top subs put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally [noise] ah I I my personal range is reaching the bottom of about two oh one which would mean Pelosi speaker and the high ground to twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been candid about fishing I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think I Am ... and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment and lives investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nIn a hard left the house and people are like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt like tells you how crazy

who says I'm tired of it all I don't like them or a senator or I'm not going to not voting\nIs in effect a half a vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's\nI don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for policy at the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for reticent in Tennessee ... you're you're voting for humor and I know that it's probably not the way\nIn these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nBut I just tell everybody he wanted to some of the claims you're a moderate Democrat and struggling with really say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house will cost them ... you know I sort of have to do that fine\nTo treat them throwing level if they said you know I'm really kind of a

think it does this make her look I think that's that's that's a pretty\nFrankly it's a very reasonable statement of where we are and\nHow we could approach it uh in terms of birthright itself or there is no provision fourteenth amendment [noise] once you're handing away Rick orange people who were born outside the jurisdiction of the law\nTo be considered as citizens and she's very including the beach on it when the Congress of the time when it's clearly if you leave that to the constitutional number nine\nTo very clear and what it means uh I\nPersonally think the president's far better off

law there'll be a pretty hard while I was going to change and once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges the kind

ideas about how\nAmerica has got to look America is going to make a choice there is now a movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats or I think it is one party one

it GMC studios his talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\nPresident denies playing politics with immigration I mean the Brady Fox News reporters asking him a short time ago whether he's using the thousands of migrants heading north from Central America to scare voters ahead of next week's elections\nI ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting 'cause most Republicans you don't think of California Raisins being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in and which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house or come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think\nA real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can ... exactly yeah so\nTell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nTo where you had overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats so we are seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news of a it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nGet one of the probably lose you will ever have swinging\nBack is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your dues that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of the of the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hold the people in those districts do understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much or I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called all of a New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and\nWho am I wasn't done a thing for upstate New York and the fact of Pennsylvania's takes all of the natural gas from New York and they were allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I I I'm\nIn that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um\nI told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's has that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and ah yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up\nYet again and less coverage getting dang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was just calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nAre but anyway Mary thank you I
