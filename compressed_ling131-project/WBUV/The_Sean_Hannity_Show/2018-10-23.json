Nassau County stand in the street corners and in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to see people waiting to get picked up\nTo go do yard work and construction work and domestic work you know ... this is not a problem that the people were coming into the country are solely responsible for the winter is coming if we put them to work my\nWill keep families together\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship number of immigrants added to the labor force every year as of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most coworkers provides some benefits calling me as a whole it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up or those\nImmigrant rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it was suggested that I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration quite amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up well\nI'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of ... Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau of bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on a loan that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] ... that's personal but you know the fact is the never Trump or his are a\nFossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up I I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise] I don't know anybody\nIn American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it boasts very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know there are ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice\nBut to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws\nAnd I do and in the process the people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he I mean I talk to them at a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to hit me this morning if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico only if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be\nThat Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back the border but under no circumstances should we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he'd dean should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision he just has to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and they're blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border and my\nFear is if they get to the border that would could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember\nIn the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best foot plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator effect to human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow than actually going to have what what could be but it down as much she's ten or Fifteen thousand people 'cause they ask keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point\nWe we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln saying over and over again yeah ah you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union he didn't say it happily he didn't say that excited Lee ... many of his key early speeches\nOr this nostalgic sadness to them\nOr that we are bound together by the common core of mystique memory and that we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost cleaning you know don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end\nAnd people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh

especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and passed it what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others that say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am young lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you've got to say that I have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a at African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was

poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot
