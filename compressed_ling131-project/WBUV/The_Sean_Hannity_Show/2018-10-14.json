Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nOf being you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from all the Ford or being from Ramirez or from Avon ladies client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have yours are high\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that unconscious\nOr should have the ... app\nAnd pop [laughter] hey my point is today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quoted came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for Barbara ... and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending toward civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh\nThe law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right uh with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy wasn't worth it then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time there they seek a issue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose but my point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now abandoned any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militants and violet socialism to achieve their means\nMy point they're not that different there just mass getting less

O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final Pfizer warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ...\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed in private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here\nAre the top people at the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the O. J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ... investigative reporter is what the hell rag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... leads to page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being leaked for the purposes\nAnd they got rid of all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so it would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah petitions Lee's taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nIf there was one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... in may and they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump or fire read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses are McKay\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove that confident in well over a quarter\nAnd a and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... with you I'm sure record talking about the history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page as\nWell at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing in nine months leading up to this point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nThere and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is a group of rogue\nPower hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get\nFired that's right and in fact I interviewed former top\nOfficials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey\nAndrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page Peters struck for ruining the reputation the\nGood name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups\nWhat's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are\nAndrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead serious\nPeople to invoke the twenty\nFifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness and said oh I was misunderstood and now\nIn his attempted coup of the president or the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my words were misinterpreted it was just sarcasm there is a pattern of conduct here on the part of\nSteve until the U.S knows what happened to Jamal ...

special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nOther words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the ... say something that they could use and then vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page and go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and\nThe they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWhen he was pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same dusty a that was never corroborated to verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers have guy by the name of Michael Sussman directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election\nOther words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it why did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying\nHere that is wrong Greg Garrett you've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nFavor of that and I do believe in protecting

source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right buyer\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true\nFrom the beginning Lisa Page even testify to that effect\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an a counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right you know there was a guy that testified a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention on the script guy but his name is bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss he was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were admitting that by using that information for Christopher Steele ... they had just gotten vetting it hadn't been and yet the standard for the fight it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate should process and yet they're using it presenting it as that stance to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before ... port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld information like have you back that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes here\nOh you know you just defies alone is deprivation of rights under color of law known as abusive power so so perjury because they signed off

Justice Department I said hey there might be problems here we don't really want you to do this you should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court

met his and\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got a bad accident right\nRight uh you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is I mean\nHave to make more of the services they provide affordable and they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care bound nation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to help these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... at the same the same ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism\nAre and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots water we ensuring is using the insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nNow using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock to gather news and who is now offering free health care but everybody he whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides a fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with\nThe economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send him an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it so you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something mental stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except what major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but Wilson oh we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\n... a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and in past the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nBut they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down\nThere right let's take New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can\nThey're so far Saudi

Steve\nTerm elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean and a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back down looking back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the ...\nBirds that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nShow I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage ... not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out\nI mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime and literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe thinks he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... the psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible offer Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near\nFuture yeah and and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that
