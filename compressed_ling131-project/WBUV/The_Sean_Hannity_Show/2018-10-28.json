they pick and choose their targets that's exactly well\nMay be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top crazy

training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means\nWe don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in\nFourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this\nBut the other the say listen I'm tired of this because of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and emulate it so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you take say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixteen was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his messages recurring tell him his message was made in the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which\nIs really good for what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because just starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this today but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believes that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left is authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nIdentity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich

an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things that are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim ... gates whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan and keep your

[noise] punk scene\nFrom the mantle viewing GMC studios this is talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nAll right it's getting sicker every day I mean I noticed the same thing the ... the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want the beer anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using it but he's Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover is bad brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much and I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching\nTowards our border I mean they they literally\nAre mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light show on like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump\nTwitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of the Native American and your mate into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base\nThat Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay\nMe too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemembered the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country if\nYou have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border to participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted off the walls I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... will get their answer possible\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job\nOut of the bottom ... percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donny\nDonny Donny call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... down if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave as a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she used to all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that\nIt seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nOn equal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know what you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf the professors Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps as a dramatic turn around and they're back happily working\nAnd some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back quick break

she I supported the wall just remembering the fact that we're doing whatever votes on the ground saying\nOkay 'cause I guess is as or something like making people go she doesn't support the wall and the other day I don't know I was asked to do and don't say that she doesn't really want them the time is\nThat he didn't really understand this is my head and\nYou are they're going to tell me while I\nWas right on the wall or was the one who has a world for the wrong\nNo she didn't move against the wall [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] you know for a\nNew wave and\nElse is going\n\nAnd then ...\nMore than they do they want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill\nThe pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nOr speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the bottom it looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your bar poster down and the staffer says\nWell because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers they're emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they're ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that her party's pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that ... that's what we do it very possibly confirms suspicions and we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or
