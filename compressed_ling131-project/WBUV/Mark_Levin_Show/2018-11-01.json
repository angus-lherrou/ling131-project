had an IRA and they inherited\nThe whole thing or a piece of it and they don't know what to do with and there's all kinds of rules to ... those are the two big topics so I imagine ... uh I'm going to push a couple of those cars that we did some great work\nCompiling those two topics in the last week that's where we are going to run on Thursday well a Gregory ... at the October breast cancer awareness month benefit Halley wolf doors open at six PM you know where the ... sat right over warehouse district downtown New Orleans\nSo yeah some ticket Web dot com and if you go to Google and just do bra country it will pull\nYou there oh Ramsey jewelers one of the sponsors\nAs well yeah I went to a W ... dot com or sister station here in New Orleans and that's where I\nPulled it up as W and oh we dot I heart dot com\nThat's a good picture of actually at the top it's not what she looks like in real life hey so did you see the same article I did 'cause I saw you referenced the number of how much would it take to start a McDonald's franchise\nYeah\nYeah so the average total start up investment is between is about one to two million bucks depending on\nWhere you're at but what caught my attention was\nThe um revenue from it\nA hundred and fifty thousand that's profit that's not even revenue that yeah well that's what I mean profit but you know revenue yeah quite a bit of revenue but whatever the average one makes about a hundred and fifty thousand in profit it's a lot of burgers yeah that's a lot of burgers that's a lot of money to put out\nThere and\n... million nuts Fifteen Percent profit two million seven and a half\nWhich still pretty good but I don't know if I Want to put two million out there for seven and a half\n[noise] so if you want to make a million a year you need ten McDonalds\nOh man I mean you may want to own that hard it is it is you've got to go through acquiring a bunch of stores to make some money well here's the air in another interesting thing the actual franchise fee that you know just a ...\nThe building is its own set of expense all the equipment whatever but if you want to say I have to worry McDonald's on your\nFranchise forty five thousand dollars just for the rights to use the name by comparison to become a chick fillet franchisee that franchise fee is ten thousand dollars\nSo\nOkay better a little less selective huh\nWell\nYou're not going to buy one if you want to be open on Sundays\nThat's true too yeah and you know ... let's see how many things they do less the uh just one thing chicken they do good and they have something I Wish everyone else had diet lemonade is I Love lemonade and I don't like what you have to have diet yeah\nI Know another franchise that does chicken only canes\nYeah Louisiana based yeah yeah they have lemonade I don't know about the diet but they have some good lemonade over there too\nI I'm just I'm not on a diet it's just I just want to keep my wife interested in that's all okay here's another a wicked statistic unless you wanted to jump in I don't know if I interrupt you a second ago but the this one doesn't make you very happy Gregory the top three percent of taxpayers in the United states\nPay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen which means the top three percent pay more than Seventy\nMillion Americans [noise] when it comes to taxes a lot of people like to focus on the income inequality well there's also a tax inequality too and when when you see that the spread right there\nAs looks like it's pretty much in line right seems pretty fair to me if\nThey're going to be making all this money they got to pay a lot of the taxes so I won't grab by the taxes if they don't gripe about the time is that a deal Gregory\nYeah this is Mike are you you're good there yeah this was interesting a story every red actually a week ago about the a mattress from filing for bankruptcy so we've been another big firms spin around\nFor like two decades file for chapter ... bankruptcy protection the mouse they would be closing as many as seven hundred stores in the U.S and I believe they've closed a couple of stores\nOr around\nThe metro New Orleans or I haven't looked along the Gulf Coast\nAnd such but mattress from is the U.S largest specially mattress retailer was an estimated three thousand two hundred and Seventy two stores across us according to wed Bush\nAnalysts Seth ... store counters grown significantly in the past years as it is expanded quickly an acquired competing change such as sleep piece which purchasing twenty sixteen what the heck is sleeping it's a mattress\nPlace you know kinda makes you sleepy [laughter] and accommodate sleeping I got the chain um they had\nToo many stores than us given the mattress says are a product that is typically about every seven to ten years\nYou don't grow up there by ah you know we've had this thing for a year to go spend another grand get a new\nOne or just throw some pat on it it'll be fine according to a start up think I'm forty two point six percent of mattress firms spores are located within a mile radius of each other\nWell that's kind of a problem what yeah\nThey just oh there's one Merrill is all move stores into their idea that the proximity of mattress for firms store locations is related to money laundering or any illegal activity is absolutely false Murphy into Business Insider\nWhy didn't bring it up like that [laughter] what are you worried about it\nIs yes I Do yeah that was thrown out there so there are some law suits and stuff on that but at the end of twenty Seventeen its parent company Stein hall holdings which is currently being investigated on charges of fraud said it would be closing two hundred mattress firms\nAt the time and analysts expect that many more\nWould follow suit and that ah I see what's going on but when you start going in and looking at the numbers which I don't have here in front of me but when you start looking at the numbers and the amount of money owed\nTo these mattress companies it's scary it's it's ... Dick you'll is\nThat that they have piled up and a Stein off has financial\nManagement problems there's a lot of money mismanagement in the company that led to these difficulties there\nWhat ultra low rate ... basically encouraged all these entities to go out and go get some of that cheap money while they can and then a rising rate world is going to make an untenable I see what you're saying they'll use that they have over three thousand stores one thousand of them though are right around lake Ozark it's the weirdest thing is [laughter]\nAnd that's a money laundering joke from Netflix for those few and by the way I'm almost caught up to you we're gonna have to have a chat about that soon but um two episodes behind so hey uh we\nGot another event coming up in November fourteenth so it is exactly one week away ...

mine is the last of the shows without reruns on Fox on the weekend before the election on that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case because it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said\nAnd I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\n\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest\nThey obviously want this\nThey want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar it is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already they said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says and some of these conservatives say\n'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case then how is the statute gonna fix statue won't fix it\nBecause they're saying you have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\n\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass this statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\n\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to me write about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than they do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist\nConcocted an ingenious game of judicial sir premises him that create say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq\nWalk collectively ignoring enlist I'm interrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOff for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F Wilson Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no new principal on quote quote it is not the object to this bill to establish new rights but to protect\nAnd enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared an Eighteen sixty six I Want you to

lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens would be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\n\nThe first sentence of the fourteenth amendment all persons\nBorn or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at the time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not owning allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory\nAre subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our

and anything I Do not want Nancy Pelosi the speaker I Do not want Maxine Waters to become chair of the house financial services committee so this country that I'm willing to lay down my life for on the battlefield is one is worth fighting for in Congress it's an honor to be there\nAre but I'm not going to be intimidated I'm not going to tower I Know obviously that you never will your your audience won't ah and that's the country that we're fighting for its only six days we could do this we can keep control of the house we can even pick up a few seats in the Senate and the alternative scares the heck out of me\nAt least selling if the nation wants to help you and the people in on Long Island in your area there you want to get involved where do they go\n[noise] does that will be for Congress dot com or you can visit my Web site\nOn Facebook at least ... and I mentioned my Twitter at least ... wherever you live if you have a ... a Republican who's running against one of these on hand just\nLeftists who want to take our country in the wrong direction you're fighting on the street on your block with your neighbors with your friends knowing can stay home you can't wake up on November seventh\nComplaining about the country that we have if we don't fight for these next six days you have to earn that with your vote\nAnd you're such a great patriot and that's all we have to do with men and women all over the world who are facing enemies their lives are endangered they've left their comfort of home and their families as you did a some years back\nAll we have to do his boat make sure five or six people who we know of like minded also boat and we will strongly a defeat the other side\nThat's right and and our national security I mean the embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem the president not just fulfilling his own campaign promise and doing the right thing but filling promises of presidents past withdrawing from the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal\nWithdrawing from the Paris accords were we were making these commitments on our end Waller country like China was agreeing to actually increase emissions\nMaking your understanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president any national security team behind\nThem that is ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected again and I love it\nWe have to continue going in the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist\nI Know that if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all where we've had conflicts in the past where we send our troops in harm's way and we set them up to fail\nSo I feel good as as a U.S citizen and with with where we are national security as a member of Congress and also someone who I actually just got selected last week for promotion lieutenant colonel", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "01"}
