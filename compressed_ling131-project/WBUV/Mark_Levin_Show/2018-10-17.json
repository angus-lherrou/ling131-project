I see a little bit different I um I've got two different account irate individual Cal\n... previous job that our older years ago and it's being managed by an individual and then I have a boiling at work\nThat I put as much toward that can forty one\nAnd I guess I'm just trying to figure out\nMy doing what I'm doing\nMore harm behind it seemed like\nBut I don't know how far is really the question\nSo what's the value of those two accounts combined\nThe IRA has about a hundred and thirty in it\nAnd the four oh one K. has about six minutes\nHow much are you adding a year\nI Do hopper set\nA standard the regular retirement\nNumber give me a number not a percentage of the year with the matching\nThe question I'm saying let's see I Do ah it's probably\nAround eight thousand yeah eight or nine about your total between standard in Raul eight percent five and three three raw that probably between eight nine now\nSo without figuring any compounding what you're also telling me based on current numbers are going to put away about two hundred K. over the next Twenty years and you have close to two hundred cutting now so you're up four hundred thousand\nSo we need that become number in I what we have is the guy did planning system it's a word book that we populate put ... where the money's at\nWe ... we put in a reasonable expectation to kind of give you an idea of where you're going to be a down the road and we can plug in Social Security pension and so forth depending if you're retiring at sixty sixty five or Seventy and that helps give you an idea of where you're going\nYou're putting away money you're going to make money and you're going to put away more and my suggestion is you're probably need to get more ... than a thousand a year one of the things you need to think about is you you need to get\nThis thinking in your head just right you have to have a million dollars and it's probably going to need to be more but just thinking a million dollars in today's dollars four percent stream forty thousand a year your Social Security call at thirty their sovereignty can you make it on Seventy thousand a year in the future\nThank you Kenny let's to John in Lockport you're going to be left up on a winning it life with Gregory ...

they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake that to me like you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhat it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes a Ford did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people go without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch\nOf people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some lines\nThat are up and that's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nAnd Asian men they will only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment\nRight out oh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with him but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry leftist that goes yeah but I I haven't seen any benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments so if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI Want to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nTake a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically all these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've always kept to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation when as I say we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it and it's important to know who in what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it

for him to remain there and be tortured because well you have many more potential witnesses and a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios

that by the way so I'm Sorry oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you oh good for a\nWhile I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on a night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen\nAnd Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that not really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at ya but they're the same they were covering the same cloth especially Springsteen where they were anti war or they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swaths of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen made that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's\nKind of like a no offense to you and in in Jersey Joe but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost had the center of the state um for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know more conservative area but I I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who\nWho rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my ...\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is then irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent up these celebrity but you know hey just a\nWarning out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some work to do in Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota hailing\nOh I'm not liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with
