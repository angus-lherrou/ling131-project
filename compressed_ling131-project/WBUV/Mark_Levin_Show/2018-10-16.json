{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Sort of a survey of what people call on the most the two topics where we get the most causes people trying to figure out when and how to turn on Social Security and the other one is it's just IRAs 'cause so many people are touched by them either they had to themselves or their spouse has won or\nMom or grandma\nOr an aunt or an uncle somewhere else had an IRA and they inherited the whole thing or a piece of it and they don't know what to do with and there's all kinds of rules ... those are the two big topics so I imagine we're a I'm going to push a couple of those cars that we did some great work\nCompiling those two topics in the last week that's where we are going to run on Thursday while a Gregory ... at the October breast cancer awareness month benefit Howlin' Wolf doors open at six PM\nAnd uh you know where the hell and wall sat right over warehouse district downtown New Orleans\nSo yet some ticket Web dot com and if you go to Google and just to bra country it will pull you there are\nRamsey is jewelers one of the sponsors as well yeah I went to a W dot com or sister station here in New Orleans and that's where I\nPulled it up as W and we ... I heart dot com\nThat's a good picture of actually at the top so she looks like in real life hey so did you see the same article I did cause us all you referenced the number how much would it take to start a McDonald's franchise\nYeah yeah so the average total start up investment is between is about one to two million bucks depending on where you're at\nBut what caught my attention was the um revenue from it hundred and fifty\nThousand that's profit that's not even revenue that yeah well that's what I mean profit but you know revenue yeah quite a bit of revenue but\nWhatever the average one makes about a hundred and fifty thousand a profit it's a lot of burgers yeah that's a lot of burgers that's a lot of money to put out\nThere in\n... million that's Fifteen Percent profit two million seven and a half\nWhich still pretty good but I don't know if I Want to put two million out there for seven and a half ago uh [noise] so if you want to make a million a year you need ten McDonalds oh man I mean you may have been hard\nIt is it is you've got to go through acquiring a bunch of stores to make some money\nWell here's their inner another interesting thing the actual franchise fee that you know just a ... the building is its own set of expense all the equipment whatever but if you want to step toward McDonald's on your franchise forty five thousand dollars just for the rights to use the name ...\nHarris and to become a chick fillet franchisee that franchise fee is ten thousand dollars\nSo\nI think I better a little less selective huh\nWell\nYou're not going to buy one if you want to be open on Sundays that's true too yeah and you know let's see how many things they do let's see uh just one thing chicken\nThey do good and they have something I Wish everyone else had diet lemonade because I Love lemonade and I don't like what\nYou have to have diet yeah I Know another franchise that does chicken only canes yeah Louisiana based yes yes they have lemonade I don't know about the diet but they have some good lemonade over there too\nI I just I'm not on a diet it's just I just want to keep my wife interested that's all [noise] okay here's another a wicked statistic unless you wanted to jump in I don't know if I interrupt you a second ago but the this one doesn't make you very happy Gregory the top three percent of taxpayers in the United states\nPay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen which means the top three percent pay more than Seventy million Americans when it comes to taxes [noise] lot of people like to focus on the income inequality well there's also a tax inequality too and when when you see the the spread\nRight there are ... looks like it's pretty much in line right seems pretty fair to me they're going to be making all this money they got to pay a lot of the taxes so I won't grab by the taxes if they don't gripe about the time is that a deal Gregory\nYeah this is Mike are you you're good there\nYeah this was interesting a story every red actually a week ago about the a mattress from filing for bankruptcy so we've been another big firms been around for like two decades file for chapter ... bankruptcy\nProtection they announced it would be closing as many as seven hundred stores in the U.S and I believe they've closed a couple of stores or around\nThe metro New Orleans or I haven't looked along the Gulf Coast\nAnd such but mattress from is the U.S large especially mattress retailer was an estimated three thousand two hundred and Seventy two stores across us according to wed Bush\nAnalysts Seth ... store counters grown significantly in the past years as it is expanded quickly an acquired competing change such as sleep piece which purchasing twenty sixteen what the heck is sleeping at some mattress place you know kinda makes you sleepy [laughter]\nThat accommodate sleeping I got the chain um they had too many stores than us given the mattress says are a product that is typically about every seven to ten\nYears you don't go out there by ah you know we've had this thing for a year to go spend another grand get a new one\nGod just\nThrow some pads on it it'll be fine according to a start up think I'm forty two point six percent of mattress firms stores are located within a mile radius of each other well that's kind of a problem what yeah\nThey just oh there's one Merrill is all move stores into their idea that the proximity of mattress for from store locations is related to money laundering or any illegal activity is absolutely false Murphy do Business Insider\nWhy didn't bring it up like that [laughter] what are you worried about it is yes\nI Do yeah that was thrown out there so there are some law suits and stuff on that but at the end of twenty Seventeen its parent company Stein hall holdings which is currently being investigated on charges of fraud said it would be closing two hundred mattress firms\nAt the time and analysts expect that many more\nWould follow suit and that uh I see what's going on but when you start going and and looking at the numbers which I don't have here in front of me but when you start looking at the numbers and the amount of money owed to these mattress\nCompanies it's scary it's it's ... ... death that they have\nPiled up and a Stein off has financial management problems is a lot of money mismanagement in the company that led to these difficulties there\nWhat ultra low rates have basically encouraged all these entities to go out and go get some of that cheap money while they can and then a rising right world is going to make an untenable I see what you're saying though you say that they have over three thousand stores one thousand of them though\nAre right around like Ozark it's the weirdest thing is [laughter] and that's a money laundering joke from Netflix for those few and by the way I'm almost caught up to you we're gonna have to have a chat about that soon but I'm two episodes behind so uh we got another event coming up November fourteenth\nSo it is exactly one week away ... I mean one week one month away and his over halfway full however it's not too late to go in RSVP reserve your seat is going to be six thirty PM Ruth's Chris in ... it's a Wednesday so it's not going to coincide with the saints game and have to worry about it\nBut a calm pie you've been wanting to come by to last event and the one before that and the one before that and make this one the one gifts of nice little early Christmas present combined meat Gregory and find out what he can do with your money and if you like it and I think it's going to be a good fit than you'll just coming to the office enjoy some wine at stake in the meantime and or just have a good\nWednesday so far as the the it's a website Gregory risk dot com called the office Bible for a three to Ninety two zero zero calorie scribe rephrase the job [noise] your home away from the show when he got laughs dot com and the winning at life app on James Parker we are winning it life was ... [noise]\n\n[noise] from them and do you see in the studios [noise] this is talk for nine points and I urge radio station [noise] [noise]\nAnd of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes of course they're gonna do well under a tax cuts that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut it's not a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they have been a hard and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing\nFraming the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question it to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance it she re frames it\nIn his way perfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way\nThat the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical\nTrump knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listen she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter say sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rough for him to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period end the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know folks\nThey sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on just a simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSoul tries to stop\n'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hit the hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a at a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they're they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\nI mean who\nWhat other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican\nAnywhere anywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grades or I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly on the lips by driving them to win Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic Elizabeth Warren will not let this go find it go let aces embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a living at a whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing electric work you're an architect you gotta sit here and listen to a woman who put down on her form to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American Native American heritage wrote an entry into a cookbook about powwow chow\nThat's real by the way it is\nAnd and as possibly one one thousand and twenty fourth America\nThis is about give it a Democratic Party of I I just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal guy\nBattle scars and all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas I'll bet I'll bet

because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy stuff is going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes the quality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest film little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you

break in the case\nOver the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan\nAnd various others [noise]\nI've been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that it with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter]\nThe Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warns issue to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes too that way to liberals can't review what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper levels of their management chain\nTo go after the Trump that's it now why am I bring that up now not to give you like oh what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe\nUnleash the just the torrent of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at the time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times\nThat they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha\nBank that's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried to ... for bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out the\nShocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris is to\nHave snow George Papadopoulos that George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a Pfizer

that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ... and\nHere say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\n[noise] support and

fruits and vegetables legumes whole grains and fish with only moderates consumption of wine and dairy products and although it is called the Mediterranean quote unquote die\nThat's it's really more of a lifestyle of eating that relies more heavily on consuming whole foods rather than counting gallery aside from olive oil and why nothing process is considered to be part of the Mediterranean diet and it's considered the healthiest novel diet just a little food for thought\nOn let's talk help\nOn how can we stop bullying there's no single answer but the ... is important\nWe need to have our educators went and got our parents and our students all on the same page about how they're feeling ...\nHertz director of the national bullying prevention Center for the non profit he served his number one is a common understanding that it's not acceptable and at the silence perpetuating it is broken\nNow what do you do when you do see it happen and you want to be having a conversation about you know if somebody is being bullied number one they have the right to tell somebody\nSays kids also describe bullying is making me feel like less so outreach from up here can you know a lot\nHas saw what happened to you know you didn't deserve that you didn't deserve to be treated that way or hey if you don't have anywhere to set tomorrow come and sit by me in class\nAdvice for parents next week is national bullying prevention month continues its knocks on family I mean\nFrom the men don't view it GMC studios his talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic you know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are\nWell the they pay a lot of money in taxes of course they're going to do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they haven't been a hawk and they're terrified and they backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative in trying to advance she re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis is eight eight is is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nGee automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter stay sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rough some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period end the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paid for this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last words he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last and that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going\nAnd then he says at the end and you know literally and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again\nA battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard and people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did\nBut to show you how that performance contrast with what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they're they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who what other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grades or I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go find it go let aces

every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute\nYou may say okay well you know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent\nFew liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff [noise] pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nSo take about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... they don't pay that rich you don't pay your fair share of you know the ... thing right you don't pay your fair share you don't pay your Fisher it's not the Trump just doesn't accept it around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts\nOver with a you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] good job\n\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the bottom\nNinety what the hell's a fair share if that's not if you hear what I'm ... there's more about this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg\nPeace again not some right wing website here\nI mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure as liberal listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted Web site there that was just trying to manipulate\nThe fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\n\nWhy is is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we had Al Sharpton at his tax debacle we\nHave a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example lead by example if you believe in what you're saying there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we pay taxes sock because we think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day":
