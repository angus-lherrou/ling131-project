bench the scraps at the end of the bench and defeated the starters in a scrimmage [noise] ... that is what role which give him a Nobel to get\nThe rest of what Big Bend set pod cast it by searching the Ben ... show and is always you can hear the Ben Miller show weekdays a joy I mean during eleven pm Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nWhat's the deal was that Dan Patrick's show all of\nThose are great numbers for sake one Barkley but does it prove that you're going to have a great running back but you still need a very good quarterback you have to have a quarterback who at least you can make a play extend to play keep all play alive somehow some way any like can't do that and do the giants look back on this and say oh you know should have taken a quarterback\nOr ... and here's this you know that he's already three on it is a sick and I know del not suffering the gay or not but either way all that's done right at a basket you know I'd say we say yeah there were seven points here\nBut the reality is they didn't bother to figure out whether it was the first out and they just randomly gave him a gathering parents had enough it looked like it was close enough but yeah I well buddies are never got bored I mean obviously it's an unofficial line but ... neither here nor there for the moment but say they actually win\nThat game yesterday would have been so much I mean it's fascinating in in the dumpsters or on fire but if they want it\nYou've been able to you would have been able to sell hope for three days ah it it would\nStill be the same showing up that flat that poorly against\nThe defending champions and your division rivals maybe they would have been in that old and they would have been that bad it ... no ... that's where short weeks are good because you have to forget you have to turn the page you want to bash has done and we're moving on and there's not going to be a loss of lingers into Wednesday or Thursday 'cause we have no choice in the matter\nIt still would have been the same thing you still would have seen this but the giants their roster is terrible so tank\nI made tank and ... and turn around and say we're the smartest guys in the world because we got say going Barclay last\nYear and we got hurt or whoever you want to take a number one overall you know you start printing the shirts yet or what what what tomorrow tomorrow's the game where you're going to ... river for Herbert oh I like that although it sure of it can do your ... sherbet for her nah I don't know her\nCan you a server for because the only other famous Herbert is a guy we don't want to talk about for Family Guy a will there's herb Albert there's her about but not an energy on her or about birth Herbert elder\nYou will get your guy you'll get your quarterback and he'll be on display tomorrow against Washington watch them have this huge game if oh give me a bit of preview into what might upset special is going to be all that shouldn't have huge game and\nIt's going to be some of the ... guy giants fans are going to start watching Oregon gave that night\nTank Hank and do it everybody else will do this is what you have you got to be ... got to be good and you want to correct this horrendous mistake you made last year where we could add San Bernardino that anybody on no no no no fake one Barclay hey go correct that mistake take the rest of the season that's how you figure things out whether he lives the quarterback\nOr whether Phil Simms comes back to play quarterback it doesn't matter tank eaten dirt for Herbert I I don't know we got to go with her for her I like that yeah yeah yeah yeah I liked that eat dirt\nFor Pat Pat and but other than yeah I don't know there's something to hide and then we got to figure that out but certainly for the giants there's so many holes and that's the thing right and we talked about it last night you can find a pod cast up but I just Jason Smith show with my arm and a given five stars will walk ... how'd you\nUh forever alongside our tastes are but the fact of the matter is that you you've got so many holes but the ... back in junior saga\nAllows you to just missed direct everybody 'cause that's where all the attention goes 'cause that's the better movie\nIn one minute we're more on this game going on right now I'm a walk in the Dodgers were in the bottom of the sixth inning of cars has gotten more on this coming up and we get into the oh they'll side of this\nBecause yeah Africa today we got to have to put the effort mentioned\nCarson is with us now with what strength the safe haven chance Milwaukee has won a lemon straight trying to make it twelve and a rubber is lead the Dodgers find one in game one of the national league championship series Pedro by as now and for LA on the hill rough night to Clinton cursed shah\nGave up for earned run he has money granddaughter and a couple of past falls to errors including catchers interference and also\nA a an Arab by Chris Taylor out in the outfield again brewers are the five one lead right now or the Dodgers there in the bottom of the six in Milwaukee and has just gone to file twenty third ranked South Florida survive by kicking a game winning feel do twenty to the art or what just a couple of takes on the clock\nSouth Florida beats Tulsa twenty five at twenty four in the American athletic conference mountain west Airforce lead San Diego state nine seven one forty three to go to second quarter in the past twelve Utah ... over Arizona six and a half to go first quarter\nYou know we don't like to find a fix for a golf game thankfully you can find a fix here check engine light at auto is on the free ... will find the likely issues saving money down the road yet in his own on ozone and finally guys the diamond backs have learned inexpensive lesson\nAfter trying for more than Twenty years to grow grass in the desert inside a stadium where the roof\nThe diamond backs and made a logical choice they are going to synthetic turf at chase field starting next season ploy so you know a dead for Twenty years I've been trying to grow carrots\nInstead of mine and it's not work\nWithout soil oh oh I Need soil down just gets about ... they'll get you to grow grow whatever you need someone tells me that [laughter] you know how come we're live from the studios\nWhere Fifteen minutes can save you a Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance for more information you can visit Geico dot com or Christian yell at yourself runner at second for the brewers are they leave the Dodgers five one as they bad in the bottom of the sixth inning\nBut\nContinuing on with the giants who still stay the big story of the day despite the fact that they got some last night look when you're bad and when you lose it when you're in New York people\nPay attention by the way to graduations to Philadelphia and Carson once for getting on track and taking advantage of the school that is the New York giants now activists as well that is the New York football giants\nSo everywhere we ...\nWe had a big day on social media today and last night we told you about ... and the deal with the auto back him juniors this he had he was fine before the game for his interview he gave with ESPN throwing the team under the bus on Sunday he left the game before half time when the giants officers on the field as he says to go get an IV\nHe walked off by himself to the lock them I'm pretty sure if you're drained and need an IV someone goes with you to the locker room and apparently he's\nThe only guy that can get an IV at ... at halftime because he said you know you only get five minutes ten minutes at halftime you so anybody else needs an ivy you're out of luck right all the other giants needed halftime don't get them because they're all getting on the off the field after the clock actually hit zero no don't got no\nOn staff and James would er and Matthew Modine there's only there's more than you are you there to administer and I leaned pushed out of your life that yeah you see that as with his girlfriend too yeah\nPeople think this is real life uh so what is it just fantasy hell movie how much you want to believe auto back and was the whole I don't doubt that he got an IV and a half time but\nThat's just the way to explain away him saying look at me I'm walking off the field 'cause I'm Upset that we are not winning well it's yeah it's all show yeah well then in the second half he does the whole show of I'm head buddy and electric fan I'm yelling at it and this is due out back and ms you have to put up with the knuckleheads stuff\nTo deal with his talent the giants didn't pay him Ninety million dollars to be like this and\nWhat happens is you not only have to deal with real stuff with the giants but you got to deal with ... knuckle added stuff some of his knuckleheads stuff is just strictly off the field and it's like okay I'll deal with that\nBut a lot of it bleeds into on the field like last night with the whole thing with him leading before I left I just became the big story why did oh do leave the field oh\nDel ray ... said he didn't notice and then he said he didn't think too much doubt it\nYeah you know you I had no idea the ... and this is why\nIt's easy to move on from him but the giants on him to a contract I told you pay and it was going to be the worst thing because he's just going to be the guy he was this is five weeks it already you thought oh he's majority is going to be elite no he was never good immature be a leader the giants got snowed because he acted\nAnd didn't do anything for three weeks them kept waiting for a new contract so it's like trying to they want it to reward a child we was behavioral problems because he behaves well for a tiny period of time all let's make sure we reward you yeah let your water\nAnd all of the back of junior saying if I see that that's all I had to do with three weeks is is is not saying anything oh that was easy method that sent him I said\nWell this is ... and it makes him not worth it because everything you have to go through now the giants have to fix their team and they got to worry about ... what he says next what he does next everything goes into with hotel\nAnd obviously there's a lot of people that love ... and ... wanted to come after me on social media today the one thing I Will say that I'm absolutely sick of people saying when they say oh to Jason you're ridiculous oh he's passionate he just wants to win I Can't believe you're seeing that off the field stuff ...\n\nNinety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of players in the NFL\nWants to win everybody wants to it are there a couple of guys who were there no yeah there there are a couple of guys here that don't want to win but the vast majority Ninety nine percent of guys want to win because you go through so much in a given week preparing for a game\nThat you're in it with everybody else in your locker room you want to win\nEverybody in the NFL wants to win but they also find a way to do it without being a distraction and causing controversy to their team Sam Donald wants to win just as much as\n... Bek um junior does but stand Arnold doesn't do stuff to distract from what's going on with the team same thing with Aaron Rodgers same thing with Russell Wilson same thing with Cam Newton same thing with Ben Roethlisberger all of these guys\nEverybody wants to win every player the quarterbacks a defensive backs but they all but the difference is all these other players find a way to\nHold their emotions in check so they're not hitting their head against the ceiling fan against the electrical fan or hitting a kicking net or leaving before half time 'cause they're so pissed off they're not winning and I say no to that point on and on it because there's Antonio Brown too well but it was still win\nAs he that game one of the ... yeah your obsession with our land the plan yeah yeah evidently at a rally cat or something is out of the media he's got said that he and he's checking his phone every five minutes\nSo he's behind the plate so we thought we were texting Marlins Man but apparently they leave the lab in for Justin prospects and I had the wrong phone number oh\nSo now we got the right phone number we're going to text Marlins Man and see if he'll like give us some kind of message or some kind of sign because he's a friend of the show we've had him on well ... yeah but it was a bad numbers so who ah was\nLee actually texting did he make a connection oh I don't know maybe they're all could be somebody else in a southern Florida who is making all kinds of\nGestures right now things are on television I ... well not at that time it was never do that the uh ... you might think that the cameras the world's watching the walls heavier or even texting front row any ... well I gave it to\nA ball so when you get when you let me know when you get through to Marlins fan and will figure out if you wanted to make an ad or whatever it is whatever gesture he wanted to make\nAs as a sign saying Hi to us a hopefully that can work out some time in the next few minutes now that we have the right number a Milwaukee leaves the Dodgers five one a mat camp is on with a single one out in the top of the seven ... or ... Hernandez is up the Dodgers been trailing in this one pretty much\nWell since we're drift what deep offer Clayton her show that open to that again gates what drove wed\nNeed on Clayton gr ... goes deep off of courage Shaw which shocked the entire world that tied the game that one a couple of errors the brewers take the two to one lead they opened up to five to one and that really has been where the game is that now for the last three innings Josh leader is still in\nFor the brewers as they are going all in to try to take game one\nPot well a lot more baseball and a bit it's time now for

LeBron was in the game ... was that three points US Steel one assessed and one rebounding abroad is out of the game now\nHas played in the fourth quarter what's happened to Alonzo stats\nHe went from three points one in one now he's seven course feels more rebounds too is that this is just a few minutes let's say ... it's going to be a triple double guy but [noise]\nWhen LeBron is not on the court this is when ... was going to have his effect because Lorenzo needs the ball in his hands he needs to be the guy that is coming down from his dark position on deepest to grab a rebound starts\nTo break the other way he's got to be the one that had the poll with his hands and that's going to happen but it's only going to happen when LeBron isn't on the court because you seem abroad that's why they don't really need a point guard having Kyrie Irving why the the guys were so good you know but ... gave the\nBall to LeBron alive because LeBron needs to have it he's not someone that hey I could

who is term\nLimited and actually running against Bill Nelson for the United States Senate in one of the\nMost the board races in the country because Rick has a chance at a Republican pickup\nBill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen points and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie it's kind of unfortunate he he's even in the ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm by mud in Fort Marco then by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but uh nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea and the comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head\nAnd one of the things that I ended up noticing when we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott\nSay there's like a tornado or this you know in hurricanes a lot of people put the focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the wind just as you saw with boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when\nNow Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one or the five tornadoes go right\nTops Hussein wins at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very fortunate my ... my my family has been trying to uh\nTo give me a heart attack I think I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other co some south eastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through towards some power lines near us\nThey were out power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother in Panama City beach you saw the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea he was a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are that close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that it was kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI uh I had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas are just completely wiped out nothing but to a break and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea federal others' homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went\nBack and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three well before those standards went framed homes\nAnd so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit west you go to that one that just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore

pretty close\nAlready so you might hear quite a bit about where Michael ranked historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear the top five ... not quite and drugs are recorded hurricanes in us history\nBut by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that we've tracked since Eighteen fifty one but they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history it was a name to it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in with tops who said when the ... hundred and eighty five miles per hour\nThe second one\nWas hurricane Karen Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nThen you have a ... for the third strongest hurricane at the time of land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two at one sixty five as well the strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall recorded us history what's called the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight that's another one deals with Lake Okeechobee here in South central Florida if you will under sixty miles an hour tops the state of wind so where does Michael Rank\nWhat's wins that a hundred and fifty five miles per hour at the time of landfall this text strongest hurricane and recorded us history that big of a deal\nCertainly prayers go out to the folks impacted direct line they're one of the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today Lebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing in particular like in the in Florida we do\nOften a really good job of minimizing debt at the time of impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will go out there and and make mistakes after hurricane\nThey'll end up dying that's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're hot you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes it just didn't include stepping in water bottle or something with a downed power lines I kind of thing happens and the case of what we are taking a look at though with the with hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks did get out and that we're going to have a a debt told the rise is considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure All right and the end on a lighter note\nI ah I couldn't help but the but they go actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and it was a when I was doing radio in Savannah\nDuring the Iraq War the folks you saw in a Baghdad or toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we had the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time so anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West's song\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kinda turned it into a thing and for ... for many couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a jolt and stuff you know ... those are the types of things that I was doing in in in Kanye West was at the forefront of my urbanized education\n[laughter] anyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for sure from

Tuesday nights\nAnd if it were at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a

at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you\nI'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and on that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are going to get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still bet\nYou have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way well I mean by anybody other than I have an idea I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place a morality to begin with\n...

George Bush doesn't like black people yes was mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact actually I went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nI was looking he'll look a gun you look at the teleprompter elected gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah\nAnd and that is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers\nPicks up and start treating the teleprompter and all the time of it anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success was somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThey can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a path and an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you how to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump\nNever forget\nI've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter] [laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going be [noise] I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh ended up getting a call and call came from government office during a unemployment verification jak verified the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place and I can tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nI was like OK gets off the bone and she tells me you know what to do just happen Senate making too much money single mother she's a single mother\nAnd she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now while I of course open change when it was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep all my government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping the economy that will not allow people tablet word mobility boom you're gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nBut what do you say\nYou see somebody like John Yang who obviously is not an ideologue ... not a Republican\nAt least not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "13"}
