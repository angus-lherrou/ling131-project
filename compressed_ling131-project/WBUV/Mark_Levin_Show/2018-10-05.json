I I think of volatility is opportunity\nRemember one of our real estate ... and the New Orleans area kinda says you know you make the money on the by I I feel that way about stocks also so the first indicator\nIs the ten year slashed two year treasury spread that is calculated by subtract thing the two year treasury note ill from the ten year treasury note ill the ten year to year treasury spread is helpful when estimating the next recession is\nLikely to occur\nSee there's the chart I was looking at that shows the inverted two year\nTo I'm Sorry ten year to year treasury spread leads to CBS ... the volatility index or the VIX by approximately three years if this historic relationship holds true we're about to experience a whole lot more volatility over the next few years\nI think for that is probably a little more that plays into it\nNow smart money and dumb money and the volatility index or VIX futures the smart money or commercial future Hedges had jurors\nWho tend to be right at market turning points are building up another bullish position and VIX futures just like they did a year ago head of the stock market correction and volatility spike\nIn addition we have the dumb money or large traders who tend to be wrong\nAt major turning points have built up large short positions like they did before early twenty eight team volatility spike the positioning of these groups of traders indicates that another volatility spike is likely ahead in the not too distant\nFuture does it mean is going to happen but you know you see these things and you say oh\nThis is something I Need to be aware of and that's what you're looking at it from a nation and data just because that has happened doesn't mean it will happen again but because that has happened you should be aware of it the volatility\nOf volatility is currently at unusually low levels once again [laughter] ... of volatility you know ... and look if they get credit we will start talking about again but it's been off our radar for a while which means that volatility is likely to pick up again soon\nVolatility typically moves in cycles periods of low volatility lead to much higher volatility and vice versa everything cyclic you've got a front end loader auto washing machine or just say you're drier and you've got a glass door\nGoat tape ... get you some skinny skinny blue tape ... tape across on it and watch how things cycle\nThe market does that to what's in favorite goes out of favor\nThen back in favor\nAs the whereas my next point here so the prospect\nOf volatility spike is quite alarming considering how inflated the stock market is volatility spikes typically occur as a result of bearish stock market action instead of bully\nAction [noise]\nAnd you know we just ran out of time I've got a couple more points but I tell you what we're going to pick this up once again and add it to our Saturday morning lists\nAt ten o'clock by if you have the need for a financial advisor I recommend Gregory Rick's founder and CEO Gregory rights and associates go to Gregory ... for a three to nine to zero zero I'm James Parker we are winning it life with Gregory ...

wholly within the realm of the United States Senate even the house can't get involved in it\nOr to his credit\nOr Mitch McConnell does know how to work the Senate floor and he does know how what the

the Three Stooges of the Republican Party\nUm ah Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake because even now even though that they got the FBI report that they want it\nEven though two of them said it was full some or even now they're playing games and so these are very very principled or individuals in those three\nAnd what they're really wing here ladies and gentlemen as their own political

I've got it set up said\nOn Saturday So I'm doing this you should learn how do you want to suggest one thing about senators I'm Murkowski and Collins and like\nI have a feeling that they are going to vote for a Kavanaugh and they've already made up by their minds but by by not shifting their hand at this point the Republicans are putting maximum pressure\nOn voters Democrats\nRunning for the Senate\nIn states that Trump won\nYou know this makes a ton of sense assuming Collins and flake and Murkowski are playing ball you think they're playing ball\nThink that they are a luxury why don't you looked at the report and a flake in college like they are on record saying vicious vicious\nNow during the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate tradition\nCommittee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters of face violence and violence threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement a response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional at times I'd rather my tongue was sharp and I said a few things they should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband dad and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic and the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming up the day that has gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe than it independent and impartial judiciary is essential direct constitutional republic\nIf confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind and every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law Brett Kavanaugh\nTo beautiful up it won't matter one with the Democrats or the media and the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kid George parents\n[noise] [noise]\nOh several times the judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\n\nThe reason he's hated by the less the reason is under attack by the Democrats the reason the media went would gossip and rumor\nAnd really defamation is because his declared support for the constitution they do not support it they do not support the constitution except both take the free press part because they think it protects them\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists and ... ... you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and in trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThen we just as Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talk about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott they must ... plus and they must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case that Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it the case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion it's not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nThat's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual in states\nWell that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's because judge Kavanaugh revere as the constitution not just the name but an action as he declares that he is despise and he is hated because that's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the more he is despised I'll be right back [noise] was\nHim news radio ...\n\nVery for a vote I'm rich Dennison Fox

in God's image everyone has an alien I'm All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do the ale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward a morality and toward God and we ...\nWe share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our entire a constitutional\nFramework is based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even

you're right in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down\nOr you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that uh and uh and and you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing\nAnd uh and you raised a point earlier when we were talking a and the first segment\nAnd that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation I think people need to understand or is that\nThe men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth would the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't us tablets your religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion so in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that affected the states and so well people may say well I'm an atheist well I\nI you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I ... and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of safe were they not\nYes and and that's been documented in and a lot of people wanted the rock that because\nIt has any interest of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendencies of the left\nAs Obama tried to
