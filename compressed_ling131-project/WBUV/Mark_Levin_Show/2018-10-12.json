{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "... maybe ... ... I'm a single I maybe forty grand a year I\nI own maybe twenty five left on my home I didn't know whether to\nGo to overeat or refinance or reverse mortgage\nOr event um if I start collecting my Social Security or and and then go back to work part time or if I wait until I'm ... ... talking about it\nAnd I might have maybe thirty five granted my four one K. but I Do have my mother living with me\nAnd he had a little bit of money that way that like a couple of grant and yeah but I that of course well so I I don't know what\nSo are you working now\nYet full time\nFull time how long do you plan to keep working\nWell I I figured I work full time and talent that couple of years and then I Try to go into part time\nAnd when I started collecting Social Security which would only be maybe Fifteen hundred dollars a month but if I waited tell I'm Seventy I looked out\nYeah that's pretty good increase their yeah you can you continue to work to Seventy do you think I'm\nTaking it day by day\nAnd I hear you okay going back to your four one K. you have about thirty five thousand\nCorrect and I got about a hundred and twenty at my work part time you know I as far as what I owe on it\nSo you over a hundred and twenty thousand own your home\nNo I I had I only twenty five I my mom and dad were about a hundred or almost paid off\nSo when when do you see that mortgage going away at what age\nUm well the Senate try to try to read\nFinanced it right now the thirty year make I Will go down a little ... and that may be double up on it if I could I just don't know what struck up because I think all that did I don't have the house that you know I I ... my mom\nAnd eat healthier than I Am practically in eighty seven that runs in our family\nThat happens let's talk about your ex spouse is then where are you married for ten years\nNow I've been married a couple of ... about that for over ten years\nSo she ... ten years in that case your mom's probably got another good ten years you can expect that money and it might get used for her health care is time continues on march at sea savings how much do you have\nEmergency about three grant\nThree ground so when you mentioned that you might refinance your house and that's going and doing a thirty year mortgage again well I Wish I Would that cost you a month so ... what is your monthly payment actually right now\nWell with insurance and everything it eighty a month now I have been talking a blank time because I Want it and wire battery or or it but I didn't know pilots white there yet\nSo what is your age now again it's more here here's my thinking a reverse mortgage can make the ballots go away but I Would rather you hold off until you actually\nYou retire because when we're looking at your streams of income you've got thirty five thousand that's not going to go along wise that's only going to create small amount of income from their Social Security would be income stream too and then to reverse mortgage you\nKnow let's just say the houses paid off its worst hundred and fifty thousand I think reversible and once again ... ... you get more out of it the older you are so I I Would ... I really think about doing the reverse until it's at\nRetirement time whether it sixty six or sixty eight\nOr sub and the because that's another source of income and really one of the your best benefit is real right here what's the best thing you can do work till eight Seventy cars you maximize that benefit you'll get more out of the reverse\nAs well and you're four one K. will be larger that's going to give you the best opportunity for success if you can go that far\nAnd and that's what I uh I I all the time and that's what I learned and I think I'm going the right track\nI understand that that's why I gave you really great advice here and I don't know about this going create another thirty year mortgage or something like that now we need to get rid of the debt and get your position\nFor a reverse that turns on income and then you might inherits money later we can't count on that but we know you've got three sources of income so keep working and keep building that up all your numbers are improving every year and keep listening\nAll right we're back alive now\nA what a preview a little bit of what's coming up on Saturday show the Saturday spectacular we do three hours of this program or from ten to one every Saturday our guest Wes Blanchard he's the estate planning attorney of the total wealth authority of Gregory rates and associates or\nAnd we're also going to talk about the demise of a great American brand ... our old buddies over its ears looks like they are on the cusp of a bankruptcy filing the rumor mill is flying around and uh we'll see if this company is about to go away in pretty fast fashion here\nBecause it could come as soon as maybe tomorrow there's there's a debt payment that students beginning next week is it's due on Monday and if they're going to want to escape that without any more problems are going to have to go ahead and pull the trigger\nOn a that bankruptcy filing yikes scary stuff huh\nHey there was a miracle to tell you about\n\n[noise] ever since we cancelled the space shuttle program here in America and NASA said yeah you know we've been running this thing since Nineteen eighty one or whenever it started and we're just not going to do it anymore well there's one and only one way to get astronauts to the space station and that's through the soil uses capsules\nAnd the irony here is it just plain deafening hang on a second\nSo the previous administration cancelled the space shuttle program we don't have shuttles going up there 'cause it's too old to this thing's been running since like Nineteen eighty Nineteen eighty one well\nThis the soil use space capsule\nWas originally designed and it's still following the basic function the basic blueprint\nOf the original so use going back to the sixties so we have a technology that's actually Fifteen Years older than the ... technology we just jettison because it was too old no pun intended on jettisoned them just beautiful coincidence so we had a\nWe had a mission to take an American astronaut Nick cake and a Russian astronaut Alexi of chin in ocean and\nSorry my Russians all rusty so\nThey were jumped in the soil you space craft or with some supplies and it was taken off and it went through the first segment and when the second booster rocket was supposed to\nUh take off it just\nSort of blew up off the back of the Soyuz capsule and there's video of this and you don't really know what's going on from the distance from the outside but you do kind of see a puff of smoke and you're like huh\nThat doesn't look right well then they show the the picture from inside the capsule and you see the American in the Russian next to each other and they're strapped down\nBut they are strapped down as they are they are bouncing all over the place it was just shaking them violently and they have all these nylon straps over their arms and legs and everything so they're they're basically they can't move but like a half inch in any direction but you see I'm shaking\nAnd to the emergency protocol immediately kicked in the soil used turned around after it was about they say it was fifty kilometers up I have no idea what that is was that like thirty miles\nUp in the air so\nI mean is on the cusp of the atmosphere it has to turn around and immediately make reentry and it was a little bit of a tough re entry there\nThey said they were feeling forces up to seven gee the a spacecraft guide itself back down to an empty step in Kazakhstan where the parachutes deployed and the guys came out unscathed um I Know\nThe news here on whether or not they soiled their drawers that if I had been one of those ... uh we we definitely would've needed a clean\nUp there [noise] but I guess it's not their time to go what is your time to go it's

they for hanging out your own way from the show when you get life dot com and the winning a life that I'm James Parker we are winning it life with Gregory ... [noise]\n[noise] from them and do you see in the studios [noise] this is talk for nine point and I heard\nOf destruction I leave ... Fox News this storm is gone to clean up on your way in the Florida Panhandle one day after hurricane Michael made landfall Fox's ... has more lie\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser instead George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then\nThere wasn't a black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards Scalia was what happens when negroes don't read I\nThink about that\nKanye West is what happens\nNegroes don't read I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car sellers now in ... west said this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when negroes don't read snow you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou won't get what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say they say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in the schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public edge ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it so impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery and\nSo what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro\n\nWho went from living on the plantation miss producer once you play that audio again this is Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation\nThen the ... comes out in ... and start singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm saying are kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\n\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there don't you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id\nHow races has that mentality\nAnd then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I'm going to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate in all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs the African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist because it's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's treats or ... or ... horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this being national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and that we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is\n\nDon't tell me that the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery\nYou shut up you sit down in the back of our black bus and our black party in our Democratic Party and you say what we tell you to say\nAnd what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane if you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for yourself or have independent thoughts we will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit\nYou're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you've been to a hospital before for mental health issues\nClearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the\nWay you're an ignorant black person\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is that is your Democratic Party that's exactly what they say if you leave their democratic plantation now\nI'll be happy to hear you tell me how I'm wrong now I Would love for you to tell me why it's appropriate because a black man disagrees with the Democratic black party and walks off their democratic plantation and actually start to say things that makes sense about the reality of the economy\nHow this isn't shaming bullying racism\nHow this is I mean the same party that says I again it's coming out day come out love everybody saying well what everybody let's support all the gay lesbian transgender demise sexual but ah we also got a rip on a black man today who went and became a Republican\nTell you what is what happens when they grow don't read and then we'll say they ignorant because he can't even read\n\nOne eight seven seven three eight one

F.\nAnd what a county I say today can we can we play that this is what ... said in the White House replayed it in the first hour I'm not afraid of it I don't think the Kanye West a rapper who drops the M. F. word a lot was going to somehow changes tune with the president here's what he had to say today\nThat's not worrying about the future all we really have is today we just have the day over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and Trump for his on his hero's journey\nRight now and he might not have expected to have a crazy mother Kanye West's run up and are so poor\n\nDon't ... don't forget Kanye West also is that an educated black man now because he's supporting Trump\nScalia was what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mythic pictures [laughter]\n[laughter] I must say and black folks aren't that to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay\nThey've had it with him and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the models spokes person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized he's already been hospitalized hospitalized\nHe's already been hospitalized so we're going to slander do because he doesn't agree with us want to eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven wants to get to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and I get drawn excellence dropped thrown into mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody abuses that were going on\nAnd some of the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all the sudden I seem to have like thought disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places even though some of the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of a history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention months\nAnd I think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't that day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything out there must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just it just so people know that we were when we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say that says where's the compassion and and I\nSay this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nA black man a ... and there and he's taking advantage abusing him by putting them out there today\nNo one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was the narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the mark of an show Ben Fergus and we didn't go ahead\nYou're still in my son or about the uh\nUh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of the hit that um they check this out so now Herschel walkers it'll be the next token negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but as a whole nother thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first she's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but

ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here today to seek out and destroy people when we think about the ... district

you are the ones that we create the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise has to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible that they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have
