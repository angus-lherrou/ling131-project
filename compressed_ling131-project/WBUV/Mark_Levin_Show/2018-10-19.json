say you did it well qualified money I don't want those distributions re invested\nIn additional shares of the non tradable read I Would rather that money go elsewhere you're already and do something different there so there is risk to that the values could go down it may not be liquid\nAnd that's something you have to understand 'cause you know what's rule number three that I have the return of

you get in it not what the return is not even what the detail oh you can get in on yeah All right they're not allowing that with a nun tradable means there's an exit problem well you've heard some of the worst case scenarios where you just can't get your money out\nOh we've seen so many of them over the years in regard to\nThey're not like an income or the income has stopped\nYou know typically the plans for them is to be able to buy you out of your ... and put you in another one back and let's see when did we last use those I may be\nEarly to thousands maybe it was right before to the house and good ways back we were using those as an income tool because of the amount of income they would pay out you know say six seven or eight percent back then it was a nice stream\nAnd it was you know set up safe for five years and the one we were using back then that we lie was there were backed up by real estate that\nWere used for post offices so you could go back Twenty years and I'm pretty sure that's what it was late nineties you go back in the late nineties and think gosh that's pretty south post office is going to go anywhere is it\n... people are always gonna have to send letters everybody's going to need to send letters through their overnight through the post office get their ... pictures\nAnd shipping or you know it's just that was the thing everybody does and heck back then I went to the post office often several times a week in fact\nAnd the client says as well so that was like a great tool to use and and that was but one of the cycles through that I realized that gosh this liquidation phase is taking longer than the previous time\nFor the clocks to get their money out and at that point I think there was like a year delay because what they're doing is is they're wanting to sell out the next ... or the problem is the real estate smelt worth more it's worth\nBless us so they're having trouble with the portfolio which creates a liquidation problem

... thousand dollars and I'm from that point on everything is just going to be gravy\nThe ... you know you just use the word hopefully yeah that sounds good to be true to me\nIt sounds like a non treatable read and you know if everything goes well you're getting earnings you're having those reinvest it in and hopefully everything goes well\nAnd basically they're buying you out cashing you out to do it again and create the fees and the turnover windows don't go well you're setting for a while without your money and they might even stop the\nInterest payments that sure read the pot pausing for more shares that\nHopefully you'll get out and then what happens from that point at some point it because it's going to go to a market security and then\nThere will be traded on the market for its true value which usually when that happens a lot of times it's less than what you put in we've seen so many of these over the past decade since the great recession that all these didn't work out well the last time\nI used a non ... was back in the late nineties\nAnd we were doing that with clients and it was basically back was post offices\nAnd I didn't like the feeling I was getting back then so we unwound that for clients\nAnd have it done non tradable reach sense so just make sure you're clear owned the risks than in ... because of the hopefully thing kind of told me everything I needed to know\nTheir rule number three Gregory the return of your money is more important than the return on your money\nThat question right does that help you out map\nIt does and then I guess my father question is are are we at a new thing I haven't traditionally you know followed that up I have a traditional four one K.\nThrough work that has been you know doing well for me I've done a couple of

[noise]\nFrom them and don't view it GMC studios [noise] this is talk for nine points and I urge radio station\n[noise]\nSeeing their own investigation nine ... Fox News Saudi Arabia now says they're looking into that is the parents and journalist your mouth can show me last seen three weeks ago and during the valley consulate in Istanbul\nThese illegal immigrants from coming across into this country that will cause the southern border to protect our nation's interests\nAnd and it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean there's just no different than putting a lock on your door having a fence around your house\nHaving a a a worm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from art before or many that know me I I play tennis in college I was almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a nother nation they both came to this country as a student with a student visa legally\nThey didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with it\nEvil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using his compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\n\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage left on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands is a terrible person they should come down and should be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of adding to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and have so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not and realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they are like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal\nYou still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and it's taken a life ... because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must\n... where I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like\nHow Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can land we also need a place\nThat we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast to know how Donald Trump's villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use a\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they are better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant Caribbean are legal immigrants heading nights it's America is what the president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome all breakers you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what is it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media do they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great fence\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump hug\nWon eight seven seven three one thirty\nEight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight

destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\n\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit\nA five hundred dollars that six thousand a year under new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Camilla hairs of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\n\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is a lie\nAre working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she said that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in her own words is why\nI'm not going to focus on that for ... that's that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey\nFrom the website bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rates survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings aid rely on in an emergency\n\nSo what you have is you have come out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darned phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we're seeing record numbers will fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how warped this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase a medical bill or childcare so she wants to give you a government subsidized money so that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nThat my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody\nWho's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I said it's number correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for a five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you\nYou just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMemory when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away\nGo work at the stats\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month\nOn average the idea that\nSomeone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year that they're now going to save that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\n\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about\n... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the craft or spend their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making the year ... is just liberal and competency at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks\nI don't have it my dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example and I had a\nTire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math\n... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me in fact I Hope she would say I'm embarrassed by you you're an embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes\nThis is nothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently\nIn that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people cash because they're not getting the food stamps anymore so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to you that's what you got to do just get

things but I studied it for three years down here I live in his eye that a victim of a six years ago there are thousands of cases that are coming that don't even make it to the book\nWhere I had one call in my house that night that hand and almost killed me that aren't even making it to the court system I beg President Trump to listen to all of taxes that they are they are pouring over the

cautious about it because I think that we were in trouble or just from not paying attention\nOr people feel secure in and I I Try to explain this the other day on TV I said the reason why Democrats are doing well is because there is mad as we were when Obama was in office at the end right and yeah so they're furious there to fever pitch\nA lot of people if you've got if you feel like things are under control and Donald trumps the president and you feel good about it and you feel like he's doing a good job and doing the right thing and wives getting good and you can enjoy life you're not as focused because you're not married you're not frustrated\nI I Believe that Ted Cruz was in serious trouble from just lack of of enthusiasm because people feel secure it they were comfortable and how things are going in Texas how things were going in Washington with Donald Trump being the president and now\nUh because of the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh because Democrats have already set in their campaigning on you give us the control the house for the Senate we will impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump\nIs re engage the base and fire them up and that's why you're going to

I mean we could take cruises a perfect example of this better race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nOh absolutely absolutely\nAnd and you could argue that there there there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never gonna win California well if you can turn\nTexas to them for the Dems those three states ...\nIt's virtually impossible to do math that makes it were Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California the same exact way by the way we've got some\nVery important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentator she was just on MSNBC deadline White House\nAnd she had some very insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal of the day with some great advice and analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nMeans doing that the scare journalist care who he called me the people as we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was badly of pets and and\nHe doesn't respond why I'm sure that's what drew me to think what could he possibly do to their journalism not printing bad news about it which is also equivalent to the truth about\nSo now Donald Trump wants to kill American journalists\nPer Rosie o'donald\nAnd doesn't want to stay and wants to scare journalists oh Donald says he's doing that to scare every journalist here who he calls enemy of the people\nAs we all know he's doing that here's a guy who is who was tortured and killed a journalist and this is Donald Trump's wet dream to scare all journalists the same way\nThat I didn't spy or you know and I I don't know what I can do I'm done Marco then we'll be back with you on Monday it's always great to spend some time with you if you want to follow me on Facebook and Twitter bent Ferguson show have a great night\nSwing me\nKelly Bennett from Gulf has mornings with uncle Henry wake up with this weekday morning six days and has a smell to it I Would agree with that so [noise] lick the only really gotten to the point where we got to tell people\nYou might not want to dress up as a Nazi for Halloween\nKnow exactly what they totally\nBecause we've gotten into situations where males\nAs a Native Americans for example\nGulf Coast morning with Kelly Bennett and they'll go and read with traffic in whether to gather on the nine ... every weekday find Utah\nW.

Fox News ... during the refugees are making their way through Central America hoping to reach the U.S southern border now reportedly in agreement with Mexico to try and stop\nThe the senior administration official tells Fox News\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... a alarm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from art before a mini that know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\nMy best friend\nIs from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country as a student\nWith a student visa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house 'cause I Want your\nTV I'm not going to go buy my own the president's tweet today was what a strong advocate for a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them\nHe said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it it it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're\nOut there will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words member don't trust them into action not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\n\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and is an outrage left on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should come down and should be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is if you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of adding to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy any meaning evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered I also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not and realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited driving Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal\nYou still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet as part of punishment they will give lashing\nTo old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth and I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with\nSaudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with\nHuman rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must\nWere I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake\nOutrage I don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know\nWhy we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other boats agrees that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong this there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be\nOne eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are in most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use\nA I Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they are better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed but make\nNo mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant Caribbean are legal immigrants heading nights it's America is what a president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome operate because you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what is it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media do they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great fence\nWith big doors opening those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump hug\nWon eight seven seven\nThree one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight
