{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "That you want that you want it to be instead of have all this worry and having to carry everything that's why we want to give you information so you can make better decisions going forward\nGreat James Oh absolutely hated why we're here so we do the six days a week [noise] so what do the numbers it's some much better day to\nDay yesterday\nWelcome to the number segment where we give you a snapshot of what happened in the financial world while you were out today winning it live\nFollow along on the exact same charts and graphs we're looking at good winning it life dot com or download the winning it life that suitable numbers page there and you can see a lot of green across indices the Dow Jones was at one point six percent has to be at one point nine percent NASDAQ up almost three whole percent\nAnd the Russell was up to point two percent now these aren't big enough numbers to make up\nThe horrible losses that we saw the day before meeting yesterday still a step in the right direction Gregory has our debt instruments\nOh interest rates went up just light only from beginning to end of the day we finished up at three point one one seven percent on tenure treasuries where'd crude oil finishes sixty six dollars and\nEighty three cents we had a Brent Crude move you know the separate a little bit remember we yesterday you talked about it narrowed between Brent Crude and crude oil Brent Crude closed at Seventy six dollars\nAnd fifty two sets gold ticked up a little bit where one thousand two hundred and thirty three dollars and Seventy cents silver did alone will pull back from yesterday's number fourteen\nDollars and sixty four sets you know one of the questions and I let me see where\nAm I here ... my chart\nThere we go so one of the questions we had yesterday from\nA listener using the winning at life out and\nWe're asking like when is this market going to stop the bleeding so to speak when does it kind of stop going down\nThat may have been today\nI wanted to say that last night but\nYou know what's you know I was talking about decisions that you have to\nIt could have done some by and they could have done some buying yesterday that's scary day to do buying but didn't do any buying today but\nWhat I wanted was more for ... and so I think tomorrow's important as well as Monday's imported days but every day going forward is about decisions for me as a money manager\nAs well it's different from\nClients they're really depended upon me to do that day traders are probably looking at every minutes a decision well we don't look at things that way we don't look at things as a permanent by on hold but we do try to look beyond\nToday and it depends on what's going on\nBeyond now\nAnd that can give us so a lot that goes out several days several weeks or maybe a month but I it's kind of like cars are well how's November going to\nBe hopefully good one of the things that there was some numbers I had here let me see if I have a ... grew up my phone here and see if a promotion to my finger tips\nFor\nIf you go to your focus [noise] since Nineteen\nFifty there have been sub in other years that were positive year to date going into October and so the S. and P. five hundred turn negative year today during\nOctober the good news is that the final two months were higher six times and a four point one percent on average so you know what that gives us hope\nA pattern so high\nPercentage high probability the rest of this year's going to finish up from here\nAnd the average was four point one percent so we might not get all those gains that we've had for the year but it's it should be positive six out of the seven times that this of that\nHas happened so water important number say on the\nS. and P. five hundred to the lower side we have to be concerned about twenty six sixty seven we have to be concerned about twenty six fifty three that it is probably an important level to hold on the upside can we break through\nTwenty seven twenty six and go on up through twenty seven thirty two you know so those those are breakthroughs your you know what I'm really talking about we need to hold that certain levels and it would be good to hold where we're at\nOn the S. and P. and that's as well as other indexes and move up now we're not going to move straight up and recovered this remember\nHigher highs higher lows because it's going to move up ... then it's going to pull back but we don't want it to go as low as last time and moved back up so that's what we're watching far\nAs the indexes go and the position that positions that you lie\nWe're hoping that you're getting that type of momentum as well and that's part of the decision making process or we have an momentum in our favor\nWhat did the technical tell you is their support and are we getting symmetry moving up so that you can make some good decision so that's how we look at it\nSo the big winner on the short she today is Tesla and this is an after hours number they were up for a second there\nUh over Seventeen percent it's back down to about Fifteen and a half percent and the green and they had a great earnings report you know they um they beat basically on everything but monthly users revenue was above ...\n... that's a Tesla him and say Twitter okay I I thought we were still I'm ... I'm Sorry\nIf I sat tests on Twitter but Twitter's didn't want to these is that it's been really hard to press the poll profit and like Tesla surprises yesterday with their first profit\n... I mean a Twitter starting to make some money to bang having troubles as me love me so they uh their earnings per share was Twenty one since they were expected to bring in fourteen cents per share\nBut I'm\nWorldwide growth is good ... United States revenue as good as a ... in total is up twenty nine percent year over year so that's strange to see them making money but they're doing well and that's a huge number for the short cheat\n[noise] yeah there was a oh gosh we're out of time gosh us going to say so many things we shop fide jumped ... percent after post surprised profit Callaway golf this golf a share ... five percent after beat hey golf Amazon letters Amazon\nSource ahead of earnings I'm\nSorry links home builder but I'm\nThe same as ... but Amazon\nStock drops own holiday forecast shows record profit but their forecast kind of wanted to tone things down ... gains are better than expected earnings see who else intel rallies more than five percent alphabet stock falls after earning beat\nRevenue ... earnings beat but revenue mess snap\nStock falls after user counts slips again but financial beat there's you know a lot of mixture here Expedia share shut my point four percent ... they're lower today\nMattel beat source up and we're about out of time hey if you'd like some more of this ...\nType of conversation that we've had here on the show than I I have a daytime job financial advisor fiduciary money manager [noise] help find where you are on the path Gregory rex dot com phone number ... for eight three two Ninety two hundred [noise]\nYou're on the way from the show when you get life dot com and the winning it life that go there you can listen to live check out all their pod fast connect to Gregory is also son James Parker we are when you get live with Gregory Rick [noise]\nFrom\nThem and do you see in the studios he's talking for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nSearch area I'm Lisa ... Fox News federal and local authorities now looking at Florida as an area of interest as they hunt for the person or persons responsible the series of suspected bombs sent to several high profile Democrats and the other day one was founded dressed actor Robert Deniro package\nMarco Rubio can't remember them all\nIt's just hard to to to ignore the fact that all these examples I gave you before\nIt ... wasn't that they were downplayed it was that they weren't really covered in any several why were they\n\nAll these packages going to the Trump family all these packages going to the Pentagon Madison so forth are to Rubio or other members here and they're\nNot ... I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't a minister producer there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Ford incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words in Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the president does that any politician does\nNational Cuba's radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute NBA just spend an hour talking about it you can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we\nHave thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company where the hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio what do you have a government radio in a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rice in attacks against Republican Senator Susan Collins right after she voted for cabinet other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief for the navy center the president of the United states white powder scent the members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\n\nNow why does all this matter it matters\nBecause the media are out there trying to determine who politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damn thing it's the most grotesque good\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now\nI Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL us the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear makeup but you're also going to hear a never Trump or probably denies he's never Trump or John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do her CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann Hi Adam in hiding them in any way a\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called network cut five go\nBut I Do now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that top Democrats in the navy I Would think targeted this is an unusual kind of ...\nGo ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame comes on the president's rhetoric ... stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay moron in some sense it's okay you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary written much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner you go ahead\n... costs us I think when you have a rhetoric of a kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nThis is a price on that his call the navy or the enemy of painful and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and the federal judge was murdered I remember that ... that assassination attempt on her and it\nTurns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media and then you\nOr your cost the enemy of the people want to call for an off the enemy of the pie but what what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever is it a part of this and is being treated as an enemy is\nGoing to act like [laughter] to see me so I Know where she will be complicit\nIn ... oh so\nHe is complicit let ... let a disgraceful for really to get face time on MSNBC they'll do anything what a disgrace what a disgraceful group of clowns here we have this\nGoing on in the country and its Trump and Trump they're obsessed ... make and ... and ... Ratner and I don't even they are just obsessed with Trump\nIncredible go ahead\nFor leadership find have given the fact that the president has seen them for two years not interested in trying to detox five environments rather for jobs away and fall and the fire at every opportunity\nIt's no longer okay to say now [noise] to not answer questions and I think\nShut up you idiot and how do you think your age no longer okay to say nothing to answer the questions that are not speaking so Trump is guilty ladies and gentlemen he's an accomplice he's aiding and abetting some domestic terrorists\nNot a credible\nMSNBC now MSNBC which has a high tolerance for violent outrageous\nPoisonous language where the president's call her a racist whereas compared to Hitler whereas compared to\nStalin NBC MSNBC\nThey just gave the boot to Megan Kelly\nAnd they claim it's because of her reference to Blackfish she didn't make a racial\nAttack on anybody I'm not defending it I'm just saying she did it it's not like she's joy you read you know smash\nMouth and gay smash mouthing other people who by the way keeps our job but we're there to MSNBC it's not like she made the most viral anti\nSemitic comments like Al Sharpton one of their weekend host no no no no and she apologized she all but cry she was cheering over to apologize right\n\nBut they're pushing her out the door they're pushing out the door because they don't want her anymore and they're using this to push her out the door this was NBC which at a high tolerance level for Matt Lauer\n\nNot not a special leader for anybody I'm just making the point what a what a disgusting joke this corporation is NBC MSNBC Comcast the whole damn bunch\nBut to have these people sit there right in the middle one the FBI and the the counter terrorism task\nForce and the others are trying to figure out who did what and sober it's Trump Trump Trump Trump\nDiscovered it narrows tobacco production house was noticed by a retired police officer turned security guard who thought it looked the same as the ones he saw on TV and X ray revealed a pipe bomb with similar packaging to the other nine cents a democratic figures\nBut the two bombs intended for vice president Joe Biden never left the U.S postal service facilities in Maryland where they were flagged and collected as the search continues authorities are warning civilians across the country to be on high alert\nNone of the explosives reached their intended targets but several were handled by civilian boxes\nJackie Heinrich in New York City a direct message to the thousands of migrants heading to the U.S from President Trump\nPresident Trump tweeted Thursday to those in the caravan turnaround we are not letting people in the United states illegally go back to your country but the migrants are coming there walking through southern Mexico the some are taking buses and others are preparing to take a train when asked what they plan to tell border officials when they arrive some weren't sure\nThey were there for a look and I have no idea only that I'm going to be kept on going to work to get ahead\nAccording to a senior defense official the Pentagon's drawing up plans to send as many as eight hundred troops to the border a combination of reserve and active duty engineers and medical staff to support the border patrol\nBoxes Jessica Rosenthal homeland security secretary here's the Nielsen had this to say\nThey are truly fearing for their lives and they're being persecuted they don't need to get to the United states should be taking recognition Mexico on\nFox is the story with Martha ...

need to dial down to the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making sure in a less less safe\nIs the rhetoric the incense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks waiting in the mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nMeeting up on the media and also just sort of this violent rhetoric calling Democrats a mob of saying that they support and that Thirteen incremental [noise] um I'm kind of radical endanger is in such a staple of the way they have talks about on his opponents and you know\nI ... did they do any of this when all that rice center would be powder was being sent to Republicans to the Trump family to Trump\nTo ... to ... to Rubio\nOr when ... was shot in the middle of a baseball field did you hear any of this any of these recriminations about the Democrats and Bernie Sanders and the left and and\nHow they're just too aggressive any recriminations about lack black lives matter or or antifa or even going back to the Obama holder administration where they were trashing the cops on what took place in Baltimore and other cities and

now\nLook he calls you fake news I Would say you're full of crap news quite frankly I think the president really let you off the hook he calls you've fake news it's a passive\nTerm it's a relatively nice term you know your fake fake effective if he doesn't call you align pack rats you could do that\nBut he hasn't done that\nAnd the irony is even while you're attacking him your proving his point aren't you the bubble people they live in their own bubble go ahead\nOf the rhetoric of a push back then the president's why has any has Trump hold anybody\nIn the media Hitler many in the media call

time\nYou're liable to listen to her show would be the lungs groceries [noise]\nYou're a buddy Andy McCarthy [noise] who's actually one of the few people who's prosecuted and incitement case that is solicitation to commit a crime of violence\nIt's written a piece of National Review online he says it may be a great political talking point to blame violence some provocative village [noise]\nMaybe a poll test well but the accusation would be left at a laugh out of a courtroom if you leave political narrative and cross into your real world effects evidence and the wisdom of everyday experience here's what you know you hear a barn burner of his speech maybe get your riled up maybe or move to work harder to feed your political opponents but\nPeople do not leave a political rally sang to themselves what he said about those bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong uses\nLot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy it's a sign of the times a reflection of the course of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners to go with it\nThat was more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as fighting words that is given a been given minimal constitutional protection because apparently insults and insights\nLet's see but I Do not mean to suggest that it is inconceivable\nThat any but the most palpable incitement could ever be actionable\nIf politicians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically accountable regardless whether the circumstances\nAllow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing spree because of something heard at a political rally no normal person has moved a murder because he hears an ideological firebrand demonize his opponents people who engage in mass murder and other forms of terrorism or either committed to a violent movement\nOr mentally disturbed in either advantages that attributable to political rhetoric free speech media\nNow bill airs memory bill airs remember

remember how we were condemned by the media heirs and\nDarn actually involved in violence with people laughter people dismiss that\n\nTrump hasn't done a damn thing that would result in what's taking place here\nNot once in his life\nAnd his wife he doesn't have friends like that he doesn't have associates like that Obama did talk about that I'd say any\nIncredible isn't it\nIt's outrageous that's not Trump's pedigree he didn't hang around with people like that Obama hung around with people like that and nobody gave a damn\nCertainly not in the media they didn't give a damn got a complete pass\nNow I'm\nRemembering when comedy was great to watch these comedy shows tonight\nI don't know what's funnier MSNBC and CNN or these clowns at night because none of them are funny but remember

Fox News federal and local authorities zeroing in on one state as they hunt for the person or persons responsible for ten suspected bombs at the high profile Democrats and other\nInvestigators are now describing Florida as a region of interests this is the FBI refined to search for the origin of some of those suspicious packages containing possible pipe bombs all intercepted in several states\nDon't need to use a week\nAs part of an element and making gasoline for your car and for most cars\nIt's very damaging\nSo basically we're subsidizing seizing people who are\nWho produce this that and we don't need it the environmental issues to push it now they backed off and they say hey you know what your ... your great more pollution or using as an all creating as at all then you don't the point is we don't need it anymore so why should the federal government impose Fifteen Percent ethanol in fuel\nAnd it's been a big push by the left all these years now because it was done for eight months a year to make it a twelve month issue that is the sale of eat Fifteen ethanol blend all year round not just for eight months\n\nWhile the Democrats didn't do this they Trump administrators and did all three of these things\nAll three of these things\nFord Motor company which I guess we're supposed to hate now has said that US Steel costs more than anywhere else in the world they're spending an extra one billion dollars on manufacturing automobiles and you can see right now automobile sales are flat for new automobile\nBecause the prices are going up several thousands of dollars\n\nSo millions and millions of people are affected by that and they don't even know it same with refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\n\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that as a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going I support the American worker I support the American consumer I support the American economy America First means capitalism first\n\nPark I don't believe in free free markets pure free markets well nobody does because we don't have them and we've never had them but that doesn't mean you embrace these Bernie Sanders ... not so good drugs\n\nThe president's put out a dictate it's not even legal\n\nHe's put out a dictator through the department of ah what do they call health and Human Services\n\nThey want price transparency I don't have a problem with that\nWe all want price transparency but when they do the price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all show us the taxes\nShow us the costs so much they are indeed that went into that particular Madison\nNo other word you want transparency thing give it all you must solve the trans parents that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cures for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dementia and Alzheimer's the amount of money that's being spent to try and find cures for diabetes and so forth money's being spent over and over again and really\nIn many ways or at least in some ways it's been quite beneficial

Samaras Fox News Florida now considered to read you an entrenched as federal and local authorities continue who investigated theories of suspected bombs into high profile Democrats and others one today found in New York City a pledge\nGoes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger ... said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses Mahler investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nThe DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen\nThe initial appeal was filed five days later stay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\n\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone file a motion to quash or otherwise resisted the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nIt's unclear whether the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all\nMr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making and professor caliber ISI has made\n\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority and legal legitimacy before a judge is relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but all the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the hardier tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer and the Russian inquiry to recall the case from a previous investigation\nWhere you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because it was under steal All right\n\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller I counsel as I said they questioned the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause in the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so\nWho knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court and despite\nWhat you've heard by senior traditional analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and robbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler and this is why these two questions are important stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nOr is he an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in fear officer who reports to deputy attorney general Rosen steam\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy to an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial appointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that\nSo this isn't like Mars and versus ... now the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd eyes more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is uh is going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activists\nSo

taking place in Florida and the Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRun to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um Tallahassee\nIs a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arrange a number of excursions one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who had kind of own infiltrated\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the\nPlay Hamilton I mean people hear about these Campbell to pick a day to go to the movie the tickets were at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that injures lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that\nBut then those same lobbyist also arranged\nA luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up costing about a thousand dollars a for Andrew and his wife a an addition to some other folks and the getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for it so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby is God a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted\nIs denial showed he was lying\nUm and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line is the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart and the law you understand the stuff\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that the only reason you would do such an act\nOf course nobody knows the peace in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people him\nOh it's it's ... it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean by that\nMuch history there um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said you know ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value
