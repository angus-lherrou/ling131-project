{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "But that's that is kind of weird 'cause you just have to have all this trust but it's got to be in a city where the road drawl mouth stripes and everything's everywhere 'cause it's it's looking for all those\nThings\nTo know where to go help\nKeep it in the line the GPS to tell where it's going also but there's a reason for those stripes and all in the road meant not curves in\nMy brain just viscerally rejects the idea of a car without a staring will just because I've never seen one couldn't imagine never had to imagine one before they're even really been presented to even think about it like this you know my first reaction\nIs well that wouldn't you like it there for backup or in case you do need it or the self driving thing breaks down or whatever but hang on if it's going to be autonomous and self driving\nAnd it doesn't have a steering wheel you know you don't need you don't need that whole little steering column that goes you don't eat it actually physically connected to the axle you can take out the actual manual driving mechanisms and probably have use a lot less room and in a way less than it will be less to build because you don't you don't need that extra component\nThen they're starting to make more sense if I can just digest it for a few more minutes\nBut you said they're doing something about a remote control yet they're lying or they're looking at some options here so and I taught him his car one\nThing you you would do is you would either have an app on your phone like an ... ... ... where you put it into the address and you send it to your car that way I imagine there will be a voice command option to where you can say like hey come on car let's go to work and it'll take you to work but if you need to override the system\nOr you want to go manual they're trying to couple of models one has a controller that's more like a video game controller then staring well it's not a wheel at all just has some buttons on it the other one has an app on your phone let you put an app on your phone you can control it\nLike that you can ... you would steer the car with an app on your phone [noise]\nYeah I I just don't see how that\nWould work the average person's used to doing something like that oh I've never done this for how to make it go this way or [noise] you know a gaming control do you realize it's been quite a few years since I\nHeld the gaming control device\nHad been that long for me\nWell and and you're going to get the whole little lot because you have little kids but I think the last time with the boys I was playing uh what's that military\nGame call of duty hall of duty awesome\nAnd one of them just kept like killing me real quick and it just you know after a while that got really tiring so I said you know what I'm think I'm done training you guys\nYeah dying every ... seconds isn't a fun game I Can't play that one of my cousins either because I could put out on the same thing and I'm not playing 'cause you know this map and I don't\nI'm just training material that is that higher end of it so now if\nThe car what might be is it might not be more like a steering wheel but might be like two handles for you to turn kind of like and it might be recessed into the dash and when it's needed it could pop out unfold think about it like that\nAnd that would have been on demolition man they had that I Do remember that movie\nI Can't believe it didn't win the Oscar for best picture Wesley Snipes Sylvester Stallone it was brilliant\nBut I just think of it being something like that 'cause it's rarely get to be used but if it does it will puff out\nSee they didn't call it an autonomous feeling demolition\nMan they called it auto pilot and so when she got on the road the steering will collapse and went back into the steering column C I I Would think of it more like that and I do not recall seeing that in that movie I may not have seen that movie completely either [noise]\nAll right we have some time here can I get you to respond to another call from the Saturday show this is just the two and a half\nMinute clip okay All right we're going to try Mary from pop or bill\nI Want to know I had no mortgage I have no bills I have a farm [noise] um I have just a little bit of savings the stocks that are doing really really well but they're only in one specific category which is there a way that you\nOf had to say this how many different different conquer stocks that would like a balanced played out so to speak\nYeah if you want to cover different sectors you know it's just like the fighting stocks and all these tech stock like Facebook Netflix a apple Amazon Google yeah those ... if you're holding those you're\nYou're susceptible to bad news and it seems to affect all of those I don't mind holding those and some of those were quite expensive but it's also the same thing like oh I've got me like ten oil stocks well I don't want everything to be an oil so when we're going through\nSelection and a portfolio we do look at the industries or the sectors that they're in and sometimes we'll have buys\nThat will show up on five or six companies that are in a sector\nAnd then we might just add two of them even though there are all great buys I Do want diversity within the portfolio I Would look at that way on my own personal holdings as well as I won't diversity I diversification I don't want to be overloaded in one sector\nAnd that's part of if you're doing the buying and now you you should you probably don't have the resources\nThat we have but you know our systems were checking some six thousand securities every day we're looking at the fundamentals of them are and then we're shifting to technical once they passed fundamental task short term long term simply put has to have momentum\nAnd they have to cycle into what I'll call the by spot\nThat I won't and they're so all that plays in and it just sometimes you have\nA sector where all of a sudden they're six seven eight buys why because the whole sector has moved down and they've all moved the same way and they're probably going to all move back up but I don't want to buy a home technically I only need warn that does that help Mary\nReally really thank you very much\nWell thank you for calling All right we're back live now so she was looked at the word she was looking for was diversify did she have a voice that reminded you of somebody you know and your family\nYeah yeah yeah and ...\n... which is also my thought for originally when she called in to the show but you know you won't diversification you don't want to hold too many in one sector and and that's like tech sector I don't want to hold too many of those uh oil sector I don't want to have\nToo many oil companies can have a few depending on your overall holding how many are you holding in your portfolio or over why you did you know a true diversification probably shouldn't hold no more than three percent of the festival assets and in any one company so that\nKind of [laughter] and if your whole thing a little bit of cash\nYou know this kitten you around thirty to thirty three depending on what point is fully invested for you always think you should always hold on we'll cash so that's you know neighborhood of thirty\nCompanies there then it depends on their growth and when the pill off some profit you know are they ... but when you're holding thirty positions you know if you're holding three in each sector then you're you're looking at one tenth sectors\nOut there and and and that some white to think about that is you know how many banking stocks to you all too many tech stock how many oil the downside of that is that sounds like it's really hard to keep up with how many car companies do you want to hope\nI got to keep up with ten different companies or whatever thirty companies however many would it be yeah three companies across in sectors flood of Homer Gregory\nWell if you're managing the portfolio ... where do you do in every day you're managing that right now your manager my portfolio well you have somebody that's doing it all day\nEvery day that looks and all these things consider these things consider that exposure looks at the fundamentals the technical word\nThis is headed [noise] hey if you're looking for some daytime help you can call me up my office look if you're married over six the do you have a plan if something happens to one of you called my office ... for eight\nThree two Ninety two hundred Gregory

information about Trump and his team information most of it that turned out later on to be completely false\nIt was the effort to get that information into the bloodstream of the department of justice and the FBI through ivy\nWhile bypassing them out they weren't going to feed it to him because then it would have to go to the GI track and if it was poisoned the stomach as ways of dealing with that they wanted this main line right into the bloodstream\n\nThey needed to bypass all of those body protections that the deal Jay and the FBI half\nThe vetting of information the woods procedure where they had information through multiple channels the vetting of sources the ah you know credibility checks I listen you're telling us to stop but this is a political opponent of yours like this is political off all research right they want it to bypass all of that the information superhighway was a way to do this\nThe way to do was to go right to the top of the FBI and not to the field office guys the guys actually doing the hard work investigating the kidnappings across state lines that bank robberies the terrorism cases they didn't bring their information to them they brought their information to the\nTop level guys the suits who they knew where politicians before they were cops\nAnd they bypass all of those legal protections they did it into the FBI through what noon yes revealed this weekend by shuttling this up to a lawyer right into the top levels of the FBI\n\nHow did they do it in the the OJ the information superhighway it was obvious that the OJ they mainline their\nRight to Bruce or who was the number four official into the OJ who was actually meeting with Christopher Steele who was paid to do this what what's known as revealed this week Ken was a pivotal key piece of information\nAbout what makes this even more devastating and more profound 'cause I get it I totally understand where the lives are going to go with this\nFor water a guy had information or people pass informational ... no no no that's not the way that works\nThey'll typically pass it to a field office that\nWill investigate the vet the information they'll go into a court of law there'll be a grand jury at some point there will be some adversarial hearing either at some initial appearance later on or a trial\nThat's not what they did they walked into a fight as a court where there was no ability for the Trump deep to defend themselves at all they brought information that was paid for by the Democrats and and and the real kicker here\n\nThe bureau lied about is\nJim Comey and others insisted that they didn't know where a lot of this information was coming from they didn't\nUnderstand the political origins of ladies and gentleman that is clearly a lie a fabrication at this point that is clearly made up they were meeting with the lawyer who is being paid by the DNC\nIt was a fabrication it was made up it was nonsense why with the bureau lie about it these upper level managers if they had nothing to hide this is I I mean this answer this question answers itself\n\nThe information superhighway it was an effort to bypass all of these protections folks\nThis cases discuss than it is a grotesque abusive power when all the information comes out you're going to look at this you're going to read this I have this stuff in my book and you're going to sit there and say to yourself how the heck did this happen in the United states of America\nThe key now is to not let it happen again\nAnd I got more and this and the other side of the break a seven seven three
