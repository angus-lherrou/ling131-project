of any kind on production\nPeople do that they'll say dumb things though you know somebody they don't like or have ... they'll like tax them and tell them ... ... email or put it out there where they'll see it but they would never stand twelve inches from their\nFace and say some of those things 'cause people for some reason disconnect\nThe real world and the online world and if you will guidance on\nHow to apply will win should I text a ... one show in a tweet it will pretend you're standing in front of them live in the real world instead of the online world which isn't the real world the\nYou know it's it's all digital and shows up on a screen somewhere but you're having the same effect and asked me if the law must get set it to them in person and went to a newspaper and said yeah I'll take the company private for four hundred and twenty dollars a share the deals ready to go public shit\nYou're getting in the same trouble but he didn't go do that to a newspaper or one of the journalists that you are always column in for quotes or whatever no he just tweeted it\nHere's a\nPicture yourself in the real world would you do that or would you make those comments twelve

they ... the example is you know it's just as bad as if you set it in person I think\nI think in some of these instances it's worse to say it on Twitter because like if Roseanne Barr had made that

the state [noise] I spoke with the person yesterday and he just to prove that pre landfall disaster requesting they'd yesterday his allows us to bring more federal resources towards the end he's also declared a state of emergency and thirty five forty pounds Florida\nI was talking to Richard cement and also Richard Valdez earlier that great producers in the ... show to talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a\nWith a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of substantive and procedural due process must apply the\nSecond big winner is my president Donald John Trump not just one more victory and his first what a twenty two months\nIn office the trumps church scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle is won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the God does he does in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassed mustn't that came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think of a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit\nIt's back Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my model that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined now there will be middle aged judge from Yale headed in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because\nBut Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and the eloquence all of his ah all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight us people like Chris Wallace\nOf Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now cabin all he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAh he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth well as she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the\nTherapist notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nLast name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment to the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise so tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until Monday he'll be

you're just guys look strictly ... and you go off the values of the country that you don't kill the absolute mind boggling oh you're kidding of course you know this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread come isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of war or Christina for down to ... path when she oddly question her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests and all I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend or Christina Ford and bother why Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\nBut what what the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit a boyfriend and Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford a lot about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that's the only conclusion one could feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting out actually\nThat's that's terrified because you're now hey take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the fear factor and it can be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell when John Waters cabin all go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps of some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know when it happened I didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight\n[laughter] that would that would be it wouldn't come back you\nKnow but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such a thing\nYou know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no is this ever live so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongfully convicted of sexual assault or Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry uh two black guys spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a hub State University case were for college man into hubs or were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nAnd it came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accuses someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look her in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story or seen afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nAnd so when this has happened is that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating allies against Brett Kavanaugh the answer is not just know the answers hell no they're going to continue\nOut how much you could save and why men to share is so popular go to ... dot com or called eight\nSix six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible met a share dot com or eight six six eighty eight Bible\nLiberal elites widowed do some common sense from Muslims and\n\n\n\nOthers saying can I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal\nI hear about the norms and the presidency let's talk about norms a presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was\nThat normal how 'bout the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky than he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncrease taxes increase Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThe Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is that the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media\nThe idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water grade in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the presidency so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley Raul arc that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities your wife ... any direction they encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to regret otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz listening liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal did they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate\nDid violate the norms of the Senate did a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump several it to\nDepends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer Hillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... remember the eight twenty sixteen but he may not get it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party except that the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAren't heaven they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as the same sex\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or what whether it's all the other investigations because we've all foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as she could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amoral abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese New dollars more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nUp all this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also to test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAnything 'cause everybody as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries\nHe tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it right I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAnd that too is sick today Sharon we going to run thank you for your call from Pennsylvania is a

Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what she told the therapist\nIncentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in our mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens have became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine Ford\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist who rented a room in our house\nThat caused her to put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapists six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then some out in her mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys she said it was one instead of late teens that I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime dying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward and won the Senate said\nWhen the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers were so perfect for um\nHer responses drew out I'm feeling some sympathy say we're absolutely perfect I'm Jamaican on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue\nBut this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys or tried to write a paper and that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident didn't damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and the doctor it\nDidn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five

New York then we're done because Texas and Florida will tip this thing permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't\nSure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nI look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done\nAnd you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz lives whoever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump as a rock star and there's an animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa denied he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy's ... a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz would have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and\nIf you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald you know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have offered fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis country get back to where it needs to be\nImaginative Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court\nWould you have Gorsuch would you have Kevin ... you'd have to Ginsburg look alikes and imagine the status of the country then an RPG the notorious RPG at some point going to mean or maker I'm not sure I Want to\nAmy Coney Barrett from Notre Dame to take over Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's continue with more ... than out till Monday it'd be back with you on Monday some good a good\nDays all from our living in the number to call again as eight seven seven three one two three one one seven seven three one three a one one still counting in the great American in for the great when mark\n\nUp and we're here for thirty eight years and there's a lot about the company I worked for and the great friends or work with like Katie and say I agree\nWalter I've been here for a total of eight years working with you and everybody here on harnessing possum experience and I love being able to help people like mammography and grace furniture gallery\nAltering Katie I've ever known I or for several years and every one we deal with it I made it was it's obvious that I hardly breathe waged war send your emails Biloxi jobs I hard media dotcom\nOvernight what's new today on the free I her radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the scary movie [laughter] our spicy platelets has joke tracks with labor is why when no after de\nBlanc mixture you break out all our great valium party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium the new I our Radio Free ... collections\nTalk on\nEach piece unveiling a new product the H.

section pulling out white people beating on their car and using using racial epithets against them and you can have this\nHard to prove this a hate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that [noise] I\nAgree that's where should come from the top\nBecause you know in Charlottesville went out one white skinhead ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was charged with murder in\nVirginia then he was charged with a hate crime now I don't know I'd say crime if a white person kills a white person but nonetheless I Want that got to spend the rest of his life in jail because he killed and then as a woman who was protesting I'm with them\nAnd when and when when white supremacist march or on Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice law would choose most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAre running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff that happens but ten times that stuff\nHappens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality from what it is which has hate from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNow know they're not\nWell shame we've got to go thanks for your call this move on to John and California John in California Welcome to the ... show John please go ahead\nI Want to ask you a great legal mind a question from the school to get out to vote over they're controlling the streets in Oregon\nAnd the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting I'm totally against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities actor under act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals\nAnd this happened in Washington DC\nThis was under color or a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted as such a way so as to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking over as intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking wide citizens\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this\nIs despicable this was wrong it can happen in America\nIs political gender to go forward or you didn't even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring up the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected him to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in ... to take over city streets block intersections lie\nIn front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job and the mayor of Portland a clown affects was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in this situation the incivility on the left his unspeakable\nAfter state says a leftist movement saying thank you for your a great job covering it for the great one John\nThank you and when I watch what happened on the Supreme Court on Thursday Friday Saturday and even today on Brett Kavanaugh's first day on the job large numbers of individuals in violation of federal law committed criminal trespass on federal property\nAnd I'll watch them climbing on top of an statues and scratching up the doors of the United States Supreme court how\nHow do they do this in public committed ... literally thousands of crimes in public a few are arrested there find like fifty dollars on the first

Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look I didn't like where they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and uh working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's

process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not checking one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade\nHas been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese and it's going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea and now according harassed most thing that came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think of a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were PIN cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit\nHe hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man and he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful\nGuy's got no backup and them and only has stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning and Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit us court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of look ... looked over Trump and said that's my motto\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other whip the middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his ah all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News\nWho said after the testimony of that liar and she was a lawyer Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later but Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that\nIt's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and you and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of our witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to write for\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the mid Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and changed what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in\nTwenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend or many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti traveled do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is the disease swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham\nMitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president\nDonald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh

coach somebody on a lie detector tests so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that's the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that actually allow\nThat terrified because now I think somebody to watch a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the mere fact that it can be absolutely it's something like\nThat you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell what John Waters threats Kevin all go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape and there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and\nThe foreign witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be\nWitnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw ... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight on [laughter] that would that would

when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho were wrongfully convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry uh two black guys spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a host or university case were for college she meant at home server chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nThey came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused is somewhat of a sexual assault\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that the weak took ... know Jeff
