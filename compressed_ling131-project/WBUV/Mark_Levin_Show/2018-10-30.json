I don't even like you're looking at the straight number but we're going to plug those numbers and if there's another pension when does\nIt turn out so that gives us some basis of numbers and therefore short\nFrom those income that are coming in then we're going to plug in water we taking from the assets what do I mean assets you know the savings you have the non qualified\nMoney you've put away for retirement that are I have four one K. the Ross accounts those tools that you have do you have any other income sources we haven't\nTalked about so wherever we're short\nWe're going to look at polling income or distributions from those assets and we might look at are we starting with our race or are we blending it do you have a good mixture of pre tax money\nTax free money and after tax money will look at how to blend that\nOr if you're really loaded up with all pre tax money means everything to tax as ordinary income so that gives us a different tax look as well\nThen what about required minimum distributions I'm looking at one\nHere where the individuals are uh early sixties so it means in looking Fifteen Years out of Fred here he said sixty two which means uh near Fifteen he's going to be Seventy six so we're having the fact OK water the required\nMen on the distributions watched that\nWell that's a number when you turn suddenly and a half there is a minimum a male the government\nOur rafts treasury are expecting you to take out of that account which means that's a taxable event that could also\nEven when you're not meeting it so we have cases where that helps that people's needing it some time it gets too big so we go to like water ... what can we do to reduce that back in maybe take more on the front end\nOr I really don't need it but you've got to take it what and yet bounces your tax bracket pets why were you see all these things we need to talk about\nThis it and come in shove the statement across a desk what can you do for me well we're going to do math radical planning we're going to talk about all these\nThings are going to talk about reasonable expectation returned we're going to look at all the income sources and see how that's affecting the assets sometimes\nConversation leads to is you don't have enough assets to retire in January and generate that income without a spend now if you're going to spend down are you still going to have money at a hundred and ten that's what we would hope for some cases gosh I'm going to have more\nOn a three percent return a hundred and ten see we could use really conserve a number and assets can take off what I've got lots of questions and you don't even probably know all the questions asked I'm going to help you with that so you can look at all these different things and have truly\nAn understanding of where you're going to be then we'd get in to watch your risk number\nHow do we level while volatility these are all things that you need to know from an income\nPlanning standpoint and our three I'm going to touch on how we pulled this together in a particular case for Fred and talked about that 'cause we're that spreadsheet print out what do you call it what's that system called\nThe guided planning cyst hadn't said that all segment just want to get at it but yeah okay yeah the guided planning system I love doing that stuff income planning\nAnd just putting everything together and that's not a software package that Gregory went and bought a best buy is proprietary system that you develop we've developed over the past dozen years\nPrograms but she's pretty good\nI I had health [noise] [noise]\nHi this is going to do it for today's show memory home away from the show when you get life dot com and the winning it life apples back to do some ... at seven in the meantime the check out all of our cats on the winning a life that I'm James Parker we are when you get life of Gregory ...

an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with um what did you see there's\nOil which you know a horrific act towards that as a medic attack and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and the talk to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I are what part of it last night [noise]\nUh that really brought up the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the humidity is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stuff on a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday at there was just a moment of silence for the entire government of Israel ...\nWe are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel or a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach stickers about that yeah we are the ones with the speech that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were in Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report or the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nKind of it is as you say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began in fails and sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nThat it once again become fashionable or to attack cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after he was now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris\nAttacks against Jews and lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen and the Jewish community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you can have a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's a stream\nMissing I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media is you have this rise of abuse online hate groups\nI think it's extremely dangerous dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your log in constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this\nSo they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these\nThese used to be reputable organizations really focused

this country is in the show me state Missouri [noise]\nAnd uh he's got an excellent Republican candidate Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I oppose cabin up because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she she look\nDesperate to be honest with you mark and as you should be because ... she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turned around a vote no on Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court justice\nKevin ... no ... no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just she could not be out of step\nWith his she running a New Yorker Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that should be a great senator one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the polls or she is just out of touch with\nPeople of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you or votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her of of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she is accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up with Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat\nAnd you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in one of your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power the radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept\nThe results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said\nThat is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and that people want somebody's going to go be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose a ... a ... methods of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on it many times and our debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare\nTo do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell see if she tries to duck as he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's where this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against your party I mean she never does on edge any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagined what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are\nOr who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nThat you make a good point Medicare for all is Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turn us into one ... right\nExactly

were all forced to talk with that voice now eight seven seven three one two three eight one one what's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's a\nWhile it's you know a horrific act towards that but it's a medic attack in us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with a member of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought up the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start and uh and what I wanted to do was Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why we support for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor of Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones that I speak [laughter] that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nKind of it is going to say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began to two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mention\nA thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population market their accounting for over a half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh attacked the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than wasn't two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I\nReally think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack Jews\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack twos and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen and the Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you can have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's extreme\nMissing I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media is you have this rise of abuse online hate groups\nI think it's extremely dangerous dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here and I know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "30"}
