like in real life hey so did you see the same article I did 'cause I saw you referenced the number of how much would it take to start a McDonald's franchise yeah yeah so the average total start up investment is between is about one to two million bucks depending on where you're at\nBut what caught my attention was the um revenue from it\nA hundred and fifty thousand that profit that's not even revenue that yeah well that's what I mean profit but you know revenue yeah quite a bit of revenue but whatever the average one makes about a hundred and fifty thousand and profit lotta burgers yeah that's a lot of burgers that's a lot of money to put out\nThere in\n... million nuts Fifteen Percent profit two million seven and a half\nWhich still pretty good but I don't know if I Want to put two million out there for\nSeven and a half ago uh [noise] so if you want to make a million a year you need ten McDonalds\nOh man I mean you may when I met hard it is\nIt is you've got to go through acquiring a bunch of stores to make some money well here's the air in another interesting\nThing the actual franchise fee that you know just a ... the building is its own set of expense all the equipment or whatever but if you want to say I have to worry McDonald's on your\nFranchise forty five thousand dollars just for the rights to use the name by comparison to become a chick fillet franchisee that franchise fee is ten thousand dollars\nSo\nOkay better a little less selective huh\nWell\nYou're not going to buy one if you want to be open on Sundays that's true too yeah and you know ... let's see how many things they do let's see uh just one thing chicken\nThey do good and they have something I Wish everyone else had diet lemonade is I Love lemonade and\nI don't like what you have to have diet yeah I Know the franchise that does chicken only gangs yeah Louisiana based yeah yeah they have lemonade I don't know about the diet but they have some good lemonade over there too\nI I'm just I'm not on a diet it's just I just want to keep my wife interested that's all okay here's another a wicked statistic unless you wanted to jump in I don't know if I interrupt you a second ago but the this one doesn't make you very happy Gregory the top three percent of taxpayers in the United states\nPay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen which means the top three percent pay more than Seventy million Americans\nWhen it comes to taxes [noise] a lot of people like\nTo focus on the income inequality well there's also a tax inequality too\nAnd when when you see that the spread right there as looks like it's pretty much in line right seems pretty fair to me if they're going to be\nMaking all this money they got to pay a lot of the taxes so I won't grab by the taxes if they don't gripe about the time is that a deal Gregory\nYeah this is Mike are you you're good there yeah\nThis was interesting a story every red actually a week ago about the a mattress from filing for bankruptcy so we\nBut another big firms spin around for like two decades file for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection the mouth would be closing as many as seven hundred stores in the U.S and I believe they closed a couple of stores\nOr around the metro New Orleans or Abbott looked along the Gulf Coast and such\nBut mattress from is the U.S largest specially mattress retailer with an estimated three thousand two hundred and Seventy two stores across us according to wed Bush\nAnalysts F ... store counters grown significantly in the past years as it is expanded quickly an acquired competing change such a sleep piece which purchase and twenty six team what the heck is sleep is it's a mattress place you know kinda makes you sleepy [laughter]\nAnd accommodate sleeping I got the chain um they had too many stores and us given the mattress says are\nA product that is typically about every seven to ten years\nYou don't grow up there by ah you know we've had this thing for a year to go spend another grand get a new one\nOr just throw some pads on it it'll be fine according to a start up think I'm\nForty two point six percent of mattress firms stores are located within a mile radius of each other well that's kind of a problem what yeah\nThey just oh there's one Merrill is all move stores into their idea that the proximity of mattress for firms store locations is related to mommy law during or any illegal activity is absolutely false Murphy told Business Insider\nWhy didn't bring it up for it [laughter] what are you worried about it is yes\nI Do yeah that was thrown out there so there are some law suits and stuff on that but at the end of twenty Seventeen its parent company Stein hall holdings which is currently being investigated on charges of fraud said it would be closing two hundred mattress firms at the time and analysts expect that many more\nWould follow suit in that oh I see what's going on but when you start going in and\nLooking at the numbers which I don't have here in front of me but when you start looking at the numbers and the amount of\nMoney owed to these mattress companies it's scary it's it's ... Dick you'll is that that they have piled up and a Stein off has financial\nManagement problems there's a lot of money mismanagement in the company that led to these difficulties there what ultra\nLow rates have basically encouraged all these entities to go out and go get some of that cheap money while they can and then a rising right world is going to make an untenable I see what you're saying they'll use that they have over three thousand stores one thousand of them though are right around lake Ozark it's the weirdest thing is [laughter]\nAnd that's a money laundering joke from Netflix for those few and by the way I'm almost caught up to you we're we're gonna have to have a chat about that soon but I'm two episodes behind\nSo hey we got another event coming up in November fourteenth so it is exactly one week away ...

[noise]\nFrom the men do Buick GMT studios he's used talk going on for nine point and I urge radios [noise]\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put it in acid or something this is terrible it's\nAwful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some of the wailing but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with uh with um Mohammed bin ... so called M B. S. than MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor kick him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show the murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and it's a ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the\nAnswer of course is no this is the ah\nEvent there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months of the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump\nHow can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and some out last this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nOf taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we helped get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happened happened it\nOccurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you\nKnow what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move\nOn absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by legal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage\nMS Thirteen with are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and as Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what this was going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the

desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you uh keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we're going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get the Supreme Court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flip through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point of Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they went out confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations that the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare\nAnd the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another\nAspect to courses foreign policy right now despite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's\nOn the ballot the economy according to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years now\nBe about judges not to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as his testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them all for paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los

go ahead\n[laughter] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S as complicit\nWith the job market show um murder I Would say two hundred percent yes and reason why I'm saying that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if it's the deep state\nBut the league that they had conversations with authority print and his entourage arranged a kitten that this guy though and if you look and recently um John Brennan the last past two days and then and they say he confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point and\nOh don't do on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera how

I guess it wrote some comes the Washington Post he had a green card but it is a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess on Saudi\nArabian territory and yet and yet what ah it's it's what I mean oh interesting\n... when a when re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car police officers in New York City\nThat was like a one day story nationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing M. A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nIn the store for a week and I think you brought up a good point\nWho do you think the left is wanting the fat and quick or a journalist or one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are mad about that don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own and it works at the Washington Post rather than uh some of our of our\nUm police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean why why do we spent\nI mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it\nI imagine it right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC holidays is about ... ... what to Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better was a ... or was it\n... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter who advocate at the murder of police officers and one B. L. M. got what they want it what are we went dead cops when you want them now and re most in lieu were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered in a barge down Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point what is in the media spend time instead of the show geek in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform and spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered\nRe most uh Lewis killed according to the black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and kill police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not to Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events\nWas a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson and grabbed his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven\nBut the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ... New York city and murder them why didn't CNN covered that aspect to this story and the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly met with representatives\nBlack lives matter that advocate at the murder of cops who were killed in Dallas in Baton Rouge why didn't CNN cover it that way\n[noise] [noise] because it doesn't fit their narrative 'em and they think about that it doesn't ...\nIt doesn't in other words they can't use that as a weapon against ah either John Banner or George Bush Ronald Reagan or now it's now it's Donald Trump see the media ought to call balls and strikes\nBut instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda and then they go after the obscure fact\nOf some saw being killed in Turkey which they can use as a club against Jared Kushner because Assad's have invested in real estate ventures of Trump years ago and they spend money at the hotel next to the White House so they keep looking for

really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now just men to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers well we can't sell\nInto their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said\nListen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly

this on Monday and Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry how 'bout that headline how about the a P supposedly objective independent the AP quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage how about CNN you'll love this one this is as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests was strong evidence of Native American ancestry BBC\nElizabeth Warren DNA tests fine strong evidence of Native American blood\nThat strong evidence amounts to something less than point one percent in reality she is less Native American blood than the typical so called white American has Native American blood it's unbelievable and are about\nThe Daily Beast on Monday quote breaking news Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test yes she is Native American\nHow 'bout that Boston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News the nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as a minority to make money\nAnd so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the progressive tribe if you're part of the group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter will not ban you\nIf you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admit in the presidency using drugs committing felonies it's no big story at all but if you're outside the group and your name is Brett Kavanaugh and when you were Fifteen Years old you drank beer\nOr had some posting in your your book my God that's a big story\nSo Clinton in office as president drugs\nNo problem Brett Kavanaugh drank beer you're ... when he was Fifteen major major problems and so I look at the puck receipt of

and you it came across over the phone that he respects you quite a bit it was a great interview in regard to this or\nA Saturday a journalist from the coast I hear constantly on the media is portrayed as a journalist\nOr from Washington Post inferring that he's an American American citizen and this is just trying to prove that Trump doesn't care about journalists and uh he he kisses up to the Saudis it's these are people that have been helping us fight terrorists\nFor years under Obama he had written lines\nAnd ISIS was a a JV team took a Trump a one year to get rid of ISIS you don't hear about that in the news anymore\nBecause you know I don't know because it doesn't fit how long did Obama deal with ISIS eight years now and Trump got rid of them and when you are how big of a story was that\nA just a blip on the radar for one day\nThey'll let me ask you this was ambassador Christopher Stevens and American\nUh invent guys who had a credit you know all the time you know\nProtecting

with a grain when Martin living back to your calls that I have a lot of tech and then I some of the most literate audiences in radio is\nThe ... show because of the strength of his affiliates and the and the reach of these is intellect and we have caused all over the country including San Francisco and Chris in San Francisco welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead\nOn high or you are incredibly articulate and it's a joy to listen to you you get the F\n... and very ... thank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they yeah they're dominating the news surface all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a budget competing\nConservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say\nWell I don't have the concert at station where I live\nWell we'll see are you going to go on how about the art TV you check to see our TV you can check some news\nDot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think see our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith in the afternoon if I Wanna watch that crap all watch MSNBC so I Can't watch Shepard Smith there's parts of Fox that I Can't watch\nI Love Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing but but I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what it's doing and it concerns me but I I like more information not less than ... when I I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check out a Drudge Report news match dot com I check mark ... website I go to the Daily Caller I go to daily wire\nI checked out Fox and I go to those six or red state dot com is pretty good I certainly do seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI ... except when I leave for into is that mainstream media where people don't have the ... and ... they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the facts they don't want for conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said from top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're gonna have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing say at CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars\nBecause you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows and his TV 'cause they're picking to the choir we need to change minds like kind of starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go there\nYes and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut but he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took Leslie stall apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing\nIn his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence you know it's like it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the television shows like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah it's it's unbelievable\nAnd I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four pretty good\nBut there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida he'd go anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nYeah I Wonder if it passed and he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a ... to ... you know and this is off the subject that I said well irony and the dentist because they're starting to accusing him of going after young prosecutes theirs is competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nBut uh I'll tell you what's unfair criticism when you picture our first lady as a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office and the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around ... to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama\nWas pictured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office what would the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWell where's the outcry there is none me because the Trump is Mrs Trump ... that no outrage is sufficient to cause criticism\nAs long as the Trump Bullock we gotta go Chris thanks for your call I Want to thank once

Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo is back from his but she'll be Saudi Arabia and the turkey trying to learn what happened to journalist Joel ... you will brief President Trump in the morning on what he learned but on the flight back to Washington the secretary admitting it the diplomatic tightrope\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put it in acid or something this is terrible\nIt's awful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some of the wailing but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called M B. S. than NBS is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic\nWe believe and due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nBy the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKick him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of\nCourse is no this is the ah the event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months of the\nTrump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs his own speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country\nAnd that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that bonding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's\nOur enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gig and stupidly they decide to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things were heading toward the Republican way in\nMany states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp than a lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about your mouth can show gay\nWho was killed in Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith the girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction if we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea\nSo let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three one one

before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court\nAnd so if in twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not come from any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will and if the Senate stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate a you could nominate but then when I come from one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations have every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where\nRepublicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by
