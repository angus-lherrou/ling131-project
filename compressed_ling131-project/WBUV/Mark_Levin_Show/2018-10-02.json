{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Probably the call of the week from the Saturday show if you want to hear the whole thing it's already available for you waiting on you right now on the winning it life app\nJohnny from Noah hello more or less for you around the rest of the country are you doing hey doing comedy yeah\nGuys look I Know you generally don't do politics but um you said something in the previous hour that you know right now I get your way climate\nLet me ask the question is area oh maybe I call it I asked the Democrats retake ... a sense of the economic agenda could act\nYou know like how much that could actually start and\nOur first of all this is a financial question more than political mind taking that yeah I I basically get this question asked every day in meetings that I have now are you already have probably use every day isn't it yeah 'cause it's it's a concern like ... you know what if if\nIf the house flips or Congress flips\nYou know what I was just one of those things it's asked about his taxes what what what do we have that we have eight years left on this tax plan basically we're the tax rates are discounted it's not permanent but it is for eight years\nIs how it's built now of course things can change you could have Congress change inside of that\nBut what what what would it take for those tax reduction to change early it take Congress the house and the Senate and the president will sign off on it so if Congress flip flops hypothetically and the president is still in there that's not the three parts that it needs\nCan Congress override yeah that's going to be very difficult so for his stuff to be reversed while he's still president\nI'd say is difficult some of the things and the confidence that going forward they could block him on a number of thanks his agenda won't get fulfilled but kind of where we're at I think we're in good shape just some of the stuff we're looking to get done may not\nGet done and that's why you know we've got a two year window for to get things done it could extend to eight years and this goes about I understand what people said publicly and all but people will vote by their wallet\nAre things getting better people want to change and they voted for change do you want to politicians out so they brought a business guy yeah we'll see what the mood of the country is do they like having jobs growing pay autonomy growing\nAnd feeling good about things business and most of the people voting or not business owners their workers are they feeling good about the jobs and making more money and I think that's what this comes down to Johnny are doing what happens in the mortgage world if the house or Senate flips\nWell I think it's just going to depend I mean I I I think it's there's going to be in my opinion I don't see we we've seen because look\nWanted them to not raise rates and they did it\nRight so I I don't think from a interest rates standpoint you're going to see much adjusting calling their unless everything just falls absolutely apart in GDP the first sign that they show that GDP went\nYou know from four to blow it I don't even think it's going to necessarily be the the Senate and house and all this I think all the big change is going to be twenty twenty if there's a presidential changes where you're going to see a much more larger effect I mean ...\nPersonally yeah I could see it affecting the market 'cause look yes say just to house flips that does create some ... some uncertainty and the markets like\nThey like to kind of have an expectation of how things are going to go and that's what the the market show they said this is going to be better with the business guy in as president of the house lips you could see the market maybe adjust\nTo that if it's worse low but more of adjustment and then kind of see OK house we're going to pull back and kind of look and see how things are going and then if we change presidents\nThat's a whole nother situation too far down the road to worry about now but I think we're going to be in good shape because I think once again people are going to vote by their wallets\nYeah I think we just have a stalemate if if one of those flips which means his continued agendas going to stop but it's not going to be reverse 'cause most of that was done by executive see a reduction in the federal register is going to change is not going to change much it's going to stay out where it is and I think that's more impactful than the tax\nCode and that was why there were so he got so much done in his first two years than anybody else that we can think about in history why the prospect of losing the house\nOr one of them or whatever that coverage Johnny any follow ups you get yeah yeah it\nDoes very well state a gentleman I was just saying 'cause if his agenda was stymied or reversed and the economy turned down a plane you know and\nI'm sure they'll take blame recall you know this is going to rural next couple of years\nAnd then there is your call of the week with an assist from the great going sign a mortgage gumbo so we have a quite a few conversations on this show about technology and\nDriverless cars and grocery delivery in drone stuff and this is why we talk about it because eventually this new technology is going to overlap indefinitely affect your money we go to Greece for this one where the finance ministry tax inspectors have started using drones to keep\nAn eye on some holiday hotspot [noise] like what are you talking about well look\nGreece is one of these countries where they don't really have a whole lot going on besides tours and tourism is about twenty percent of their GDP in Greece and what's happening is now they're flying up drones over there trying to do this project and ...\nAnd it's an island is popular with tourists and what happens is these boat operators go on day trips where you either go scuba diving or you go deep water fishing or you go on a tour you know just go on the ships and come back they use these drones to go up and to see how many ships went out\nAnd how many people are on the ships they catalogue the information when the when the the drone gets all their stuff and comes back and then they check that information against the receipts they cross reference it with declared receipts and onsite inspections\nTurns out and they're just trying this in one port this project is just being tried in St journey right now nine tourists vessels were checked\nAnd after one month they were led should not have issued a number of receipts totaling about thirty thousand dollars in their owners now need to cough up the tax money they owe on that thirty thousand undeclared and they have fines on top of it\nOh he smokes drone thing just got a little less cute isn't it yeah they're going to be using it to watching you\nAll right well I guess we're just going to have to\nNot cheat on our taxes I mean that didn't seem too hard to do but they're busing people left and right\nAlso something I Want to point out this kind of affects your money but it's not all the way there yet why people we're dealing with the the circus and the Senate over the confirmation hearings all last week a couple of big bills actually are making their way through the opioid bill\nKind of a mess I'm not a big fan of it but it passed and it's going to have some some changes that could affect you but really the tax reform to point out though\nIt passed the house it's probably not going to pass the Senate and its current form if it passes at all but you think that would at least get some sort of mentioned I mean the house just got together last week and said hey remember these\nTax cuts on individuals that were supposed to expire and twenty twenty five well let's take a permanent we are going to the ... yeah they voted to make it permanent [noise]\nAfter all the complaining about how corporations or get a get a tax cut this permanent but individuals get a tax cut that their taxes are going to go up not one drop of reporting did I hear on that in the news\nThey were so all digging through their belly button about the Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh and look I'm not pointing fingers anybody Fox News and Fox Business or just about as guilty\nI did see it on Fox Business I did see it on CNBC but I didn't see it on Fox News MSNBC CBS or any of the network news is we got it for you though I filter through all that\nTo get you a little bit of information that you need to know that can affect your wallet hey these universal savings accounts past\nYeah so we'll we'll find out more about that when it hits the Senate floor and I'll keep you updated accordingly in the meantime you're home away from the show winning a life dot com and the winning it life at go down to that thing put it on your phone you're going to need it soon I'm James Parker we are winning

your brain that\nHave a real analysis of this stuff rather than ...\nIt tastes in rather than repetition you understand the media are exploiting you're right\nThey keep using breaking news headline news breaking news that there is nothing breaking and there's nothing headline\nNothing else has happened\nSo we're not doing this show and what I have done on the Fox show and what I Do live in t._v. and I really enjoy living TV I Hope you do to what I Do is something a little different I treat you with respect I treat you like you have intelligence not this constant dumbing down with big mouth\nThis Rachel Michel ... per ... per\nI think a lot of people were jealous of her these judges these guys who were judges they were the lowest judges in one state or another try all of a sudden their constitutional experts they're experts on all things they're experts on nothing nothing\n\nShe broke down in the case if you paid attention she made mistakes made out a doctor for\n\nThat's why they keep talking in generalities about all women all sex crimes oh mental suppression and repression\nIt I don't want to talk about all I Want to talk about this right here in front of us\n\nDr Ford comes forward on July six whites thirty\nSix years six years\nComes forward on July sixth that's not suspicious to anybody that's been a judge for twelve years\nGuy was on the Ken Starr prosecution team for four years I was that the Bush White House never said a word not ... not a word to anybody\n\nBen he's nominated to the United States Supreme court all of a sudden here's my civic duty wait a minute there were parties in front of the DC circuit court for twelve years so we're rolling over three hundred that he wrote he ... he was involved in over a thousand of them and all of a sudden her civic duty on July six\nWhat happened to her civic duty on July ...\n\nYes I'm allowed to ask these questions\n\nI'm a what do you think mark nothing happened you know I Believe something did happen but I think she's wrong about who the perpetrator was and I think at this point you probably knows it which is why she doesn't know who drove her home she there's so many gaps\nYou understand if you don't have witnesses are corroborating evidence you can't even get into a courtroom you understand that right\n\nSo now notice how it's changed over the weekend at Brett Kavanaugh a lot about his drinking what am I lied about his drinking a lot about a drinking a lot about a drinking Mr President shouldn't\nThey're worried about drinking on Capitol Hill is a bunch of slush a slush isn't drunks and all kinds of things on Capitol\nHill but isn't that an interesting stand it\nIf he lied about his drinking when he was in high school or college\nThat's it\nThese politicians on Capitol Hill they lie all the time that lie about getting rid of Obamacare they lie about securing the border they lie about taxes they live all by the time\n\nBut that is okay because that's part of their quote unquote pro fashion\n... got to thinking to myself who was one of the biggest drinkers\nWinston Churchill\nBig smoker drinker Winston Churchill these mental midgets who call themselves Democrats in Congress couldn't hold a candle to Winston Churchill\nAnd they can't hold a candle to Brett Kavanaugh and look I'm Still not a hundred percent sure he's a Scalia typewriter Thomas type but I Know he's not it Ruth Bader Ginsburg type and right now that's fine by me\nBecause this like the battle over the election to protect the president from a coup is the same damn battle it's the same damn thing\n\nLook how half your country wants to throw due process out the window look\nHalf your country wants to throw the presumption of innocence out your window look out half the country wants to use a high school and you all as a basis for destroying them at we are not required to follow the insane off the edge of the ladies and gentlemen\n\nNow when we return let's look at again\nSome of these details that demonstrate that Dr Ford is not credible\nAs applies to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I keep hearing also that the Democrats have done her no favors ladies and gentleman that they have exploited her that may have been true early on but it's not true now\nIt's not true now and this guy Jeff Flake\nHe's a bad Andre he is a dishonest man and I'll get back to him later we'll be right back [noise]

B. and I heard a radio station\n[noise]\n\nMark Levin a champion of liberty true conservatism on the call mark no paid seven seven three one two three a one was so Dr Ford\nHas had four different accounts someone this place the years to accounts on how old she was two sets of therapists notes that don't name judge Kavanaugh\n\nNo explanation whatsoever for how she got to where she got to how she left where she left she doesn't remember who invited her to the party doesn't remember how she got there doesn't remember how she left\nThose are important details I'd say that she knows she only had one beer and was not on any medicate so she remembers those details\nOf Dr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she her self identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nShe's named three people other than judge Kavanaugh who attended the party mark judge Patrick PJ ... her lifelong friendly Lynn Kaiser and by the way or the media have twisted\nOver the weekend with Kaiser and her lawyer put out their twisted when in fact it changed nothing\n\nDrunks and the perverts in the media have twist at all this oh yeah there's a lot of drunks and perverts in the media audit drunks and perverts in Congress not drunks and perverts in the Democratic party some of the Republican Party two\nAnd a\nDoctor forward testified that committee that another boy tend to the party but she couldn't remember his name know others have come forward so no driver has come forward\nAnother boy has not come forward\nNone of the people she named could corroborate what she said you know the case of labeling Kaiser her lifelong friend she doesn't even remember meeting Kavanaugh\n\nDoes it get any weaker than this does any can't anymore insane than this\nAll three named witnesses have submitted statements that committee denying any memory of the party whatsoever no this is interesting to me\nNow they submitted those statements I assume under penalty of perjury so they better hope that their statements that they're giving to the FBI are consistent with what they've told the committee see the way I Know a an investigation normally occur is\nIs there's not all the publicity and so forth and so on so witnesses of shaky memories\nAnd so forth and so on\nThey start to clarify quote unquote their thoughts because of the media attention because of lawyers because part of sins and so forth and so on so it gets harder and harder to get to the truth\nBut it'll be interesting to compare what they provided to this committee and what they're saying to the FBI wouldn't most relevant Lee in her first statement to the committee ms Kaiser\nHer lifelong girlfriends state it through council that quote simply put ms Kaiser does not know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without doctor for it\nQuote unquote\nIn a subsequent statements of the committee through counseling as Kaiser said that quote the simple I'm I'm changeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate Dr forwards allegations because she has no recollection of the incident in question\n\nMore over Dr Ford testify that are friendly Lynn apparently the only other girl the party did not follow up with Dr Ford after the party to ask her why she had suddenly disappeared\n\nNow let me just stop you there let's just do it the preponderance of the information so far leans in who's favor as a producer says who's favorite dessert leaning\nCapital hands down hands down\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault writes the prosecutor\nAccording to her letter that Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone so in her letter the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony\nShe could not hear them talking to anyone in her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other person's at the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... actually with a judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but\nShe maintain that she could not hear their conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\nWhether you're a sniper or whether you even see this psychologist in Germany and Denmark gave the test to

about we want an FBI\nInvestigation you know why they do that to you so you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those are real live criminal investigation now there's not\nThis has nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested to two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that\nAsk Dr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not\nWhat a

interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flight not one of them\nSaid you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\nBecause they're afraid that's why\nYou're here this now on Fox I'm short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK I'm used to this\nBut\nIt's an important point\nHe said because in a court of law it's like having all does have the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law which a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt but as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her\nPaper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum\nAnd everybody's gathered because now the lines are going to kill the Christian just throw Kavanaugh in there from in their everybody's

statute of limitations would not have run and has not\nRun in Montgomery County Maryland not one and I'll tell you something else [noise] one of the\nReasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation she would lose\nEven on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence if he sued Mrs Ramirez she would lose if he sued avid ... and his crime they would lose\nYou can accuse people of the most vital things with no evidence with no witnesses it no\nCorroborate ... it's a slam dunk\nNot might take a few years but\nThey know he won't they know he can't given his interest in still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit\nThese accusers and their lawyers and the Democrats in Congress fear the

remember who invited her to the party doesn't remember how she got there doesn't remember how she left\nThose are important details I'd say\nThat she knows she only had one beer and was not on any medication so she remembers those details\n\nOh Dr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she herself identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nShe's named three people other than judge Kavanaugh who attended the party mark judge Patrick PJ ... air lifelong friendly Lynn Kaiser and by the way or the media have twisted\nOver the weekend with Kaiser and her lawyer put out their twisted when in fact that changed nothing\n\nThe drunks and the perverse acts in the media have twist at all this oh yeah there's a lot of drunks and perverts in the media out of drunks and perverts in Congress about a drunks in perverts in the Democratic party some of the Republican Party two\nAnd a\nDoctor for testified that committee that another boy tend to the party but she couldn't remember his name know others have come forward so no driver has come forward\nAnother boy has not come forward\nNone of the people she named could corroborate what she said and then the case of labeling Kaiser her lifelong friend she doesn't even remember meeting Kevin\n\nDoes it get any weaker than this isn't it can't anymore insane than this\nAll three named witnesses have submitted statements that committee denying any memory of the party whatsoever no this is interesting to me\nNow they submitted those statements I assume under penalty of perjury so they better hope that their statements that they're giving to the FBI are consistent with what they've told the committee see the way I Know a a an investigation normally occur is\nIs there is not all the publicity and so forth and saw so witnesses of shaky memories\nAnd so forth and so on\nThey start to clarify quote unquote their thoughts because of the media attention because of lawyers because part of ... and so forth and so on so it gets harder and harder to get to the truth\n\nBut I really interesting to compare what they provided to this committee and what they're saying to the FBI wouldn't most relevant Lee in her first statement to the committee ms Kaiser\nHer lifelong girlfriends state it through council that quote simply put ms Kaiser does not know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without Dr Ford\nQuote unquote\nIn a subsequent statement to the committee through counseling as Kaiser said that quote the simple I'm On changeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate Dr Ford's allegations because she has no recollection of the incident in question\n\nMore over Dr Ford testify that are friendly Lynn apparently the only other girls the party did not follow up with Dr Ford after the party to ask her why she had suddenly disappeared\nNow let me just stop you there let's just do it the preponderance of the information so far leans in whose favorite ... says who's favoritism ...\nCapital hands down hands down\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault writes the prosecutor according to her letter that Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well\nShe was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone so in her letter the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other persons with the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... excuse me the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear their conversation with others when
