I'll I'll I'll go get their act research staff on that one as we take a look at tomorrow's games that we saw in Miami lose tonight to Boston College to suddenly turnover chain is not nearly what it was a year ago but some are obviously you'll get Florida Georgia the big Markey game on the schedule look Florida is one of those teams I think every college football fan goes\nYeah but on the really that's good yeah but are they really there's good and we're going to find out tomorrow\nYeah the answer is probably not quite yet I mean it's you remember where they were last year I mean this was a bad bad team uh nothing was working at all with the team walking with Jim ... to be fired\nAnd they turned around fast you know it's not that easy I mean Tennessee's not turning around in a heartbeat nebraskan UCLA\nYou know certainly weren't able to flip this fast\nBut then ... will step and it was a good situation they didn't ask to a completely you know got got the building here for this thing they just need to tweak a little bit as it turns out yeah they are this good they are okay\nBut Georgia's ... one of the top four teams in the country so tomorrow's really that day where we kind of see okay now this clears up a little bit so either it's one of those days where we kind of clear out the you know the riffraff a little bit alright Kentucky let's see what you do it in Missouri Texas you got to go to Oklahoma State\nYou know Iowa and Penn State there are couple which uh one last teams out there that are going to be hanging around and after he put an article that I write in conversations that All right we'll see if you're still hang around after this week\nWell that's one of the things obviously me and in the Big Ten you got\nThe Iowa Penn State game well Wisconsin North West we'll get to that later a Penn State a team you know Jason taking a baseball bat you out of out of you and Cajun Iowa Stanley sixteen and six almost sixteen hundred yards mix surely has been fantastic in spots\nOf Iowa on the road ... out of state hold up\nAt Penn State now we have to look at them through a different lens because All right that the one big performance against Ohio State in the last but they've not really done a whole lot else I mean you lose to Michigan State you know they need everything in the bag to get by Appalachian State it's been a good team they blew up some bad teams\nBut no no we find out because I was good\nThe bad match up for Penn State ... meets families who played really well or the office of light is starting to figure it out that defense is great against the ... so a mix are always going to have to be amazing\nThe guy wins I think they keep going I I've said for weeks I think I Will win the big tent west but we're gonna see tomorrow if they can really get because they went tomorrow they're running the table and they're going to be a Lebanon one then it just comes down to whether or not was caught is going to lose again\nI'd give me an upset tomorrow you wouldn't be surprised top twenty five if what happened tomorrow\nI wouldn't be out of my mind shocked to Florida beats Georgia because it is a you know it's a rivalry game and as you start Texas Oklahoma sometimes those things sort of in\nA northwestern it might be Wisconsin because north western has a a little bit of a ... over the badgers in al ... is in the concussion protocol and I'm actually going to the\nGame where you know you go at all or do you mean that it's probably going to be thirty four degrees and raining or whether it\nWas a little bit and I write this evening in some parts of the suburbs\nLittle bit yeah so it's a family find out but I uh I think Texas loses to Oklahoma State I have it there's nothing really to go on that other than Texas is due for a ... one of these clunkers to go the wrong way and Oklahoma states do to have a good game especially with two weeks off so uh Oklahoma State over Texas is kind of my one for tomorrow\nAbout navy mixing hangs up just enough to make it interesting I mean obviously a twenty four point wide\nBut yeah interesting as you say interesting if you like the ... for a lot of points against an option to you but this isn't the navy team in the last few years it's not as Chris but defense isn't nearly as good and they know the names had two weeks off but\nThis starts a run for games in five where the Irish are away from South bend and there's just a quirky and if the schedule there's this game in San Diego\nThere's the Syracuse came in Yankee Stadium they got to come back out to LA or the west coast or to play USC late in the season are still going to come down to Evanston employee northwestern I mean there's a lot of land mines left\nA and you don't want to lose it now because this is not

need to get to next week for five games that are interesting\nBut next week Alabama LSU we start seeing things get serious as you get down to three games before the end of the ... and that's going to be the big one that that you see All right what kind of game is this going to be is finally are we going to see Alabama playing close game is that once you lose is how far do they dropped down can they still get two teams in the play off\nEverything was going the Dodgers way it looked like everybody was loved asleep\nAnd boy Jackie Bradley junior got to pitch right out over the heart of the plate and he just hammered it into the stands in right field the red Sox dug out is blazing right now electric and I don't I don't want people to think I'd be like they're all like no no no no they are just so easy to here in\nRight now when you were all happy and in your mellow phase Jackie Bradley junior he's keep on keep it on right now no that's right he's watching a\nChance and obviously this was one of the big issues during the regular season yet health concerns and then you add the performance of giving up the teen home runs this year in his sixty nine appearances he'd only give it up six or fewer and every other season in his major league baseball career and\nIt kills what was a great stat for Walker I mean there's still exist obviously Walker be alert but it's a little less exciting now that you have a tie game and that you will join a rare company seven scoreless innings or better to hit your fewer and zero walk to the world series game he becomes the third\nMember of that club with Roger Clemens game two of the year two thousand and then Don Larsen we keep referencing yeah with each game you had to go all the way back in ...\nAnd for Jackie Bradley his tenth RBI the postseason every RBI with two outs and the red Sox continue their two out RBI run so here we are a bit of a shock or going on right now Boston the Dodgers one one in the top of the eighth inning but\nIn the NFL this week it may be the biggest match up is a loser leave town elimination 'bout because when you think about the magic number it takes to get to the playoffs in the national football the the\nNumber six is a big red numbers circle by everybody you go ten and six you'll make the playoffs anything outside of ...\nSuddenly\nYou're likely not making it once in a while\nCan you can at nine and seven yeah you can but\nTeams are going to win ten games and you leave it outside of your hands you get to that magic number six it's a very big deal Sunday the eagles and the jaguars the game it starts early 'cause it's at ... stadium you have both of these teams sitting at three and four and tremendously under achieving\nNow granted the loser is only going to be three and five but you have to stop at this point by saying oh this is going to go on a run actually going to run you're talking about then the second half of the season these teams can lose one game one game and still make the playoffs\nThat's how serious things get when you get the five losses you can only afford to lose one more game and you keep saying all the eagles or the chance they'll figure it out all the jaguars when the AFC title game last year they'll figure it out they haven't figured out yet\nThere is no magic pill there's nobody coming to anybody's rescue the loser of this game will not make the playoffs in the NFL tell you that right now well you go down the degree of\nDifficulty in terms of your schedule such as hey we got X number of games left for the eagles is not an easy road and you've got the cowboys coming off the buying a couple of weeks then you have\nThe saints on the road\nThe giants whatever they are at this point to games left with the red skins who are currently atop the division you got the rams\nYou you have another game with the cowboys by that point you fully acclimated I'm already Cooper I don't know what that means I mean we're still waiting to see\nA when it's all said and done but opportunity there and then your Houston Texans mixed in there as well but the jaguars how much is Carlos Hyde able to stabilize thing when you got a quarterback that you don't believe in you've already bench and now you're doing all the\nWay here's your vote of confidence ahead of a trip overseas it's just a bad business right now in the defense a shell of its former self\nSo this is where you're at I'm going to say I know it's kind of another home game\nFor the jaguars bought the eagles find a way to win a close one they have the better quarterback\nThe eagles staying there the better team and the jaguars season continues to spiral out of control well I think I also get points for Cory climate during an interview and saying hey this is zombie Corey climate right now because he ... he was having trouble so I'll give the bonus points to that\nTwitter about how about a ...
