down and ate for the Panthers a formation Monticello stacked up\nAt the line of scrimmage and brought down\nThem back awkwardly right there and we'll get to see him or get up to tackle Sackler up high but he had some traffic down around his legs and kind of bent over funny where sometimes you can see a a near ankle injury but luck luckily for Pascagoula nothing happening and that's in that arena and Carson palace back on [noise]\nThird down\nAnd seven at the twenty nine yard line the breakup\nPatterson number Twenty one from Biloxi they're built another saltwater keep looking up and down the rosters lotta sophomores on biloxi's roster [noise]\nPascagoula comes to the line on the left fashion moving left to right to start the third quarter\nMake fake the hand off now than it was a complete and he has a first down in more or less barred well on the run the full back inside the forty and near the thirty still on his feet and goes down at the dirty yellow blonde what a pitch and catch from Maine to barred well and that is a first down for good luck at the\nDirty and that is again of twenty forty one yards\nBill me Rosie all frozen defensive look they look\nTo the left froze the defense from Biloxi didn't look back to his writing bar was slipped out of the\nBill for a little screen had miles blocking down field and for what a big pick up for past\nAll of their own third and along the move deep into the electric territory down to the and the answer to your life\nAnd that's one of those plays when you run at Seventy eight times the game you can get a pass like that every now and then and there's a hand off to Kirkland who goes forward for nine yards on the first down and then in turn if you complete a play like that it opens up the running game back to you it's a full circle\nTommy victim eight nearly nine and as you mentioned bill that was after contact Kirkland up Kirkland running hard started up the middle of broke over to the left side spun off a couple of with the fact was from India and got down to a very manageable second one and I tell you what there's not a coach at any level\nTake nine yards on first down\nThat's right in Kirkland put his finger in the air right when he got up after that non yard game\nAnd there is a hand off off the metal he is inside of Fifteen down to the twelve for a first down ...\nAsking really got to Biloxi defense on their heels a little bit writers from primarily by the screenplay a moment ago on the third and last and now back to\nPickups of nine plus yours my Kirkland consecutive place Pascagoula and the red zone now down to the twelve yard line\nNon over a left in the third quarter\n\nIn Pascagoula has first and ten at the Thirteen tied with Biloxi at seven Kirkland trying to find running room and can't and thrown backwards at the lime he did get forward momentum for two yards\nLike it might have been a little mix up in the backfield their bills are between ... and\nKirkland not sure\nIf that was the design of the play but one one appear to be going left and the other appear to go right through the timing of just a bit as you've mentioned ... was able to pick up a couple of yours but something just want to skew in the in the exchange there in the backfield\nSomehow got two yarns amazing and now\nIt will be second down in eight from the ten\nMinutes under center hands off the Kirkland straight ahead trying to power his ways only one sixty and he is trying to power his way forward and goes down\nIt will be thirty five for the Panthers there\nYou know as well as anybody when you're in a primary primarily\nA office of attack\nWhen you're out in the middle of the field little little easier going because there's so much feel to defend the closer you get to the goal or makes it more and more difficult to run that football as a\nThird town in five a formation\nPitch goes to Kirkland running outside trying to get around the end that he can't excellent tackle about Jordan ... gum or any of the luxury denying them and ... ... in the field go unit on the field and this is an opportune time for three you\nMentioned in a very secure attack all out there by Biloxi are wrapping up

out trying to run around the end and then run out of bounds and he will not get the first down in Pascagoula will have to point it looks like Jimmy gamble might be coming in to punt this one\nYeah I like to play called they're building the only thing I Would have liked the same problem you've been run it left all life if you're going to face it all up maybe roll your quarterback out the the other direction and try to go against the flow but a good safe play you can't open your playbook too deep uh when you're in the shadow of your own go versus other than you are a lot of good conservative place\nTo go find it away and put it on the shoulders or does\nShe mean gamble into part of the way we need that big leg to come out right here he's standing midway in the end zone and it gets the pun away and it's a high kick\nAway from the return man and it takes a huge bulldogs the balance I'm Talking about straight backwards that's just unfortunate it bounces all the way back to the twenty five yard line wow\nIt's only going to be a ... yard farm for a shutdown their bill but it ... it back up probably fifty yards it landed up near the thirty seven thirty at your\nI mean it was a great it was a good point and I you know and you know people at home or going how could\nI don't know is is this answer I can give you um you just you know he's ... he's in his mind is like get this phone off get this off and then he\nHe actually kicked into high and away from the return man and it was a great location of the pie it it just bounce backwards first in ten Biloxi at the twenty four actually wow\nTrailing by three they sent demand in motion from the near side to the far side and he hands up and pitches it back to the other receiver who's throws it for a judge down a reverse fleet fleet flicker\nAre more like a reverse pass and it is caught\nFor the touchdown sugar ration to the nth degree and Bullock she takes the lead\nActually do reverse fast bill the editor you go to run a man and motion who aren't handed it to the other receiver who came back\nAnd I thought developing right away the inside of receiver on the rise up and go straight down the field there was not a fan third within fifty yards of it all they had to do is throw the ball easy pitch get for a touchdown and that was the time to strike right after that unfortunate events on the\n\nHolding on Biloxi oh manic\nBreak for basketball right there because you know even mentioned it and the call or not the person that got enough your judge for the first down and that's going to bring that one back\nWhile the Indian coaches are furious I mean they say you could call holding on every play is just how you sell it\nFor the differences that was out at the point of a ...\nCorner of ... you know inside where the guys are going after each other you probably could call\nIf you if you're holding somebody back from getting outside that's holding yes so here is third down in seven because it came it went from the spot so its third down in seven Biloxi at the forty seven\nThey send a man in motion he goes slowly in motion now stops and fears is going to try to run it for a first down again a jobs and I think his me it's going to be short of the first while they gave him an excellent spot over there\nI mean a great spot\nIn the past ... defense on that side of the football field they were waiting for ... to get to them they needed to go attack a runner possibly could have made a tackle shorter than\nThan where they did is going to be very close\nIt was a good call by the Indians to run Pearson to the wide side of the field and now it is short short the fourth down in one with two minutes left Pascagoula still not calling time out because you feel like you've got to hold him here no matter what [noise]\nGoodness\nLook says oh Bullock says probably going to let this play clock run all the way down and then maybe call a timeout one fifty left to go now [noise]\n\nAnd time out Biloxi will take

pitcher pitching nine innings giving up a home run and the first\nAnd losing one nothing I just kind of what Pascagoula tonight that one flight double reverse pass for a touchdown is the difference in this game and the Panthers lose fourteen attend to the Indians\nYeah they they all count bill as far as your age I mean you look at the end of that you look at how old are yours but you're saying but electric did not go up and down the field as well on off as as\nMove the ball in office but that one quick strike and I came here came after the special teams play the ... and\nPerfect timing for the the trick play\nI think if you get if you're doing the checks like Jimmy the Greek used to do a fence both have a ... defense both have it checked special James check to Biloxi yeah you might have

buddy I mean it was the LeBron James in a big boy otherwise see the reverse about rings only go so far\nJimmy buckets does not get along well with Minnesota timber wolves ownership guy who's an all star caliber player he's probably at the second level of star players in the NBA and there was that elite level of guys and then there's the next level of star players which there was a few but Jimmy Butler certainly is that how did a player\nThought he was going to be part of the timber wolves ... a cornerstone of part of the team going forward instead he wants out because\nHe doesn't trust timber mills management this is a very highly publicized war over the course of the pre season he stayed away from the team he comes back to practice very odd day and when she comes in and takes the\nEnd of the bench guys and beat the starters in his scrimmage yells to the GM Scott Layton you Lincoln need me on this team I Wish he would yell you leap and ruin the Nixon the two thousands

don't the ins the absolute insides of the war between Jimmy Butler\nAnd timber wolves ownership nobody knows besides Jimmy Butler and a couple of guys involved but just from the standpoint of yeah I don't care booming you need me and I'm going to prove to you is this is not a scrimmage where I take\nThe temp delivered the twelve guys on the bench and and run circles around the stardust here's opening night where you know without me maybe lose the bleeping cabs without LeBron James instead yeah\nNine out of ten this is one of the great Blake you performances and all of sports in fact after

right now the ran the rams are going to be good if they are six into last night we saw\nWe saw the chiefs and we know the chiefs are going to be good even though they lost last night I feel like we actually learn more about the chiefs than we did the patriots\nKeys are going to be good I felt like the chargers are going to be good if you look at who the chargers of lawsuit they've lost to the rams and they have lost to the chiefs those are two really good teams I feel like the chargers by and large are going to be good\nI felt like New Orleans and it's going to be pretty good even though they lost in week one to the ... they put up forty two points I felt like the chargers we can rely on to be good\nI'm not sure we can rely on anybody else based on what we've seen there's evidence that the team can be awful people saying the patriots therefore and to the patriots were awful against the alliance the patriots were awful against the jak\nThose are not two very good football teams

of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside for a minute if you asked the men on the street named me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be\nBuilding that wall and protecting our border and Republicans I understand why in some cases\nBut Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you it's because the Democrats stood in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was\nOf a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written [noise]\nWar is because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get

I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them to get their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step I'm Larry O'Connor infer mark Levin hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys though I've watched I've watched the\nBorder over the years grew up in Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a here they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and then you have people standing in line trying to do with the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know they're all it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA you remember that and it was a parody song and they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and\nIt was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run from border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him\nRight if oh if only that really were the case in fact what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean there have been there forever I mean obviously it's not no longer with us but uh\nIt just they slowly that came

want to have you know four or five ... go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA uh people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't that they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I could get a\nHold on I'm sure there's a lot\nThere here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job and they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition\nThey are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they've got a job that means they buy their lied\nAbout their documentation or they were using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument is a complete and total nonsense [noise] if\nSomeone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThey are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had been truly and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this

falls pole and ah [noise] are convinced selfish showing and Flanders also discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd the overall media onslaught fish discourage many conservatives those on the right from voting mhm they're only about Seventy percent of the u._s. citizens can years for an older voted for President Trump the primary\nIn about twenty five percent of the general for you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting I think actually most of them were both conservative is they're going to have voted\nYet it can do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that uh I I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent they they're I mean one of the last time they were accurate\nYeah well I think often that's probably the case for similar to the fore Anders that people don't actually believe the frontrunners for what they believe is that other people will believe him and they won't get out the vote share they think that\nThat lives in ... that is definitely the danger and and and Ken thank you for the call out there in LA uh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying and going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the the cabin on\nHearing I still believe resonates and I do want to believe that that was a motivating factor for people\nI think and and and and back to our topic of the hour that caravan\nI think when people turn on their television and

people to start time just showing them\nPictures of of ah Maxine\nWaters holding a gamble as the new chairwoman financial services that's what we're going to get how about this this joker walking Castro who floated conspiracy theory about uh about Jared Kushner\nAiding in the alleged murder\nOf this columnist from the Washington Post ... ... a ... he's a rising star he could run for president really is that what we want for the next two years you realize how bad things could get what would you be doing if you were rising Republicans right now in the final days of this campaign\nEight seven seven three one ... one one Larry O'Connor here sitting in for the great one mark within by the way we have a a breaking story here out of the Associated Press or the Saudi state run news agency\nIs now reporting that prosecutors are saying that ... was killed in the Saudi consulate\nIn a fight there was a fight\nIn the Saudi consulate in Turkey where this allegedly took place ... was killed this is according to Saudi state run news agency so take it for what it is worth [noise] um that's a heck of a fight that's if if it's if if the reporting up until now has been accurate it was what Eighteen to one\nAnd um\nThen where's this body by the way what kinda [noise] you know we will we will see how that story develops um [noise]\nBut it's all everything that is in the news right now\nHas to do with the midterm elections we're going to talk about this crisis at our border coming up in a bit actually interview to\nA democratic senator from Maryland been carton about this issue and I'm going to play some of that in her ... you for you because you have to hear how Democrats are talking about this thing they will not answer questions it's a very simple question okay you want to be a senator you want to be a congressman you are currently and you're running for reelection here's my question what\nDo you do with these thousands and thousands of people from foreign\nNations storming our border demanding entry where are we really need to do better economic development in those countries so that they have better conditions and they do that\nNo that's okay too late for that what do you do today what do you do right now on our border\nWell we need to increase the border security is what we know oh you mean a wall no no no no no no we don't want to wall but we need to increase border security so that we can do with the okay so you want to spend\nBillions of dollars on more border control what are they going to do because your policies\nUp until now is if somebody crosses our border and says I Want to sign\nAnd then you hand them a slip of paper that says okay well see in a couple of months for your hearing how bad it\nIs do we still do or do you turn them around and send them home do you not let them in do you arrest them for breaking our our laws\nDo you detained them at the border and if you do no one's willing to step up and say the very real truth

go to a chief in Titusville, Pennsylvania cut\nFive percent across the board I Wonder how much money that will say the U.S taxpayer and why no one's talking about it\nSo you think Republicans should be a touting that they should say look you keep us empower we're going to help the president reduce the budget across the board\nOh absolutely and not only that as we should be eliminating multiple federal departments\nThere's a lot of state departments that are doing the same thing that the federal departments are doing everything has a department of education department of agriculture and the the way that the federal level is incredible and no one's talking about downsizing\nThe federal government and reducing the cost to operate the federal government and he announced that the other day and it's getting no play and I just like to know why\nThanks Keith well it's not getting a lot of play because of all the way in terms of the news coverage is because the news focuses on what they choose to focus about\nAll of the great news and the economy with regard to jobs with regard to Wall Street with regard to profits with regard to manufacturing they're not paying any attention to that either a key thank you for the call and and the other beauty or of of what the president has done here is that he is bypassing capitalism Congress\nCan set the law they can set their budget they can appropriate funding but the executive branch actually does uh do the spending right they do the hiring they do the actual operation of these federal agencies", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin
