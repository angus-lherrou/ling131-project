{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "Few weeks back we covered kind of the age groups of how many people have loans and what the size of that book of loans looks like and yeah that day's coming that if they're not making payments and\nUh I don't know I I've heard some big numbers on the mouth that's in default and it's pretty big out there in these things do not go away you can't file bankruptcy\nAnd it just you know we were having a conversation\nOn Monday that this was brought up and you know and and I ... at that time I kind of\nDefined as people aren't just taken borrowing money to take care of their tuition they're doing other things with the money in which I defined it is their finite financing college\nLifestyle or standard of living I kind of just it would be college life style is what they're financing coast they're ... they're not\nLoving on them in a mental mom's just getting by but they're living the lifestyle\nAnd they're gonna have to pay later and one thing they didn't do the math on it and it's it's it's not a lot different than\nRetirement when you when you talk you know one of the key questions is how much do you think you'd need\nFor your world to go and I'll just aspect differently how much are you going to need a mug shots to pay your bills and everything to go well\nAnd and that's a kind of a bottom line question oh I don't know well\nTell me what your outflow averages on your checking account pushed somehow you bring money in and it flows out and that's typically done by checking account so if you know the bottom line number then you kinda know what your net need is so with that kind of like I Need\nFour thousand a mock to pay the bills\nBut in two years it's going to go down by a thousand a month because the house is going to get paid for\nSo that takes twelve thousand off that so now we're thirty\nSix thousand net so water we need on a gross number you're probably I'll add for granted that so you're needing about forty owner gross numbers so why didn't assets does it take to generate that wealth from festival last that\nYou know you need at least a million dollars\nOh but I've got a pension from the military I and I'm\nGoing to be full retirement age at this point so then those factories because those other sources of income\nReducing that so you can figure out what it's going to take in\nOh I don't have enough money\nBecause we can't generate income to cover that so then that's kind of a spin them so on the other way when you're borrowing the money they're not looking at what's the minimum that I Need I've got to stick to that\nAnd maybe work on weekends or something you know did you weren't going to school when you were going to college yeah I did too I had several things going on ... jobs\nLawn mowing ... flipping cars whatever would generate money away tables and I was I Move or I was\nIn the move or move I had some friends those move movers great money I couldn't do that it was horrible job at great money yeah but it was horrible\nSo if they start factor and like that and then they should look at how much are you going to end up borrowing over that for years if you get it done it for years and hopefully so five years could wreck you\nFinancially but when you think about well I'm going to need Fifteen thousand a year\nOr more to borrow that\nSome might be twenty but you know what the math is it's four years that's sixty thousand dollars\nAnd we have an added in interest\nAnd they're gonna start morning pavement shortly after you get us get what it what does that look like well I I Know and then what do you think you're going to make that comes to the next guy 'cause how are we going to pay that\nWhile I was wanting to get married to this girl when I finished school I don't know can you afford a place in a car to get to work I Know you can't afford a honeymoon no that's not help and you can't afford the ring unless your financing it in your lifestyle college loans\nAs little more debt and who cares [laughter] well here's a here's a scenario I sell far too often is people are finishing college and this these big loans or come and do they have sixty eighty thousand dollars and they know what their payments are going to be and they can't turn around and get a job is going to support their lifestyle and this big student loan debt payment but\nIf they go get their master's degree then they don't have to start making the payments yet\nAnd then you compound to the ... steak there I've had many people to regret doing that because that just cruise alone so much and the compounding\nOf the debt and we're going to talk about this more tomorrow but this needs to be an extended conversation was somebody's doing that to figure out what it's going to be and how you're going to pay for it and can you make money in that profession to do so\nYou know we we haven't heard a story about somebody working at angle shipyard making sixty thousand a year living at home out of high school it was Twenty years old yeah\nAnd and making great money and has upside they're working for companies that has great benefits and he's going to try to have I think two hundred thousand saved\nIn what four years\nMaybe it'll take 'em five but really talking about being from twenty to twenty five and have a couple of hundred K. on hand that serious stuff the other topic I was wanting to talk about tonight is having a lot more\nConversations about pension law subs and I was asked a question today that was interesting because the gentleman has the\nOption that he can take a lump sum versus the monthly pension income and he was saying you know if you take the pension what about inflation and the future and higher interest rates how does that factor in to it\nAnd let's just say his four oh one K. was three times the size of\nHis lump sum pension option and I said look and the percentage based on the lump sum offering the monthly check that he was going to receive basically is an annual payout a five and a half percent and I said that's pretty good number from a guarantee\nCreates a stable base and nobody can mess it up\nYou know I got to turn it over to some\nGuy that's not a fiduciary and have mistakes or have a market crash or what and and effect\nMoney but that I sit in this sense it locks down I said you have three times that amount of money\nTo put to work that have a combination and create balanced between equities and save money but have the money working that can grow in the future that can create that income generation that is going to increase over time and keep pace with inflation\nSo this isn't just a simple conversation and when you're going to have that with somebody and next thing they do is yeah you should take the lump sum we're going to do this this mess to we got to work through the math and it's an extended conversation\nAnd I'll say we it ends up being about fifty fifty but a lot of times where say you know\nUse this as the guaranteed portion of retirement and then put the other money to work on top of it to\nFeel the need of increased income in the future if you're wanting to have conversations like this I Do have a daytime job I'm a financial advisor money manager we're going to help you find where you're on the path and where you're headed\nAll you've got to do is called office federal for

... Fox News President Trump called on the country to come together after the raid the packages containing pipe bombs are sent to high ranking Democrat and CNN's New York offices\nWith a weapon and they were shot I mean somebody was actually shot\n\nI get death threats\nRush gets death threats Hannity gets death threats but I Know I get death threats\nIt's not fun\nIt's not fun and you worry about your family you're worried about you know you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid just you had to be a little bit more careful\n\nBut wanting teeth all is out there in ... is filled with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplayed same of black lives matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such close up to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded so they have these are these packages and these devices\nAre in their ah original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys are ...\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience with the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they they're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of\nIt that's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously is the threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why\nCan't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see the question do building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or Steve ... says about him\n\nThe other day the president et cetera rallies in a rally I think it was used and then he says he's a nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\nAnd they try and tired\nTo Nazi ism or ... or ... style these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party notice when people proclaim if they're socialists they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist\nSocialist right they didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using style on his language no of course not\n\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves so for them now the sit back\nFor the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC on CNN for the most radical among them on the today show or good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump went absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think the media in this country over the last two years have been responsible do you think the media in this country but the last two years have been measured you'd think the media in this country many in the media in this country cross the line with their references\nTo Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\n\nDo you think Joe Scarborough was cross the line or make emergency or Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on you think they cross the line with their heated rhetoric would they're poisoning language\nAnd now\nThey're going to tell you [noise] calm down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having stoke the flames now they're the firefighters\nAnd same with ... the things that she is said and same with Schumer the things that he has said and the things that they did to a guy like Kavanaugh to a guy like cabinet\n\nTo create the tensions in this society and the anger in this society do they have any responsibility for it\n\nWell if Donald Trump though surely they do I'll

the topics and twice that\nYou make our our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe\nFortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh that what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um [noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them the you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nMhm and I find very interesting a fight and I don't know if I can share on the\nWith you while let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back in New York\nTo lock and monitor skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Aristotle and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with and of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these ...\nThere is ideologies and theories and extraction in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities they are primary\nNow are viewed as a view it that way conformity in uniform me there's not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's\nOur model and so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is eight and a government\nPower uh but that is essentially sees by unelected individuals and they will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's\nTaking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what America did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happened here on the American left is they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are progeny so but of haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All
