I'm doing well on the side to supplement my income\nAnd I'm doing pretty good so I Am a decent amount of money\nAnd I want to know number one how much money I can make without affecting my Social Security in other words it it they will take it away and the second part of this question is how they find out how much money than I Am making\n\nAll right so I a quick search is being had over here on Gregory is laptop\nAnd how will they find out is an interesting question because implied in there is is there a chance they won't find out\nI Will never under operate under that as a model there but I imagine Hoover had some sort of reporting process as much as governments around the country has been you know putting their heel on those guys\nThey're probably starting to cooperate in ways that I wouldn't even begin to risk not reporting that into\nBut ah as far as the specific numbers on how much you can make and if and when it'll affect your benefit that's going to have to be afraid I agree\nYou know if they're going to find the one who respond to get the knock on the dark guy listen I'm making this much money they want to take them away from from whatever I don't know I mean why why that is that what that was my point\nCourting the Social Security administration private pension and insurance benefits do not affect Social Security disability payments payment such as the administration benefit some state and local benefits unemployment benefits supplemental Social Security income do not report\nReduce a person's ss the guy there is a male that you can make and then you're okay with I don't have that number in front of me that's something you could call the office\nAnd we will drill down and get a little bit further to you I just can't pull gather that information\nFor you quickly but you can make some earned income gosh and I just top of my head it seems like you'd make a thousand mosques somewhere in that range there's some allowable amount before it starts affecting your disability [noise]\nLet's see um I my ... looks like a earnings more than ... eleven eighty a month\nOr you know ... you know I was right about a thousand a month but it's about almost twelve hundred a month you can earn without it affecting your disability benefits if you're blind you can make almost two thousand a month but it's kind of be hard to be a new job or drive ran be blind\nSo I don't know if that's helping you they're like thank you for the call as going to say we're probably France on blind drivers\nYeah [noise] I Will pick up the rest of our

anybody down I'm just saying that's what I saw\nSo I take exception the some out there I I thought she did a hell of a job it was very solid that was her purpose that's what she did that's what she accomplished and she she had to synthesize understand and then use an enormous amount of information a very short time and she did\nAnd she found gaps\nAre that's me from September twenty seventh last
