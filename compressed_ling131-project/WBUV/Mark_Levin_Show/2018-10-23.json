aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turned out we went\n[noise] yeah early voting in Texas and started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now I really don't put this off get out there in voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left to try in a in a change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early\nAnd the more people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raised a and it is a a you know high and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good tax and we feel good but we\nFeel that it's necessary for everybody to show up\nIn order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal who served in the United States Army and I think of her service but he uses that to try to claim centrism to claim independent that he's running in his dad\nBut there is nothing ... nothing independent about somebody who was already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump who's already said that he would undo the tax cuts\nIt was already said that he would put in place a carbon tax is already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run as a centrist and he's not but I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke\nA efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\n[noise] and a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much are worth seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others\nAre the Democrats very purposely without recruited leftists who could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism\nDoesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why would better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of these socialist things were at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate\nBut they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the only way is to go came up when they had people over the Chuck Schumer and the rest of the left is on the coast who are trying to buy off Texas with thirty eight million dollars of money\nUsed discount code mark\n[noise] more than what I've seen it on my Web show\nOh a and a and I\nHave to check your state for early voting\nIs very simple to do I think those early voting in Florida right now I Would strongly encourage you to get out there\nI mean do you really have choices are in some of these states Texas you have these radicals versus these constitutional conservatives you've got the same in Florida this guy Gillum just pretending to be a moderate is pretending to be ah what's the big deal or you know\nTo Santa's show boating I'm not for that he has a radical leftists Bernie Sanders guy\n\nAnd I I Know there's a lot of liberals in Florida there's a lot of non liberals too\n\nI mean if you really want that kind of government just moved back to New York\nOr New Jersey\nOr Illinois these blue states are all over the place where they killed businesses and kill jobs and have massive tax rates and so forth I mean I don't understand people flee those states they go to red states and then they vote make those states purple if not blue it's crazy\n\nIt's irrational but then again the liberals so that explains a lot\n\nFalls officially here I actually love the fall I Love the cooler temperatures the breeze I don't like the winter I Can't stand the winter can't stand the snow quite frankly actually like the heat like in Florida but I like the fall to fall is officially here in
