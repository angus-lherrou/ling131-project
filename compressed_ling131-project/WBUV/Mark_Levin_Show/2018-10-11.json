Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican\nBut he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast and ... he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also an never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows and small cars\n\nIn the more the words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob I'm not going to allow our ... totally ... it is without a doubt that there's no other word is ...\nPut a stop what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her ... joined her she got her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking to the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these as mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests have nothing to do in the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Lewis what is that right yeah we did have that\nPoor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nTo do what we saw chasing right what about the\nPeople who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think it's ... yeah and if there are the party as we call it um out for sure come on let's they serious\nYeah so that's married after him jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual ripped bald and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another rejoined are the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville side of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that a real fast Richard\nLennie Lennie Lennie will pass the N. word because I feel like that as part of the weaponization of of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... he now says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's apparently right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\n[noise] and it's being weaponized in such a way that it is devastating Lee effective\nAgainst the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook will start a silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling a mob mob\nBecause it's correct\n... the curfew will be lifted for residents if they do want to start venturing out but the sheriff's department in Franklin County really has held off so far giving the green light for people to get out there simply because search and rescue teams are going to deploy ...

mob and that's\nThat is exactly what they become and he knows 'cause he's seen on ... and this angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign uh they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe\nThat you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they could intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their way into office by letting you know\nThat if they don't when you're going to see more violence in the streets you'll see more

we opposed his a confirmation process\nWe as a party did not endorse or in any way support the activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now in our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they this is their base they have decided that there is more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians\nThey got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets to get in they knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead of condemning the mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weaponized the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon and\nThat is being used we will weaponize\nThat word we will paint your party as the mob in the

Fox News hurricane Michael downgraded to a category one storm last Wednesday to eighty five miles per hour the storm came ashore this morning as a category four in the Florida Panhandle rather\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he said he said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment of fight\nTo the death\nAnd they would demand debate they would do manned the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ... deferential lax\nIt's called respect for our American government it's called a ... a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed so that it can function\nBut the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nUh let me read this or much of this editorial for you so you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation GOP majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell has felt cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year\nTo assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor of vote for nearly a year think about that you want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations ... Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have won\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do president\nTrump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand this\nBut Democrats care about the environment\nSo Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees that Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one Vassar and Germany and and once he got there\nBoy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists ... Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin they finally get rid of Grinnell as the ambassador\nAfter languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way it's because they didn't have as a master there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed closer this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to muck up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nThe going back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years ... wells\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he is now saying hey it's a nice midterm election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from D.

now downgraded to category one hurricane it's now over Georgia\nUh most of the time my rule of thumb was studies is if it doesn't make common sense\nI tend to not believe it [laughter] if it cuts against the grain of what if I see a study and I said well they can't be true that makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know when my life and everyone that I've ever talked to a informed me that that is a a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I disregard the study this one though\nI find fascinating and I think that it makes sense\nBut what I'd like you to tell me is why why do you think this is true\nMen actually favor female politicians\nOver Mayo politicians midterm elections are just around the corner and so it could be a potential turn the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study finds a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for it\nSuch a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males and survey fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers in the Steven's Institute of technology and I won't get bogged down in a lot of the uh various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part\nOf when it breaks it down between ah Republicans and Democrats\nOr this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way Republican men and women\nAre fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other she don't know me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same in in in terms of their their a resume their track record it's is it I'd have to flip a coin between two Republican candidates and one's a man and one woman\nI'd probably go for the check I I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I\nGot I think it makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women I'm just more impressed by them\nAnd I think they're used to take him to death a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better\nI think men are are are are are too easily touted by the media they oh they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a old don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way and the professional world being married\nFor decades raising kids raising grad and you think I'm going to be concerned about\nA Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given\nBirth\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere a Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminist than Alan Alda just wait ... you bet ya I think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes\nAre they they want to show women how incredibly wonderful they are looking hardly ... I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right causes he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal cause in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets to where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for a while then you'd get a free pass up to a certain point\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of ... and and where they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rallied tomorrow\nAnd uh that's they're opening line that's how they get their checks most of them married

that the nursing home was wrong and denying nothing or the job saying they had violated the part of the state's medical marijuana law that bars discrimination against those who use it\nThis is

do\nTo keep the mob from taking power\nBecause make no mistake\nThis is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with cars you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regained civility if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nBe a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing\nDown so what are you willing to do to stop\nThe mob from taking power eight seven seven three at one three at one one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark living on the market within show he will be discussing\nWhether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably mean a investigations impeachment of not just President Trump probably justice Kavanaugh\nOr if a mark living might be talking about the remarkable his door Rick victory of the Republican Party\nIn maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington DC and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we cattle are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend and over the past two weeks how they're going to govern\nThe Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years what are you willing to do to stop at\nAge seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well\nActually forgive me it started early in the morning yesterday in the Washington\nPost these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that the Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump\n... republic I was about ... Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican\nBut he has to be a Republican he used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the daily basis I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast and ... he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies that were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and happened over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mobs on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech in a little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows in small wars\n\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob a ... an hour oh I totally am it is without a doubt that there's no other we're now it's going to\nPut up with a non ... well we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a steward Varney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had a rich joined her she had her one rejoined or what we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nOr my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that they always report these has mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted at the end the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump\nIn the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right right I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that\nPoor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing right\nAbout the people who were at the Supreme Court\nTo a certain extent we don't know

in front of the Supreme Court one of them jumped up there and gave him a lap dance\nYou know because she's a woke feminist or something and uh and they are a mob and they don't even want us to call them a mob\nOr listen to the president again a real fast this was him at his rally on Saturday\nAnd max is doing an artist\nAnd you know an hour to an angry left wing mob and\nWhat that is exactly what they become and he knows 'cause he's seen on ... and this angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign\nUh they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe that you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they could intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their way into office by letting you know\nThat if they don't when you're going to see more violence in the streets you'll see more protests in the streets you'll see more disruption of our society Eric Holder who apparently wants to run for president he was the attorney general under Barack Obama here he was at a campaign event in Georgia\nMichele always ask

endorse or in any way support the activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now in our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they this is their base they have decided that there was more power\nAligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians\nThey got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets thinking that they knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead of condemning the mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weapon I think the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon than this will be used\nWe will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob in the streets until you step up and condemn the mob only then can we actually have a civil conversation in the meantime if you're a mob if you're endorsing the mob if you're supporting the mob\nThen we will warn the rest of this country that if they vote for your party they are empowering the mob\nSo election is twenty seven days away when mark live in gets behind this microphone for weeks from tonight\nWill he be talking about the
