does Tom\nHands off to Whitley who is hit shore the first down and dropped going to be one yard shorter there'll be\nThird and one was snowed under a plethora of panther defenders across the way built three or four Panthers down on the talk of only pick up a couple of is going to bring third enough about along to yours probably for down territory for the war [noise] Panthers\nMade a stop here third down into they say\nThe ball is that the twenty four yard line Pascagoula leading twenty nine and Thirteen opening drive the second half Wally hands up to Whitley and Whitley fighting for yards I'll tell you what the parents are deemed really knocked him back it'll depend on the spot they were all over it right there\nYeah if you if you go by the border line just came in to make this bill is going to be short of the first down by nearly a full yard good pursuit from the defensive secondaries from Pascagoula\nNot the least of which was number forty two for the Panthers Caleb Trent excuse me Christopher ... came in and made a big hit from the secondary position\nAnd the ... going forward on for down into with Panthers leading about sixty and they're trying to draw Google all gulag does not jump now it gets under center and takes it forward and he's going to have a first down and he stacked up at the twenty still fighting\nFor yards [noise] and I always want to see that play Tommy when it's obvious you're trying to call somebody all sides want not snapping when you feel like\nThat's all you're trying to do drama ... go ahead and snap and go straight ahead and that's what he did first down the ...\nYeah 'cause when when they don't jump all sides that tells you they they're leaning back just a little bit to avoid it so if you negotiate to contact with that quarterback snake especially on one yard or less needed first in\nSan warriors at the Nineteen Wally under center face the handoff rolling out right he's being said what he throws it and it is incomplete not a good path there and it could have easily been picked off there were more Panthers there than warriors\nYeah Ellie was that pursuit on a blessed from as a secondary nearly got to a wall and I don't know while it was just trying to throw the ball away or their pursuit forced the Arab passed but number thirty three four Pascagoula James giant Madison was the closest person to the football couldn't quite get to the interception but there was no chance of any war you're making that catch\nI'm Wondering if uh one of the warriors maybe the wrong way on a route 'cause they're really\n... you're near that ball I'm sure that will be settled at the house tonight because his brother was the tend to receive from\nSecond happening in for the warriors Wiley rolling out now I'm going to throw back to the

Thirteen first and goldie ...\nAnd it's a handout Whitley gets inside the file to the fore kind of a delayed hand off their Tommy and he was able to get about two it'll be second and go from the

[noise] now they've had a little chance to get to catch their breath come back out here and they need to put together deepest than Pascagoula need strength together a couple of first down Monticello\nKirkland shots in at the tail back and we did get work ... tore his ACL Tommy and the first happened\nProbably out for the season first than CNN [noise]\nPanthers Kirkland has the ball and he has running room he's at the thirty ... thirty five forty\nGreat block it to forty five he's down to forty thirty knocked out of bounds their montel Kirkland\nWould not go down and that's what he does when he has green space\nAnd what a great play from Kirkland as he takes it twenty five thirty five forty five forty six yards first down below and bill I Wish I made a recording before the game of another good job of down feel blocking about Charlie miles Kirkland set it up and miles set up the did the block as as well\nCareful not to hold and cardinal went by that block and picked up another thirty yards or so so again great job down feel blocking wide receiver hadn't had a ball thrown his way all night but he has been a very major factor in this game with his downhill blocking the one two punch of Corey Walker and Mattel of Kirkland I mean they're just awesome to watch\nPascagoula not thrown a pass in this game first intended to twenty nine and the handoff goes to liberate the substitute full back\nWho came in after the injury to Hauser and\nWhile fight on the field as one of the panther helmets came flying off from a warrior and a flag fly I don't know if it's all upsetting or what but\nIt takes it takes an effort to pull somebody's helmet off bill that's got to be an injection I saw the whole thing developing ... miles is the path of receiver will slung to the ground and his helmet a ripped off probably frustrating from the previous play when miles did a great job the outfield blocking that's got to at least be a personal ...\nOh my goodness oh they're calling it on both teams uh I don't know about that bill\nMiles as I said I don't play because his helmet game off where it came off the coast of the ... defensive back ripped it off as it\nYeah it takes some effort to get a helmet off goodness first down I'm Sorry second down after all that shakes out yet Pascagoula leading by three\nJust uh just to finish that thought bill excuse me that at the at at the end of the net result that was a a post whistle penalty flags and that's the reason the second down now when there was a flight from\nSecond down in our formation at the twenty nine yard line Kirkland got us down here and now black flies before this map\nAnd they're discussing something Sam's was in the ear of the referee and I'm not sure what the discussion is but he quickly blue is whistle to talk to the referee and the whole crew now in their\nBill was there a flag or was just a whistle blow to for a discussion\nThere was a whistle blower on for a discussion I saw uh the two of them talking so and I don't know what maybe they were talking about the clock whether the clock needs to be running or not and the clock is stopped salad already not now they wind up\nThat was actually a break for good luck\nBecause the ball [noise] yeah they place\nThey were out in the game part and reset the clock so Pascagoula still gets four twenty five second play clock to run down some more time\nMonticello Kirkland the tail back ... leads about three there at the twenty nine of the reveal\nPitch goes to Kirkland around the end he's in the thirties flag flies and he goes out of bounds there some smack talking going on between the two teams holding on July is the call\nAnd I'll Pascagoula needs that they all need to keep it together right here the leading by three and yeah that hold it and going to help\nThat a flag was in the backfield some two or three yards as well bill and as you know in high school level holding as a a spot fell so that's going to be a greater than its attend yard penalty but the march off is going to be\nMore than ten years from the loudest Graham is whether it's happening in the backfield\nSo it'll be ... down from the forty two they've got to get to the twenty so second down and twenty two\nFor ... and Corey Walker getting his helmet on but\nAre going to hold him off for another player's Kirkland is the tail back the ball gulag moving left or right and the ball is on the right hatch\nSecond and twenty two [noise]\nA formation\nMake get up throw it and he's tone it down feel an incomplete\nWas in the hands of torture saying any good to hang on if you watched Ole Miss Alabama\nIn twenty Fifteen it was the same type of play it bounced off the war you're into the hands of towards us at any couldn't hold onto it oh my goodness and that was six he was behind the defense and that's going to bring up a third and twenty ...\nPass it was the elected by the a warrior defensive secondaries sometimes you know when that when that tip comes it's almost like getting thrown a change of all boy I guarantee you talked to Georgia and after the game he'll be the first one to tell you that he probably should have come down with a ball\nAnd what a game changer that would have been what looked like it was going to be an interception that looked like it was going to be a touchdown for Pascagoula\nNeither of which came to fruition so those are the worst part about it as the clock stopped by forty five left and Google is going to have to call to come out\nOf the play waffles down to two bill they had to call that are facing the last game penalty so\nWhat a roller coaster of emotions and the last\nLeft in one minute of game clock [noise]\nOh my goodness I said Walker I don't know who that might have been Kirkland on their own it was ...\nAnd so the ... has first down at the one\nActually it's at the two yard line unbelievable\n\nFor thirty left in the game the ... breaks the huddle its first thing go for the warriors at\nThe two Wally\nTakes the snap goes forward\nFollowing his blockers is down at the one\nOh my goodness heartbreak city\nThey kick it to Pascagoula we can't find the handle at the two yard line one of the speeding credit the ... one of their speedy backs getting down to the field wreaking havoc in Pascagoula gives up the ball\nWell they also have the short feel to cover bell remember they were kicking off in the past ... forty five yard line so not near as long a run as a traditional kickoff\nForty three forty Panthers leave but the ... scores on the one yard touchdown by jade and Wally and just like that\nThe warriors lead for the first time in the game\nThat you took the words out of my mouth bill for the first time tonight Pascagoula trails that game that they have to feel like they've

I mean we were up ... were twenty five seconds left\nAnd somehow the ... credit the ... day battle back and I think they woke up in the second half where we were up twenty nine seven\nAnd a it's hard to to fall much in this game you know it's just a\nIt was it was a it was a typical\nGoing to win the game\nAnd that's what happened that is so cliche but in this in this case so fitting a bill for you to say that or whoever had the ball last\nThree you were joke you know the over Ninety seven or the other recovered the three three drive by the Advil or in the fourth quarter or less than a

Court justice before the weekend is over it's going to be fifty\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolks that sacrifice everything and there was something that happened here yesterday that Chris ... says this perfectly for the entire country now the sunset and I'll give you an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their a major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron dissent is for governor for years after endorsing Democrat\nRight\nLife from the story a major union for police officers the Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently has a Democrat but as a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor and and Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing and Wednesdays endorsement at the Santa is the PBA president said dissent is\nWould be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran did say that this has our\nBacks that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this\nPose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sun ... he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling not had any mothers that their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I notice what was going on\nNot long after the whole cap or next thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking\nViolence towards police officers remember before the whole capital Nick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops who were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South\nFlorida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise]\nWell I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance but here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had and and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and forget about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line duty afforded than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups\nBy media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all\nGood people put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better and worse we had this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't want to have good folks don't want to be police officers that put on the badge to leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nBut if we don't have great folks to pick up that badge to put it on the field that helped hold that fill that void the rest of the matter\nAnd that's the other way the left is systematically chewing through our society to support your police

share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just take those straight to the FBI place\nNow I'm right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have a receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are not going to get anywhere and that's the problem they most\nPeople and this is true conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives to but you've got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned\nThe Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing ...\nThe right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nExcept for that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political train that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable uh is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link that millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being legal to drink the youngest one's right oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them right along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right\nHere they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them and then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change that Obama probably made sense because hey that was one our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's
