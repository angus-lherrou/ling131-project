I'm not a I'm not a business or an expert I don't know why Kmart or\nWhat I had a shared [laughter] but I knew that I'd be in a different business right now is that they manage to or they manage to appeal to the consumer they make better decisions about what products to sell them seriously now who was responsible for why you have to be an expert by the way I'm not\nK-mart was better at this ... well fine that's what consumers wanted fine and they serve the consumer didn't win win Sears decided that it would approach or broached\nThe issue the arena of of discounting their sales went shot up but I ... I don't know anything about the details for all I Know Sears is a streamline that's going to go and be Kmart I don't have the slightest idea let the market decide\nAll right and then the other clip here that I got to run by Gregory now get your response after\nThis you know can can serious by k-mart to and you're in you're of course you think so\nSears has been one of the great protectors of the

discounting standpoint look at where we are now was so there's Amazon has a place here so what's at\nAnd are better at what Sears originally was which was a catalogue company that you order stuff from and then evolved to brick and mortar essentially\nYeah well we've got we have the turnout direct to consumer retailing mhm that was the catalog but now it's on line it's the same concept you order from the company that shows up at your door rather than you happened to go to a store and being visited upon their inventory in person\nBut you ride it it's sort of the Amazon effect but also um in
