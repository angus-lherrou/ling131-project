and keep it from New vein as aggressively towards the United states\nTruth is these caravans though are being driven by leftist organizations in Central America [noise]\nThey are in by human traffickers who do need to know have no regard for human life\nYou know we're the more information we're getting\nOn all of this the more information we have on this caravan more obvious it becomes that ah yeah that's right there are people beyond this there are people who are involved in organizing and funding and and pushing this whole thing forward oh literally and figuratively\nUm and it would have I been saying all along that there's this talking points\nAre there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're already seeing now is according to NBC News an hour ago oh that's right now that they've assembled and gotten all this attention they're not planning on walking the whole way\nThey've advanced two hundred and fifty miles into Mexico\nAnd you have them asking quote for buses\nWeary Margaret caravan rest in South Mexico asks for buses that's right you got about four thousand four thousand people saying that you know they want buses and organizers oh that's right it's not an organized event my friends but they're organizer somehow\nThey got organizers who are are trying to get all these buses to materialize and get this whole thing going and\nWe're supposed to believe that there's that this is just all spontaneous this just came together because there's no there's really nothing in it beyond that there's nothing to it beyond that\nUh is is just nuts it's just nuts and there's such nastiness\nOut there right now about Trump's sending more troops to the border again they're saying oh it's political theater it's political theater\nWell in the military is not going to engage in a military sense the military just as they would be used you know when we send National Guard or will when we have military that assist in a natural disaster zone\nNo one stupid enough to suit or what what they're going to do ... new houses that have been blown down with no\nObvious your militaries there to help to assist in whatever way they can because the interests of the nation and and it's people or the interest of the United states military\nAnd ... this is the commander in chief taking it upon himself to try and assist or border patrol and it's also a show of seriousness\nIt's also meant to say hey you know whatever we can do we will do and we want border patrol the feel like they have the full backing in support of the federal government which by the way of knowing that not happen to the Obama administration did not have one of the Bush administration\nThe Bush is are bad on the border\nYou heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say so but the bushes were bad on border issues I mean George W was\nHe was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy on on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know have the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on [noise]\nUm but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective\nMaking the right choices here to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between\nThe Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats don't want to they want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges\nOf those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able to contribute to the economy in a net positive what they don't want any of that\nThey want as many unskilled\nA limited education non English speaking workers as possible or even non workers but what's going on over there was maybe it was possible as quickly as possible because this is how the left as it gets crazier and crazier and more and more socialist\nThinks that they can turn America into a one party state\nA one party ... a democratic socialist state run by the Democratic party immigration is is central to that plan do not forget it\n[noise] there's a revolt that has been ruined for some time among conservatives because we understand that social media giants out there have they left word too and we're sick of it we don't want our conversations to be clipped to be steered in other directions or just to be entirely

Fox News President Trump holding the first in a series of rallies is less than a week to go until the mid term\nWhat they're pushing this challenge to produce and just remind us what happened ... ... why it's\nNot a I'm not a business exist or an expert I don't know why Kmart or\nWent ahead of stairs [laughter] but I knew that I'd be in a different business but I Know is that they manage to or they manage to appeal to the consumer they make better decisions about what products to sell them seriously now who was responsible for why you'd have to be an expert\nBut by the way I'm not k-mart was better at discounting than Sears well fine that's what consumers wanted fine and they serve the consumer didn't win win serious decided that it would approach or broach the issue of the arena of of discounting their sales went shot up or they profit status\nI don't know anything about the details for all I Know Sears is a streamline that's going to go and be Kmart I don't have the slightest idea let the market decide\nAll right and then the other clip here that I got to run by Gregory now get your response after\nThis you can can Sears by k-mart to and you're in you're of course you'd think so\nSears has been one of the great protectors of the consumer all over all during its existence as a matter of fact you say can Sears by k-mart the white Kmart has been growing the question is gonna be can Kmart vice [laughter]\nAll right but that's\nAn example not take that other words you you really didn't want the Justice Department out of this too huh I mean you don't have any problem at all with\nWith us as Americans affected anti trust measuring you could take in this country would be complete free trade\nAnd the Big East will eat up the ... little ones that is not we've already has the demise is made that has never happened there have been very careful studies May of what has happened to the concentration of industry in this country over the past hundred years\nAnd accept in those areas where government has stepped in it is not true that the Big East is eaten up the small he's in fact it's often been the other one and Kmart is a good example is started from nothing Sears was already a major conglomerates Sears has been losing losing ground and going downhill and Kmart has been rising\nWhat a cool little time capsule that is that the thought process of seniors in Nineteen eighty versus now\nVery interesting and it will say that they still have the catalog at that point yes they did happen each jak did it yet but man or things about the change in another ten to Fifteen Years\n\nFrom a discounting standpoint looked at where we are now so there's Amazon has for a place here so what's a ... and\nAre better at what Sears originally was which was a catalogue company that you order stuff from and then evolved to brick and mortar\nSexually yeah well we've ... we had the turnout direct to consumer retailing mhm that was the catalog but now it's on line it's the same concept you order from the company that shows up at your door rather than you happened to go to a store and being visited upon their inventory in person\nBut you ride it it's sort of the Amazon effect but also um in one of these discussions here you know how we say well Netflix did the evolving that blockbuster didn't want to do\nAnd someone pointed out while we're Netflix started they they weren't a streaming service they were just the CDs they've only been around for Twenty years but they already went through the huge evolution that all these other companies miss and it wasn't because they were their first as long as your biggest richest it's because they innovated were the other companies didn't and that was their only advantage Sears didn't innovate\nYeah actually they drew back and like fortified but didn't expand and innovate and ... and they were really in that first piece you play just kept talking about discounting those Amazon discount not\nReally I don't really they they put a price on it they felt that it's already discounted from that standpoint and I think ultimately you see this thing of coupons and sells big friday sale the big wins the the
