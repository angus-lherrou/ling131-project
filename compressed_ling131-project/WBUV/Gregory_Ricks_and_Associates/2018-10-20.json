on every play an every call it was interesting to say the least I'm sure Alex can agree with me Alex in the studio a and Pascagoula came out flat the coaches said they came out flat the coaches took responsibility for them coming out flat but\nIt's hard to blame them after the game with the our bill fifty two fifty and you lose that game on the last play the game when it looked like Google had it and since that night we have figured out that was the uh\nBest rushing game for a team\nIn the history of parents are football four hundred and sixty arts at one night\nIn twenty eight teams with

B. U. V. moss point in my heart to radio station\n[noise]\nWelcome back to ... football the Panthers\nAnd the Indians battling once again on\nThe football field these two teams go back a long way Tommy of course they shared the same district for years [noise] see if we can find the first ever\nGame [noise] but she knows that um\nThis is always an interesting battle these two teams have a story to history state championships amongst them both in fact I think one game we were over in the luxury they were celebrating their fortieth anniversary\nOf one of their state championships and I talked to bill Snyder you know he works for W. although actually it's been a sports guys been a\nPerk um sports information director knows a lot about Gulf Coast sports and he was just it was talking about Biloxi and how they have fallen over the years and the talent just doesn't seem to be there and he said this year is no different they're kind of struggling again and I and it's similar to Pascagoula honestly\nYeah both teams are coming in struggling a little bit build but this is a storied rivalry I mentioned uh the comments from a bill Snyder and he should know as as well as anybody or anybody that follows goes to a football the both of these teams have a story histories but a falling out a little bit of hard times this year but\nTeams are probably looking at this game thinking this is what we can win and what our snap on on the season\nTo go up and give them some very early over there you have a new mold does have a son who's coming up [noise] fourth down in seven in Biloxi will have to have their second part of the night a booming kid that's the one you let go and he does\nIt takes a huge amounts and it rolls out of bounds instead of going into the end zone it goes out at the time [noise]\nSo it's a field position game right\nFor the two teams\nThat we've seen nearly four and a half minutes of a game clock roll off bill a three possessions so far not a whole lot going for either side except for the past that her parents penalty against past the gate Biloxi\nSome pretty decent Phil position which now has resulted in turning the field physician battle past people are going to start it their all what is it nine your line in between the nine in the yard line\nSeven thirty seven left in the first quarter Biloxi nothing Pascagoula nothing panther starting their own non\nMoving right to left balls on the left hash Monticello Kirkland gets to pitch and has a good hole to get through and he does he gets out to about the sixteen that will be a pickup up seven on first down and that's all Pascagoula wants to do in the game last week Tommy Pascagoula trail Twenty one nothing\nOr might have been twenty eight nothing it was Twenty one nothing\nAnd we had a ten minute drive not exist wires one millimeter at a time and the but the Panthers did score on the job and there was a hand off the Kirkland and cook Sims is fine with that that's what they want to do they want to run the clock run the ball you know just like his Nineteen thirty five\nYeah that that's fine when you're a case right now scoreless but it certainly hurts basketball and situations where you you got to get a couple\nQuick strikes we haven't been able to break some big plays in the Russian situation throughout the game but you can't really rely on that all the time to pick up a woman last play at least thirty two\nAnd I'm not saying Nineteen thirty five like that's bad if it works it works and it has worked as many games this year for girl and it did work on that particular job I was talking about ... off the Kirkland that would have worked exhibit flag comes in\nAnd it's going to be illegal procedure on ... market back five yards and those are the plays when you have a running theme like like we do it's hard to overcome and the other thing Sims says is when you're down Twenty one nothing in the game it's hard to overcome Pascagoula had two good opening jobs\nIn that game against ocean springs came up empty on both\nAnd it really set the tone for the rest of the night\nAnd that's the thing when you have those types of often or that type of office I should say if you are going on the time consuming drive where you go all the way down the field you got to get point you can't go that far and then not get points in this case right here\nHave a third to appears as though that opening was there for a first down the death penalty back some a\nThird in seven ... gonna throw it he gets away from one man now he's going to run it he's at sixteen and knocked out of bounds they're so Pascagoula will have forth into and probably gonna have to punt again\nYet to penalties in this game so far build boats have gone against Pascagoula and and both of have a significant plot in this game so far one facet affairs a moment ago turning to fill position battle that one or two plays go Pascagoula jumped all sides early on a third into gave him thirty seven and they came up short on the third downplay\nSocial fans calmer and for his second attempt hopefully gets better ... this is Tom and has time to punt the ball [noise]\nAnd there is a point and it's a good kick butt it kicks it right to the receiver had to kick that a little more to the right away from it and it might have rolled twenty yards but he did catch it at the forty three yard line in Biloxi winning the field position game right now and that's really all we were at\nI think that pass interference is the only thing that really flip the field and of course the great point from Biloxi knocking it out at the man yard line so it will eventually James pay off your point be able to express that starts at the\nThirty six seconds started at their own forty one now here they are third possession already starting inside Pascagoula territory at the path of forty three yard line first and ten Indians\nFive forty five left in the first quarter no store Indians break the huddle\n\nPierson has Kraus to his left hand off goes to Kraus trying to find a running room and there is no room in the end\nPanthers everywhere on that play great pursuit by Brent lead toward dissent among others Jared Johnson that's a great play from Jerry Johnson he landed up on the right side and and came over and made that play on the left\nSide of the defense ruthless aggression from the right defense in a position of a of a bill that you gotta be careful fast it was a he has to stay home just in case lucky picks up on that that may be a mess direction in their future\nSecond and eleven they send a man in motion and he will they will fight to hand off to him and ... and we'll keep putting himself he gets inside the forty to the thirty eight that's a good pick up\nFor them on second eleven it will now be third and final pick up of six it is at the thirty eight yard line\nIt looks very young team there a bill person only a sophomore five ten a hundred and eighty pounds and he must he must have had his pads only got on the scale he's slightest that are out there I don't know that one eighty is true or not but a very a green looking athlete but only a sophomore\nAnd Kraus the junior running back he is not in the backfield empty backfield said he's at a wing position and they send a man in motion and does your brown and there's a time out on the field we will take a break as well Biloxi nothing Pascagoula nothing that's his parents are football all news talk one oh four and on FM\nPartnering rank and real estate is round to sponsor the path\nTo Los Angeles and

B. UV\n[noise]\nWelcome back to pass the goal of luxury Pascagoula a and the tide at zero\nFor twenty four left to go\nIn warm blood coming out of the time I'll say third and six here against the founder defense\nAnd I'm back thank you very much Pearson and the shotgun they send them an emotion and brown effects it going to run it again and he's got a wide open lane he's at the twenty fifth inning chant tackle that the seven [noise] goodness gracious [noise] big hole there I think they saw something\nWhen they ran that play a minute ago maybe they corrected\nAnd he should have taken that to the house really but good play by the panther D backs yeah they were first and goal Biloxi at the seven\nOf them no bill is like Moses walking ritzy part I almost got on the end zone Pascagoula lucky to get to tackle after seven your last and make them are in those last seven years with a big hole in the middle of good play from blocks\nUnder four minutes to go in the first they send Brown in motion again run in the near side has now this time and it throws the whole time off that play Pascagoula read that from the get go\nAnd that's kind of an odd play time because they send a man in motion and then he gets the snap and he's fake to hand off to him now three plays in a row you figure he'd give it to him one of those\nYes equate a running a mob receiver rather brown coming in motion and as you mentioned is the third time they've shown that showing that flavor not yet have they give it to him they will run it eventually will they'll hand it off the ground but so far it's only been a fate with a quarterback keeper\nThey lose too on that play so second goal from the eight a good play by the parents are defense reading that out\nAnd the bad snap as what happened and there was another bad snap but they he face it and it's going to run it into the end zone he faked the entire team out any Pearson yesterday in period you write Pearson ran it in\nAnd just like that the Indians are up six nothing\nThe fake handle bill if you'll notice period than used to run right so whether the receiver who's coming in motion from right to left or left or right after\nThe fake handle Pearson goes behind the right side of his office of line that particular than the receiver went from left right and motion and after the fake handle fears and dumped them behind him and the receiver actually turned into a lead lock\nIf I'm reading this right Pascagoula just sitting in a freshman Andrew shank of which five eight hundred and\nFifty five pounds maybe he's going to help out over there on the left side of the defense the hand off this time does go through Kraus and he hit hard and dropped immediately good play by the Panthers [noise]\nTrance like Louis maybe\nYeah right in the middle of the uh the offensive line for a Pascagoula read that one particular play did Boeing [noise]\nSo second or third third third down sorry third in five\nTwins left one receive a ride a big play for the panther defense they got a whole variety here [noise]\nThird down\nPiers sitting in the shot yarn sends a man in motion to the ... the far side fakes it and runs it Jared Johnson hit seem but knock seem forward as he hid scene and the rest of the parents are also knocking forward as they tackling so he goes down at the sixteen which is short of the first down\nAnd they will send in the kicker for to attempt to feel gold forty\nFourth in to their bill I thought a blessing might think about going forward there but they as you mentioned do have the feel go unit on the on the field for about eight thirty to yard a temp which would make an aide\nTo score game there you go that's the answer to score right Cade guinea a senior\nIn for they feel gold kick hold\nDown kick is up plenty of leg and the kick is no good he must have pushed that\nPlenty of leg mocked goodness lots of going Florida State wide right I don't know if you've seen I don't know which network it is it has the feel go tracker now\nThat they can tell you how far would have been good from while on any ... well that one would have been from plenty [laughter] except he didn't hit at Seventy ... that's a key factor you got to get in the middle it's a one in the middle\n[noise] so the Panthers Dodger little twenty two pistol bullet there and they break the huddle\nComing out trailing seven nothing [noise] first intense from their own twenty trailing seven nothing\nAnd they have a loan back it looks like the loan back is\nBarred well and barred will runs right and\nHe goes down at about the twenty six yard line so just to one back set there with the full back yeah interesting\nCall there are effective for a pass to go with the slight make I don't under center right they're building turned into this shortage as you mentioned to the loan back the full back over the rise up picked up about six so very effective play of course now for the Panthers are down to about eight minutes left to go in the first half\nWas barred will number thirty eight for Pascagoula chemist barred well he's a senior\nAnd montel Kirkland the junior is the tail back in Kirkland gets at this time and has running room and was dragged down once again by the Jersey but he's right at the first down a marker it will depend on the spot and had that Indian not grabbed his Jersey could have run for a while\nYet barely got the nose of the football to the thirty or line bill and that's all he had to get to because as you know the ... was unsuccessful but the ball did travel into the end zone so Pascagoula started on their own twenty yard line just as if it were touched by on a kick also those who football touching the thirty that's enough to move the change of first down\nThat is a first down and that's all I Need is to touch the line of the thirty the pitch goes to Monticello Kirkland run in the near side breaks one tackle flag is down as he's thrown down out of bounds\nBut I think it might have got to benefit of a call their bill or getting a flag\nAssuming as a face mask against the luxury [noise]\n\nIt's a incidental things mask on Biloxi which means he did not pull it when he grabbed it [noise]\nAnd key that that's going to be a added on to the play is as well so uh well replay that down it would be first and two for the Panthers\nHalf the thirty eight yard line seven Fifteen clock is running biloxi's seven Pascagoula nothing in the second\nQuarter all set on this Tom Kirkland the tail back\nHe gets the handoff bounces it out to the outside of the first down in more and he gets to midfielder to run out of bounds their flag there it may be another face mask Tommy\nAnd certainly came in an area where it could be a threat to the point of contact men at our backs to as much as nobody over there to hold so I don't see how it can be anything else honestly [noise] yeah there was the running back in the ... come through there how often do you see that back\nIncidental face mask [noise] just when you think you've seen it all [laughter] exactly [noise] oh my goodness ill real quick\nShout out to the Pascagoula wrecked department had the uh all the youth league football teams out here it's a night lining the field for the Panthers to run out on a senior and I I notice a big thrill for those young kids to be down on the big field on friday night watching the Panthers come out\nFirst down in the end for Pascagoula pitch\nGoes to Kirkland and he falls down and has hit as he falls let's give a shout out as well to the eighth grade Panthers who won last night forty one to nothing she learned Cornell Tommy\nThe next panther star I'll just say it now and everyone that IRS man knows that knows what I'm Talking about left handed quarterback\nFor the eighth grade team also one of the top twenty five USA Baseball players had a phenomenal game on both sides of the ball last night and that team is happening and I think there's one more around which means they would play for the championship next week\nAnd there's a hand off to Kirkland who\nIs thrown down near the first down a marker thrown forward thank you very much Mr Indian\nYeah grab the attacker grabbed him through um\nForty actually landed on the black Sea Tac weren't built another couple of yours for the first album back to the eighth grade team bill those are some are kids are starting to come through not that\nAre by no stretch of the imagination my trying to take any credit for it but those kids that I coached youth football or a few years ago and\nThat that group has potential to be special luggage kids coming up through those attacks in the future looks bright for Panthers on friday night\nSo it is first down in Tim from the thirty five hand off to Kirkland has no room is Tom just trying to run through forests of trees there and there's no openings second down and ate\nIs one of those ... like you describe a moment ago the opening Dr against those are springs and a third second half last week and now the strap against a Biloxi here very time consuming Pascagoula methodically going down the field has been the benefactor of a couple of five\nFace masks but it's got to get some points on the board after holding the balls is long\nIf you're an impatient person that drive past week drove you absolutely insane and there's a hand off to Kirkland left side\nAnd close to the first down and it will be thirty down in about two for Pascagoula\nClock winding down and out of five minutes now or\nIn Pascagoula will get the ball versus the second half so you know Pascagoula cut yourself a love nothing more to go down and milk was clock down inside of men\nAnd a Pashtun score in for\nPotential equalizer it would be sweet if the Panthers could get this went in and they're happy with this clock\nJust running third in three big play offset a hand off the Kirkland left side and he hit right at the first down a marker bouncers outside however chapters legs going forward and he has a panther first down\nHe took a big hit from a much bigger player right there for a Biloxi but it was just that it was a hit it was not attack them they sort of almost just walk like you might see the newer version of a high five ran into each other\nAnd both cardinal able to bounce off of it keeps us balance and fall forward and nearly one out of bounds but did not get to the twenty nine year old line first in Pascagoula [noise]\nPanther you break the huddle four minutes left in the half\nNow and they are tight set on the left side\nOn the left\nTasha I should say and the pitch goes to Kirkland who go straight ahead bouncing off Indian has a first down in more fighting for yards gets down to the eleven\nThat's the Kirkland we love right they're refusing to go down\nIn my opinion Kirkland is a much better it back when he doesn't try to do this cat movie just hit the whole not a big back by any stretch of the imagination one six months but he runs hard and he's got he's got to hit the whole and continue to run\nTime out on the field Biloxi seven Pascagoula nothing but the Panthers knocking on the door will be back with more football on news talk one oh foreign on
