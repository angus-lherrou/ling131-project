really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up and energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winner for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and these different players who obviously were kneeling are but the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand showed there because Trump understands that at the end of the day a vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown slack more so than that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that\nHe understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas\nHe knows that the left is going to jump in all my gosh she's being a racist white Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there\nUh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really liked the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King a

favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's a the cartoons that are making for kids these days but he knows when he calls Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised they jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just\nNormal people who are not emotionally destabilized left is what we hear is\nWhy are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called the ... you know she's not a Native American right we all understand this so why do they act like this to some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Polk honest is probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nBought the era coordination and how was that matriarchal society and how they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who there's some really interesting revision isn't out there about\nA native peoples in America and how both technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing\nIt is tough to claim I think that the European columnist were shaking much of their political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the war in thing are we calling her Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on the show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they're taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked and ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a very\nPowerful tool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like Samuel Clemens AKA Mark Twain why we know the names

I Would wait during good health I Would white neither have turned on Social Security she's her\nBenefit all her records obviously going to be more than half of his so he's not going to draw that he's sixty four so he's not that far yet so he just needs to\nKind of really look at the U.S when he retires is the first point the second is when he reaches up for re\nAnd then you kind of looking is it's a year to year\nDiscussion so he's in two years he could turn it on basically at at foray\nAnd draw what a no negative to him working is not going to have a income test\nOn that but for both of them differing does create a larger benefit for them to draw that you know that permanent pension that you can build larger guess he didn't say when he's planning to retire\nI actually said can't retire until sixty six\nOkay but that's not what is that is the worst that's the first decision point\nHis wife's not going to be eligible for a for a yet because she's going to be ... ... sixty to do that\nIn that case if he is going to retire it how to assets correlate to that decision as well so once get were partially getting there but then you have to ask that question if he's gonna retire what is that income going to be based upon\nAnd will the need for security to make it work maybe the assets can handle it but what's the long term effect on the assets they\nWe keep developing more question things we need to think about\nWell here here's this next hypothetical what if he turns it on and six at sixty six but continues to work\nYet there's no income test he\nHe can make as much as he wants to a Social Security is going to be taxed it's just if you're continuing to work and you're not needing that money what's the benefit of turning it on its being tax it isn't like you're saving\nThe whole check it's going to be taxed so I Would think more in line as long as you are working you defer that\nIf you work beyond Seventy you're going to turn it on an age Seventy the big worry would be turning working in turning it on and then all of a sudden you've increased your lifestyle because you're making more money then you've got to when you do retire you're having to really dial that back\nI get the impression you've seen that quite a few times yes ... weekly [laughter] weekly that OK scenarios yeah yeah\nAll these questions I asked the things I think about when we're having a discussion yeah it's all about\nWhen people turn it on keep working increased their lifestyle and then rub gets pulled\nOut the typical question is we were thinking about retiring wanted to see your thoughts get your thoughts see where we're at\nAnd behind that when they see what the ... ... do we have enough money ... is this going to work that's kind of the underlying questions they might not come out and say that but that's what they're saying are we going to have enough money one of the bomb shell questions is\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries that the left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThis state enforcing the same outcome is for all people right there were some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes of people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you you have whatever the state Danes to leave you um but I suppose I'm getting\nToo deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to time loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\nI'm Ben crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listen to the show ...\nMany of you solve that very very early on I've not just come around to it now I I consider myself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way\nOf doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you know you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nAh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time that CNN sits down the ... of course do your own on one pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I Know her name\nI just don't like to say that because of increased its ... the uh not Christine it's ... and she told a friend of mine owns a but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out\nHe doesn't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense but on the issue of Bill Clinton sexual harassment because we're in this meat to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect
