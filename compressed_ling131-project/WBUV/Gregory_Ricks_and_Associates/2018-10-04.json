{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "So we can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United states\nOn friday I ordered the temporary location of US government personnel from our consul general in boxer [noise]\nI also warn the Iranian government that will hold it directly responsible for any harm to Americans for our diplomatic facilities whether perpetrated by Iranian forces or by associated proxies for elements of those malicious these latest destabilizing acts in Iraq or attempts by the way they were gym to push back on\nEfforts to constrain it's malign behavior clearly they see our comprehensive pressure campaign is serious and succeeding and we must be prepared for them to continue attempts to hit back especially after a full sanctions are imposed reimposed on the fourth of November\nSo let me tell you what's going on here there was a rocket attack\nAgainst the U.S consulate in the southern Iraqi city of Basra now ... is in Shia Shiite Iraq if you will is down in the south very important for oil you got a lot a lot of oil to get that flows through there to port city\nAnd there were rocket attacks on the U.S consulate there this this is the Iranians trying to clap back if you will the United states after we pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and uh put sanctions back in place this has been a concern for a long time the Iranians control militias are inside of Iraq\nThe Iranians are able to escalate violence in Iraq whenever they want and they see this now is a way of\nJust look they haven't gone all out of the violence that that could happen in Iraq the sectarian violence is is pretty terrifying really it's it's horrifying what what could go on there this has been a concern all along and it might devolve back into a state of\nEssentially civil war like it was back in two thousand six two thousand seven between Sunni and Shia in Iraq and you got the U.S caught in the middle in some ways we've got diplomatic personnel there obviously military military trainers still there\nBut the the Iranians are trying to show us that they can still cause problems\nFor the Trump Administration and ... who is acting as a diplomat here not a military man is saying look it's not a not not a good move not a good plan for the Iranians to do this week we expect them to engage in this kind of behavior that doesn't obviously you mean that we're going to be okay with it though\nThe Iranians think that they can use paramilitaries and their proxy forces in places like Iraq to go after us to turn up the heat on our interests of that because they actually can't win this game of well we're just going to allow the economy to keep getting getting pummeled while we hope that the international\nCommunity comes to our side we hope that Trump you know the Iranians are hoping that Trump doesn't stay as president you know that they've got all these different ways that they can try to rationalize\nWhat's going on there at the end of the day the Trump Administration has taken a much tougher hand with Iran the Iran deal is Trump said when he was running for the presidency was a terrible deal badly negotiated wasn't something that anybody should have been proud over should have signed on to you and we're out and now the Iranians are starting to try to find ways to\nYou know just just a Ronald Ronald sort a little bit you know foreign some rockets that are constantly there's not an open declaration of war they're going to say it's through its on of course running soldiers Irani it's Iran backed militias but they take their orders from Iran and the I. R. G. CD Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps so\nIt's really just a a fig leaf but this isn't the Iranians firing rockets at our at one of our diplomatic facilities so keep an eye on this one error things could get ugly or ... in Iraq and the Iranians I think are starting to get\nA little bit desperate\nWhen I tell you about global verification network folks they are the only dual certified veteran own background investigation and vetting company they are federally certified as a veteran own small business and independently certified by the national\nVeteran business development council they're the only minority spent certification recognized by the billion dollar round table what this means is that they're the real deal veteran owned and operated you can trust them they know what they're doing and when you need an answer about a background check or some vetting they're the people you want to be asking\nThey have risk mitigation experts across the country there are headquartered in Chicago with offices across the nation however large or small your business maybe call global verification network and make them your background investigator\nGo to my GV N. dot com again that's my GV N. dot com or call eight seven seven six nine five eleven Seventy nine that's eight of one one Seventy nine global verification network leave no stone unturned [noise]\n[noise] It's Wednesday October third fourth fifth day on the free our radio a\nWas the best ... gas station in one at least a rock top fifty ... got a dog and the radio original vision vital experience\n\nShot at one thousand dollars out\nOf the nation wide Andrea Andrea weekdays from five AM to be a thousand dollars every hour no\nOne thousand dollars in\nTax the key word luck two hundred two hundred you'll get a tax confirming injury plus I hard radio in the\nState or data and misery to buy that look to two hundred two hundred views talk going on for nine ... from the men do Buick GMC studios [noise] this is talk for nine point and I urge radio station [noise]\nShot in the line of duty ... Fox News five officers in Florence County South Carolina gunned down boxes Rapaport has more lie\nYou have just put up a wall a cast of wall in a moat\nAround your industry and supposedly I haven't\nThe the specific numbers here but supposedly some of those walls have been broken down a little bit because the number that was thrown around it was like two hundred Ninety three hundred percent\nTariffs on imported cheese products into Canada and that counted from the United states like I did ... aren't we buddies we have good cheese you don't like our cheese no there cheese lobby just didn't want to compete with ours and so they can basically charge whatever they want\nOr really what what usually happens in these situations where you get some sort of favorable tariff\nIs Canada will raise the price on imported cheese three hundred percent and so the local cheese manufacturers will raise their ...\nI says about two hundred and eighty percent you know they'll they'll still get the the race will just undercut everybody else\nSo as new details come in about that will be passing them alone\nBut I guess so far so good\nYou know there there's a lot of people who are critical of NAFTA and if this is significantly different than after then it's it's just a PR when because it's kind of hard to write a headline against this because again people just don't get emotional about things like that there's no real visceral attachment to that topic\n[noise] I said we're going to get to something significance happening and Social Security I don't know if it's because people are listening to the show I doubt that that much of an influence but people are retiring and taking their benefits later and this is later\nYou got to take a long time CEO for this one because it's been pretty even ah in the last few years but in Nineteen Ninety seven fifty seven percent of men claiming their retirement retirement benefits under Social Security we're sixty two\nAnd we fall out of our chair when we find out more than half these days it ... it was even worse Twenty years ago more people were turning it on the first year they were eligible taking the biggest hair cut\nThat Social Security ... it's it's literally the least amount of money you can get from Social Security on a monthly basis turning it on at sixty two\nFifty seven percent of men doing that so by twenty Seventeen\nThat share had dropped to thirty four percent\nThirty four percent because people were elected they they wanted to claim later they want her to get more money some of them did the math some of them uh I I guess fewer people are able to retire otherwise it's June if you're going to keep working and you're going to make above income limit and then there's the claw back on Social Security it's just not worth it\nSo that's actually a good trend something that I like to see because uh thirty four percent of of men and twenty Seventeen turn their benefit on at sixty two well that means sixty six percent didn't and they're doing better I mean that fifty seven percent turn it on immediately just horrible\nSo the average age of a new mail beneficiary if you want to look at it from that statistic has risen by just about\nA full year in the last Twenty years\nSo that's some interesting stuff uh in\nNineteen Ninety thirty eight percent of Americans ... age sixty two to sixty four were working by twenty Seventeen that share had risen to fifty three percent\nSo that kind of strengthens the side of the coin that there's many different reasons but one of them was hey if you're still going to be working in that middle ground between turning it on early and your full retirement age it just makes less than less since\nWell part of this ah also lets me know that you know wages have gone up so there's not like there's less incentive to work in those ages I just think we're more healthy\nSo it's not that big of a it's not ... not really that old sixty two to sixty four someone dies when they're sixty four year like what what happened to him they died a little early and when Social Security was founded that was that was the life expectancy that was about the average man so indicted sixty four he'd be disappointed you like ... tragic what happened was at a car wreck\nSo good news I I Would like to think um some of that push was for people listening to us but you know math\nIs only fought so hard and what does this mean [noise]\nThis trend continues and people were going to be getting more out of their Social Security and if they raise that full retirement age a little bit that's going to give another incentive for it to be pushed up\nAnd it looks like things are getting a little better as far as that goes [noise] do you have a financial situation not quite
