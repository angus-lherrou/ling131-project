sexually\nHere in the next year or which at the end of June\nTesla had about total to point two billion in cash on hand so the first one that suck coming due in November's two hundred and thirty million it has a ... five hundred and sixty dollar and sixty four sick conversion price amateurs and November well\nAlong with his fines for um whatever you poke the bear you know the SEC ignore sword that he can absorb this probably too but the the next one is nine hundred and twenty million matures in March and it is three hundred and fifty nine dollar in eighty seven\nSet conversion price that's going to be a little bit more of a problem and they're probably gonna\nRaise some more money through bonds it'll be convertible because they don't really want to collateralized\nThe company because if things go bad\nYeah bondholders like taking assets in that way so I just kind of threw throw that out there\nAnd look here's my shopping experience going back to ... we talked about you know\nThe and

they print out these bonus points and such if you come back this month and ... and you get thirty three dollars towards it I don't know what the minimum is you're going to buy it didn't really say and go to the website was kind of\nIt was going to take more than a couple of minutes to figure it out so I moved on so I went in there yesterday and bought a couple of things but I showed them I was thinking I said well how do I take advantage of these thirty three thousand points which a thousand points gets you a dollar\nSo he said well let's look it up well I hadn't even been credited my points you know the white September is a couple of weeks ago now\nSo I I should have already been credit so it got me to thinking so when I\nArrived back home I said I've got to look into what's going on with this points and another thought came to know what if you want me to the previous time by some warranty on something and of course I said no\nSo what happens if you do have a warrant to see what happens at warranty if the company goes on there to bankrupt was to go on bankruptcy is kind of the ... thing so it depends you know and also those pension holders they're the largest\nCreditor it just was undisclosed the amount by the federal pension court but they're listed as the number one creditor on the list of creditors so but hey if I've got a warrant the I feel I'm a creditor thing breaks yo you said you're going to take care of it\nYeah and that so what happens is in bankruptcy and probably why they haven't been credited why would they credit them if they're going to make them all go away all these points they have out there\nI'm going to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told that my grandmother worst part Cherokee enemy Indian it and they all being just talk but

leadership bad later\nSo I\nI like everything when Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he he was he didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I I he just misspoke a you know he didn't mean that he\nJust met or Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians up and many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nAh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole ... running chair anyway\nI Love the other stuff he was saying about I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey\nGraham is he's very much a very much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger\nThat I think that he really understands uh he he really understands that you got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean ... kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to the show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they are willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them when we got to crush the ideas I don't crush people I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as a kid say we might have to own the lips a little bit\nUh so what does your grandma I liked that he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also think that you know on immigration and he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more a hard line on this stuff ... here's what he said liquidate\nTheir eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning the poor countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to merit based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together build a wall control who gets the job\nMore legal immigration moved a merit based immigration you can't ignore the eleven men they'll never be a deal right where the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think you get to it on this when you have folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little is a little too squishy on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University ... nerds for back me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least I I don't know what we have to", "show_name": "Gregory Ricks and Associates", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "16"}
