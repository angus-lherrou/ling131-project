Fox News floor together to Rick Scott gives an update on the damage from hurricane Michael factors team Rapaport has\nAre expecting the downturn so bad that when they get the first sign that the the frenzy happened until people catch their cool they look at the earnings reports they look at the balance sheets of these companies behind the stocks they look at what's projected for the earnings report as earning season for the third quarter starts now\nAnd they get back in so what if this is just a temporary downturn where\nUm who's in corruption territory I think the I think than aspects already and correction territory and the S. and P. or down not far behind if we have another couple of days like we've had the last two days yeah there'll be encouraging territory\nBut what if this is another correction like we had at the end of January beginning of February this year in retrospect\nIt's a it's easy to say this now but I understand why if you were in a if you were looking at the market in February and you're like I got to get out of this thing turns out you bought at the bottom and whenever you had to buy back in you ended up buying low in selling high because it it went up almost immediately after the initial crash\nSo what does that mean what does that mean February is in retrospect is a buying opportunity if you've been waiting to get in on on Amazon to like dude I'm not paying two thousand two hundred dollars a share what good it's like Fifteen hundred dollars a share right now\nTo the investors who are keeping a long term view the sort of the Warren Buffett not necessarily\nBy on hold forever strategy but the long ball you're playing the long game\nYou're going to look back and on the charts it's going to be pretty easy to\nSee that this was a buying opportunity that if it stops that if it stops going down I Do not have a crystal ball and I'm not going to sit here and tell you to more of the things are going to turn around immediately not get back worse\nThan they are today that I mean even if there is a nice little jumped tomorrow could be a dead cat bounce we still have another ten percent to shut off these markets we may still have another twenty percent to shut off these markets\nBut before I get to the ... will do that in the next segment let me tell you why pessimistic\nAbout this market and I I I feel a little bit of sympathy toward the doomsday or as you say this is just the beginning of a cataclysmic economic collapse that has been long overdue and it's only been delayed by some spurious actions from the Federal Reserve bank\nLet me start with number one is the debt debt that's hanging over all of our head and it's it's there's the federal debt\nThere's the federal deficit there's the unfunded liabilities that are hanging all over our head but that that word it it it's it's a drag on so many sectors of our economy think about that the debt we have at the state level for all these pensions and for all of these entitlements there when we have it at the city the municipal level the county level\nThink of all the pension funds New Orleans firefighter pensions that whole mess they got going on Chicago I don't think there's a pension and New Jersey that's allowed to stay above water and that's a joke but there's there's so much debt everywhere\nAnd and that's more than just a normal day we've had you know we've been running credit card debt backup since the recovery began student loan debt is now at an all time high\nAnd what does that mean all that means is we paid or we got something yesterday that we're going to pay for and the days in the future and it it's not voluntary it's not like well I'm going to the ... decided to not pay that\nNo you're you're going to pay for it one way or another you're either going to default or you're going to pay and both of those are going to have negative consequences and so when we have that on almost every aspect of our economy this debt load these bills from yesterday we're going to have to pay him today and we have the the you know if that's\nA a wind pushing us there's also sort of this vacuum thing pulling it down as well and that is what's coming off the Federal Reserve balance sheet that called quantitative tightening\nBut all these assets that the Federal Reserve bought up because no one else in the market wanted them and they didn't want their little buddies over on Wall street the collapse you know they ... and whatever they've got to start shutting all these things off their balance sheet which is a de facto\nA ... no I'm saying that Ron I'm deflation of currency is supposed to be taking more\nA liquidity out of the currency pool [noise]\nWell you do and that's the same time you're raising rates that's another big one so you got raising rates you got quantitative tightening you have this debt load and we have the bills coming due from all this stuff that we put on the credit card in years past [noise] and I can see that there's a great argument to make on both sides of the table but we'll focus on the doom Sayers neck [noise] we've got David Stockman we get Dan Schaffer\nThere's this individual has awesome

I think it was on the Varney showed he was talking to Charles pain I Know they mess up their schedule this week so here Stockman ... a great question how do you compare the economic approach a of Trump to the guy you worked for Ronald Reagan\nYou work with Ronald Reagan his view of the markets versus this president's mark\nA totally different okay ah he didn't confused himself with the Dow Jones average Reagan understood what capitalism was about and that was happening because people out there in America we're getting bullish they were believing he was turning around the economy\nThat earnings prospects are getting better than his tax credit made a difference today Donald Trump is a massive egomaniac\nWho thinks a you know the stock market is a a referendum on his brilliant leadership when it's going up and it's somebody else's fault when it's going down\nHe is a dangerous man he's dangerous on trade his Jane dangerous on this deficit\nAnd the last thing we ought to be doing is attacking the fed when they're finally getting enough gumption to get interest rates to some kind of normal level and to shrink their balance sheet and get their big fat thumb out of the stock market and the bond market and let capitalism do his job\nI get the impression David Stockman is not a Trump fans you sort of gleaned that you know sort of read between the lines you know the big fat idiot part where he go maniac what'd you say uh\nThe the thing that I like to do it in a situation like this though is sort of separate them you know the stock market and the economy\nOr not the same thing and look if you have quantitative tightening if you have all these assets coming off the balance sheet other fed being thrown into the market and if you have the interest rates going up the federal funds rate\nAre being raised by the fed at the same time\nOf course that's going to have a negative effect on the stock market or should have a negative effect the downward pressure\nAt least but is that a bad thing no no all your undoing all you're doing is you're on doing the artificial high that it created the stock market when you lowered it and the first place when you bought and put those uh those assets on the Fed's balance sheet and the first place yeah it's a negative thing but only to the stock market\nIt's not affecting the rest of us out here still we're still going to have look they can keep unwinding if they want\nAnd it may wreck Wall Street but over here in main street we have three point seven percent unemployment\nWe have wage growth going up with inflation that's under control I I'm not one of those believers a little bit of ... is a good thing and I would love to have that argument on a different ...\nBut I think the rest of us are are pretty happy with what we see out here you know I just saw the federal register of you know the number of pages of regulations at the federal level for businesses go from eighty thousand pages at the beginning of last year down to sixty something thousand already like you've taken off\nOf a almost a third of regulations off the books\nOh that's amazing and it doesn't matter what's going on with the balance sheet at the fed that's still that are low it has been lightened for sure you guys are just destroying our monetary policy in the meantime but\nLife as it stands in in the economy it's not necessarily bad to see that stock market go down if it should be going down if it's going down for the right reasons and if it's going down because you're you're taking back some of the sugar high that it's had for the last ten years\nI mean I I don't want to celebrate the stock market going down but that's not necessarily a bad thing Peter Schiff\nHe is one of these CEOs ... hedge fund going what's the over now Europe Pacific capital I Believe\nAnd he's been a permit there for about eight years since about twenty ten he's been calling collapses around the corner collapses around the corner collapses around the corner\nWell he is asked to respond here to the fed 'em to Trump's saying the fed has gone crazy which was a quote from earlier today is well\nPaid our President Trump called it a correction blamed the fed is it a correction or their market and shouldn't be blaming the fat\nWell all bear market start off as corrections I think this one is probably a better market is long overdue but you know Donald Trump said that the fed has gone crazy\nHe's wrong they didn't just go crazy they've been crazy for a long time it was crazy to lower interest rates down to zero it was even crazier to leave them there for as long as they did\nThe only sane thing they've done is to raise them back up but what is crazy as for the fed to believe that they could raise interest rates without breaking their own bubble which is exactly what they've done this is a bigger level and the one that blew up in two thousand and eight\nAnd the crisis that is going to ensue is going to be far larger\nYou know you mentioned earlier in the show that hey in the past people were able to pay higher interest rates that was true because we didn't have all this debt face the fed and cheap money we have more debt than ever before individuals corporations the government is loaded up with dad and his interest rates go up that that is on serviceable\n\nThat you're hiring replacing ...
