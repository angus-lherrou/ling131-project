{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "A cry it continued downward trajectory on crime but is that\nReality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know there's just like showing up in in the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like those already happening in the crime\nWas already happening the only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative a lot of them did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAt ACLU types of all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about doing stop and frisk in Chicago\nNobody had any ideas for how to make Chicago a less\nCrime ridden place I mean it does the number of shootings people think of ... and I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because\nWhen you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed or you know more than that in some way to get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it in the low it's an elope thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbed in a given year\nThat's a lot of people that are getting shot\nNo one has any illusions are any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nOh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school would come out in this isn't serious\nBut they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that you know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single German or whether it a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father are both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across all\nAh all all cultures and all ethnic background so you can't have the structural conversation about why this balance the place of Chicago you can't talk about more aggressive\nPolicing issue that's racist and at the end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do gooder is near protecting civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton\nHe's running around and demagogue ing well this sharp and that's what it does struggling\nRuns around and and demagogues and things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away you know liberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and sharp and to just say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in you know a numbers ... numbers based policing a cops that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violent situation on the controller Bob [noise] McGough hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise]

I'm not going to do that I suggest you do before somebody else does so not doing it\nAs a riskier option out there now go back to the Equifax hack back in twenty Seventeen mhm they captured a lot of people's that promotion\nGuests to Social Security uses for verification of your identity your credit records aqua funny yeah\nMean somebody out there might have your information to go set up your Social Security ... wonder if they really wanting to do it when you turned sixty seven once you've got beyond that far east so they grabbed the lump sum check and run off and maybe get a few months check before you figure it out before you get\nNotified in that case now if you did freeze your credit files to protect you need to an freeze them so that you can set up your account then you could go back and freeze them you're going to need that\nPIN number\nOnce the account is set up you can access the latest Social Security statement on demand\n\nAnd you can start looking at your earnings Mary ... another reason for doing this is you know the Medicare cards are being updated and you're getting a Medicare number\nInstead of your Social Security number so if you've not received that yet when you go and sign up for your Social Security or kale you're going to be given that Medicare\nPenn\nI guess that's just third reason if you're of Medicare age to go ahead and set that up and I'd just challenge you to go do that before somebody else does the passwords are good you have to change them\nAnd not going to agree to how you're not\nCashing checks through Social Security or their\n... you know it it's\nPeople it's safe and this is a day and age you need to get used to doing this stuff and using complicated passwords and such a system to keep up with them or keep them in a safe place if your brain can't hold them all\nBut get this done well the security protocols have been updated when I set this up about a year and a half ago [noise]\nUm I went back and I checked in on a couple of times just for purposes of the show and I didn't used to have to put in the code that they would send to your phone\nBut now every time you're going to I I log into this they send me a toad with my phone is a two factor authentication every time now used to just be when I changed my password and also had to do it again or to reset my password\nBut now I have to do it every single time so that they\nGive government credit we beat them up a lot but they responded to some security issues they've upped their security games I don't know if it's theater or it just makes me feel better but that at least they're making an attempt here\nSo for example if they're sending it to your phone you're the only one going to get the Penn mhm which is a no other layer that's really good so if you're the only one that receives a pin somebody if somebody's hacking you they have to have your phone\nTo do that right or somehow had backdoor access to your tax but it yeah one of those quick tax where you don't even have to a knock you out and it's on the front screens eight did yeah\nI and that's the reason for you to do it first instead of them goes and they've got control of all that\nYeah and and just as an aside something I'm thinking about doing is a member of the synthetic identity issue we had where people were getting Social Security numbers from children\nAnd building credit histories on

just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy food is being now following hurricane being now brought in a way of\nUnbelievable large amounts of water and food and everything that\nPeople can live on the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part\nThey're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity has already back on this in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration is\nShowing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting side of this and the first priority at first thought of every body is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life for them to have been two lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nA but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see their political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron descent as his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they\nCalled them a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect\nYou remember running attack at the ... in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads specifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and I would ever hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed and in this case the uh the candidates running these ads\nEven while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to either batten down the ... or ... or or wait until they can return to their homes by what of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's there is such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these border races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the the Senate race\n'em and they're going to try to extrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race in twenty twenty you know the idea here being a Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policy but as your posing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know ... if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category for hurricane\nTo take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is and uh I I Do believe Scott's gonna pull it out but it's going guys going to make is going to make a close very close oh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you\nUm and I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd had the time to read it and we can really dig into it together I Want to talk
