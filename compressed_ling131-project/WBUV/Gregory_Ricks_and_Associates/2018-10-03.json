now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a ...\nSo what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw rose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interested power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the yet because what he's doing is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been swine\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you

he's going to be able to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nOr what does the process here of getting an

will be built again there'll be something else done another model and it'll have major changes from this one but also I'm sure it has to do\nWith\nHow many cars they've got a crash now do you want to be crashing any of those sorts limited production to probably fit into the rules of that they don't have to go record bunch cars to prove that they're safe and ... oh you're\n... reasons for that limited production as well and I don't know all those numbers but I Know that has something to do with\nI'm sure you're right because when it starts at four hundred and Ninety nine there's probably some regulation that kicks in at five hundred where it has to either meet a CAFE standards like you said they have to wreck like two thousand of them or something\nWith a bunch of dummies in him to get to get the results out but you know part of that mentality the the restriction of the supply reminds me of when you were telling me what ... does with all the stuff that it doesn't sell when the

fact the classic coke but\nIt's a it's reforming itself on a daily basis pretty cool stuff it reminds me of artist like Michael ... here in New Orleans I bet you that guy was painting all day every

you think we think the wages are here national\nUh average wage fifty two thousand six hundred sixty four\nUh it sounds pretty good\nThat's that's for full time workers but I'm a lot of this\nIs they're attributing\nA little boost in there for minimum wage hikes across twenty states that help the lower people\nAre not pull down the average so much but that's only that's only a fraction of it most of this is actual organic economic growth a lack of a available workers in the employment pool or in the unemployment pool and companies being forced to shell out more money to keep their talents or buy new contract\nYes the talent you saw the effect\nOf it on Amazon they announced a minimum wage increase\nAcross the board for all their warehouse workers they have a few warehouses big ones\nHay and I I Love that stuff that people think I'm anti minimum wage I'm only anti minimum wage if it's the government telling you to do it if a company wants to decide that it has a for for wages of course that's okay and if they had done the math and they can make more money paying even their bottom barrel workers more\nSounds like a good deal to me who the heck would be against
