B. UV\nWelcome back to the panther football what an exciting game a thirty nine and a\nThe Arctic from ... big down to the have yard\nLine and then slate and make takes it in on the quarterback sneak in the Panthers leaf sixteen the seven\nAnd man what a cash I guarantee you when you have a bill comes back out on the field they're going to have number seven Wally back behind center\nOr even if he's not behind center is they're going to get the ball in his hands more often than they have so far\nHe's leading the team and Russian yards who's leading the team in passing yards and he has a few receiving yard as well and there's a little boots kick that we did earlier it bounces at the forty this time the automobile catches it\nI Love that kicked out we haven't seen that version of the ... comedy but that's the second time it's happened and I think that's what he tried last week if those if you all the\nTuned in last week we all saw something we'd never seen before the kicker for Pascagoula actually kicked it straight up in the area on it on the opening kick off this one goes down the field and bounces we were recovered that the first time we did it almost got that one but the Advil retained possession after forty one\nYeah not sure if the ... was looking for another uh some same sort of kick bill but that was actually cause lousy the quarterback who came down with that football\nBecause the lines up as the tide in now\nAnd jade and Wally is in at\nQuarterback and he's going to keep trying to get around the right in and he does he's at the forty five fifty boys quick he picks up a quick nine yards and right they're just trying to get some ... open space and he's trying to talk smack over there\nThat run out of bounds ride it right near the midfield stripe so a good pick up on a first down of about eight maybe a close to non yard so like I said he he is a lot of a quarterback now but even if it costs Laskey miles up a quarterback a guarantee is going to be looking to get the ball into while his hands\nSo they break the huddle suck it down in about two sixty seven the score\nLeads ...\nHands off up the middle and he has a first down inside the forty five down to the forty two yard line [noise]\nSo number eighty eight for a Pascagoula met the runner in the whole this Fisher guy\nSix won two hundred and thirty pounds senior almost strip the football but not quite a pound for pound the turf after that plane knew you had a shot at the football but didn't quite come up with the first time the orders was gained down through the past ... forty two yard line the ... on the move\nThat was Whitley on a carry forward ... warriors Google leading sixteen seven with non forty left in the hat and the handoff right side is to justice Davis and Davis and doesn't get far there\nJared Johnson number nine pitching in from the offensive and position with a nice place\n[noise]\nThan Davis trots back off to let Whitley come back on the field and\nWally calling the signals now jade and Wally the junior\nIs under center\nWith mark he's Whitley behind him five eight hundred and Seventy found\nSenior and he throws a pass this time and it is caught but great tackle about Jackie Madison\nThat was really read junior on the on the cats but he only got three yards on that a great play from Madison\nBell I'll tell you are to cornerback sandbags and Addison probably go up and down in the Gulf Coast and not find another team\nWas the diminutive size excellent her back well guaranteeing six say across the state of Mississippi you're not going to find them but I but nobody comes up and makes the open field solo tackle better than they used to I'll take them against anybody when it comes to open field tackles\nI I'm with you we lose big but Acheson has another year here for the Panthers there is a a snap to Wally he keeps it himself almost to the first down to two yards short\nSo that'll be if it's going to be a fourth down here Tommy fourth down into from the thirty four yard line I'm\nGoing to say the bills off and it stays on the field here fourth and to from the thirty or for your line in the yard line to make is thirty two your line that long for a for a a field goal not a whole lot to gain all the parts of the our bills off as a will stay on the field [noise]\nFourth down into and they're in the shot gun two yards back\nIs Wally and he takes it and writes that it looked like there were two men in motion no flag and he hit hard and that was your Corey Walker only hit Tommy from the safety position I think he stopped short a bus stopped short Corey Walker with levels\nThis kid's a football player [noise] I mean he just came out I was a choice Paula Marlowe missiles shot and he is down in ... takes over first Janet ... thirty\nFive yeah they're ... they're did appear to be a a at worst a timing issue in the back bill for ... through the play off a little bit bill and a lot like he was going to make it at first but then the big move as you mentioned from Walker coming up from the\nDefense of secondary but the ... stopped him a good your short Pascagoula takes over on down a yeah I thought there were two men in motion\nRegardless the Panthers hold Walker stays in the game at running back carry house or the ... a full back and make under center", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gregory Ricks and
