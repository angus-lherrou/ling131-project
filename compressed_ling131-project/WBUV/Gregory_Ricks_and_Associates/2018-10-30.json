now ... macro sense our concept of operations is the flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas and then Arizona and then California\nAnother thing he's done to address this the second prong is two bills but they both do the same thing it's sort of like a it's called the patient right to know act one of them deals with pharmacies one of them deals with Medicare Medicaid and in government\nInsurance and what happens is if these drug companies give a pharmacy a sweetheart deal on their medication they they are putting gag orders and saying your pharmacist now that we're giving you this discount can't offer other cheaper alternatives well that's illegal now\nAre there was to build it took care of that they've already been signed a past sign and they're about to be an actress\nSoon enough so that's already done this week he announced a third prom and that is on this drug prices initiatives doing something about the disparity in costs between what the drug sales for here in in foreign countries\nWere taking aim at the global free loading\nThat forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country and I've seen that for years and I never understood same company same box same pill\nMade in the exact same location and you'll go to some countries and it would be twenty percent the cost of what we pay and in some cases much less than that and I'd say why is this I never knew that I Would be able to stand here before you and have a chance to fix it and that's what we're doing we're fixing it\nYeah well I'm I'm a little worried about this because if they do this wrong this did screw things up the other two problems on the approach I wholeheartedly applaud I just need to see more details but how this out of you Gregory is that really a big deal of difference in cost between what we pay here and in another country a\nLot of variables and that between what's here and uh and another country or that the rules are different on quality of what you get elsewhere and that's even when it's manufactured overseas so it's not quite that simple\nRight and and I I agree there's so many different variables that there is that the question is okay I I Would like to see the disparity come be closed a little bit\nBut the big question is how are you going to do it if you're going to do it by deregulating the pharmacy industry here and are lowering barriers to get things to market and making the prices go down in America that way that's cool but if you're going to make a law that forces companies to charge the same thing here that they charge and the third world country\nWell that's not going to work out good for us what I'm saying is that makes sense it at\nA ... and all I can say is it's very complicated you would want to speed up process uh there's variables between generic\nAnd the ones that have the patents that are going to expire which allows the generics you know and you just can't rush drugs that you said well we need to get it to market faster okay you know I've got a brother in law that is a physician\nAnd he works and ERs and\nFor one of his rules as he does not like to prescribe new drugs why\nHas not [noise] excuse me I've been in the market enough what he does all of us all sudden someone nominally shows up or it\nAffects people negatively and he does not want to be a part of prescribing that\nYou know in one sense I'll make a horrible comparison but you know a might be the new fall that new windows that new car or all the bugs out of it yeah all the bugs out of the drug\nDid they get it wrong comparison right yeah so that's that's kind of the thinking there so you can't necessarily rush that in out there\nBut also on the other hand if you have something really promising and tests\nI think we're a little inflexible own allowing those that have run out of options to stop the disease so would that set we have to be careful but we're also a bit and flexible for those that need that\nOnly find more details will pass them along to you on the show\nAnd I will know a little bit more about what we're facing here but this could be good it

callers from Saturday show let's review that one or lend us from Covington hey Linda how can we help you\nGotta trust trust is for ... and it kind of federal\nMoney from the trust that person can make money they\nYou're keeping a special needs trust is actually now let's be clear where you're ... you're like the second legal question kind of\nCalling in I'm not an attorney and that's one way or the total wealth authority and we have a member of that west watchers attorney so we ultimately are going to different have conversation with him to clarify anything but the purpose of\nHaving a special needs trust is really keeping the money out of the individuals may you're at the core why would you use the trust because like on a ... trust a\nDisconnect it keeps that money assets at arm's length it's not in your name is ... sometimes it's used for a lawsuit protection I don't own any site gets all and the trust and what you want to set it up for his so what's in premature bowl or in the case where\nA disabled child or adult may be getting financial help\nAnd if they were to have money or inherit money probably going to disrupt\nBecause at least in the short term because\nThey're probably getting money in the short term it looks like a lot but for the rest of their lives it's probably not making the debt\nAnd the overall and as far as I can clearly answered can access I Would think it's difficult because it's not the Charles money it's and the trust that that money can be used to help make up for the shortfalls that help lend\nOut money without it\nRequiring without it we have to do it in their life\nI don't think you're ... if you've got a properly ... structured special needs trust were not shifting the money to that child's\nNot keep nor are they getting access to it because that would disrupt the government funding that they're receiving and that's the purpose of that is to help provide for them but not to disrupt the other resources they have coming so I don't know see how there's a ... capture a that\nUnless something was structured incorrectly\nIf they get a thousand a month and then medicate health insurance and things of that nature [noise] and then they die I'd years later and there was a hundred thousand or less than the trust that fishery in their child to get a hundred thousand\nI don't know because he never put it in the child's name those funds were never going directly to the child the child was going to inherit them or ever have access to them\nAnd it was never going to be cashed out and pushed to them that's why you're setting that up I don't see how there's a recourse long as you're doing a free thing within the guidelines we're not going to short the government such 'cause sometimes comes in where people\nAre wanting to get shifted the Medicaid and hide their assets for the government for long term care facilities and you can't do that\nBecause there's a five year look back that's why you would use a legal counsel that understands how all those rules work to make sure you're not violating\nAnything are breaking any rules that causes a recourse so to answer your question I don't see how that would be a recourse if that's done\nCorrectly but I Do not do that structuring but we have\nLots of clients that have special needs trust and we have more and more it seems that those are shifting our way we just had asked us transfer us\nFor that reason another maybe it wasn't but and it came from a much larger from I guess it was a big enough for them but you know what will take care of that family and look out for them but we deal with this on a regular basis\nThank you for the call Linda that the cover everything pretty much\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly I got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience daily say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pipe for writing this bio climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite racist things up as a demagogue condos and if I'm ... stokes up national I said this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person\nAnd what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics they're not trying to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement\nThey're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail why would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really a\n... you know state paid for health care and they paid for college which means you ... question of how much and who and then let\nThe may ... of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing and make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election\nOr they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans in there so terrible on the show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that they're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people who are going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically an editor already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys saw Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on\nWhat they said no matter what no matter what right um because you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election and a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not on that side of the most important election of our lifetime that is not true okay that'd be ... and it's not what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election it'll probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty sixteen\nSo twenty twenty will probably the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or that the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this mid term shakes out and that's why I just get so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe mansion effect\nHow is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes to unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans
