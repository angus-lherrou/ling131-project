here we go a share some Netflix ... points for per se that an afternoon trade today putting the stock [noise]\nOn track to suffer the biggest one day drop since July of twenty sixteen and they fall into a second bear market into march the stock the stock has shed Seventeen percent since October\nSeventeenth and we know last time earnings was they kind of like\nEverything went well on that so I ... at the time I don't know why it's selling off but it you know being tack has been hit over this past few days\nIt is being\nAffected a great deal by that the cars as for some recent news on the company or the company has issued two billion worse of ten and a half year junk bonds this week meaning yeah they're kind of paying high interest rate\nBecause of why do they have to get junk bonds yeah that I\nI don't have information on to explain why they're considered higher risk just could be their overall\nDebt that they're holding let's see the ah\nYeah with the U.S dollar portion paying six point three Seventy five percent or more than double the ten year treasury note rapists pocket closed on August seventeenth that three hundred and sixteen dollars Seventy eight cents\nA share or twenty four percent below it's July nights record close of four hundred and Eighteen dollars many market watchers to find a ... as a decline of twenty percent or more\nThe stock then kicked off new bull market when it closed on September twenty seventh and three hundred and eighty dollars and Seventy one cents or twenty point two percent of above\nThe August seventeenth low road a little further on October first before turning lower the stock\nHowever how gloomy\nThat seems it's still up fifty seven percent this year so what is ... if you look up volatility probably\nAs a Netflix description there because that's what is this show and it is volatile so you've got to have some tolerance there but when you're up that much or if you've held or the year to\nYou know you're up significantly and to have this volatility and it is still up fifty seven percent year to date so that is some crazy movement\nYes I Would open the year at a hundred and Ninety six bucks and then more than doubled that to get to that for Eighteen number yeah killing that\nI'm\n... its earnings beat revenue increase clients increase global what they're doing globally is working so um I still think long term outlook is up from here\nAs well as my thinking on that then this this show remember is once again is far\nEducational information in\nEntertainment purposes this is ... stock discussion as a recommendation to buy or sell and\nI personally on Netflix as well but ... does not mean you should go and buy it\nYou know 'cause I I I Believe there's a number of things that have to be made and a decision\nTo make a by and us having a discussion of it isn't there Boeing stocks surged ads over a hundred points to the Dow this morning and pre market trade so they beat Alexi an stock rises we had Freeport beat as well as that of the rivalry to it and yeah\nFor for my rent and let's see who else do we have and we were talking about so that's kind of some of the run down we had general dynamic\nA tops

light pole\nSo okay\nI mean a bruise your Mike right I Want to bring you it is it as an impartial observers here you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but there's nothing to do crazy there right now that's a good conversation that is exactly it's the guys it's very conversation\nAnd then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said\nThe Democratic party is\nComprised of racist white liberal that is correct and I write this why well let's go back um and let's say I will say that that many people in the party to are not aware of what's called ... part of this conversation ways that are you concerned about the color and the White House um why why would you ask that question\nThey has you speak about Blackfish as well but I Want to why why we get to that that's why did you ask that question today because they had I had and about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole group of young African American leader so I said this is something that I talk about often at that in many ways like liberals don't realize that you put on that\nThe races have an economy that ... guy had had the best that you place it only had how they got a question about race okay yeah I had a conversation about ... at least shapes fall\nAnd I was flying that we're shifting away everywhere I don't agree with that if you don't look at

thought this was the other two I think we're all gonna supposed to like you know\nBlock slap each other and I'm not even ... there there's more there I'm like okay because the control room because it kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to go to Greg and I'm like okay I got a brokerage was like no knocked on I was like\nDamn okay here we go so uh yeah it was a it was spicy spicy one day we'll get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man\nMy could we do that absolutely right yeah the bosses would never be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new drug bomb it like being left living\nA real quiet on assuming tell them not yeah no no he's for your do your your feisty and I know the Irish are ... you go on one one thousand Native American but I'm half are good at it takes about ...
