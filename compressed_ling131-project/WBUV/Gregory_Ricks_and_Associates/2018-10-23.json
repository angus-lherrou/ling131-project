stronger almost\nBut on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very\nUnreliable GOP senators we don't actually have a real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage in\nTrump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not effective messengers\nOn health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when

tax you gets taxed again going to them because you gifted so you give them a million dollars\nWell that's kind of high for one year gifts there's more tax being paid on that so create an entity and those people that you're willing to help being a part of the distribution\nAnd if you're all the fame yeah it's all going to you but you should have proper structuring\nFor that and look you're going to\nAsk for help on things over the years and one thing is I set aside money to help ... help fund\nAnd then the rest of the fun and once you take care of those other people that's all a God it's all tied up to take care of me and my family the rest of my life\nWhere you just don't keep this people coming at you and I and you can set up a a board for your foundation can be some family members as such to decide who and how you help\nGoing forward to take some of that also because ... you're going to be a barrage I Know you'd like to keep it a secret it just may not go that way you should try but that's one of the reasons for the foundation but you're coming a lot of money you know make sure you do some good with it\nAnd so then we're being taxed on that lowers the tax as well that you're paying overall\nOn that money so that's kind of where I Know long explanation of where you come up with how much is being taxed so then you've got say six hundred million\nLeft on it but that's going starting with winning who of a bright that's all yeah yeah it's low won in a quiet or do we go again and say okay if you win the one point six\nBillion that's still pretty hefty\nAnd then I think they said the cash amounts about nine hundred million mhm you're looking at probably netting about five hundred million there see if you're letting other you're getting the work that there'll be a good weekend but yeah that's a good that's a good week of going and buying the tickets you know\nIt took me a good Fifteen minutes to wait in line to buy those two because it paid off finally yeah pays off\nWell up over the years well yeah I might have spent a couple of days waiting to think about the guy and a year\nThings about the guy that decides he wants to do the foundation give away like half of it to charity but he does it not in the year he wins it but the next year so you he goes and pays all the taxes on it now that doesn't get really the the right off that he could have gotten I mean it would carry forward wouldn't\nA write off like that the next year so yeah you got to have all this stuff planned out and playing out immediately and if you win this late in the year you have a couple of months before he could screw it up\nNow my understanding of how it works you can take the ticket forward and get it comes from that you're the winner\nAnd then say I'm not ready to pick it up\nAnd release of information when you because I understand you can keep all that confidential until time to cash ticket\nIf you're worried about what if I lose it you know I Need a Big Ten thousand pounds safe to keep the ticket in ... you know that's a lot of money in there that little piece of paper's worth so one of make sure you followed the right structuring there but you should probably have a\nState slash structuring attorney to help create the right entities to do that you probably need a CPA on board the team to start with and you probably need a financial advisor on board with

don't know put a ... by\nBy severe every now and if you don't want to clear water [noise]\nSo yeah what perception we've been taught we're going to move on here in a few minutes but just talked about that a couple of things is you need to do some structuring some tax planning ... uh [noise]\nAnd I I think you should do some charity wise that should be a trust your mad money account maybe that should be a trust your poor Shearer keeping for your family should be a trust him and part of this is too\nIf something happens to you how are you going to want this handled\nAs well going forward and\nYou're probably not going to have enough time to think about all the ways so you might not started out as an era ... trust remember your that's been in the news some over the past few years from now you're very wealthy will wanting to make changes it's\nDifficult in that case so so does need to be thought through but you also need to think of your device is the winner at some point in time\nYou know might be from the helicopter James was telling you you're going to use going to your yard that sold across the ocean to meet you there when you went by jet\n[noise]\nSo unique structuring like that and and you could have the income pays out that goes to something else you know if if you your net four hundred million a year money out of it after the\nThe foundation the mad money taking care of family friends and so forth and then years that's still what sixteen million a year so what you're going to do with that where are you going to live you probably need security\nAs well but if you're not keeping this secret\nOh well I'm going to move well wherever you moved to they're going to know who you are\n... suggested what'd you suggest you had a good one I don't know if there's been worked as you say you can't on the front okay but you could later change your name\nYeah I was thinking if you if you win the mega millions tomorrow run down to the courthouse change your name except the price and then go back to the courthouse and change your name back to whatever your before but that would that be public record can you do that secret\nWould they know to go check it against that I I don't know I don't know I mean I think I'm kind of lucky that I have a generic enough name that if I just keep up the facade that I live in the same house I live in and drive the same truck no one will ever know the difference maybe that's\nYeah so this comes with some great difficulties and you've got to plan but also\nDon't go in a way that you acquire too much that then you become subservient to at\nWells and you should treat it like a business and hired as a proper people to help you handle those things that you're not good at and to monitor\nOthers um to\nEscape giving it away and then the part you're keeping for you and your family you\nBuild a safety margin and that's like saying well I can get by on that four percent sixteen million a year well then you probably should\nThat's taxable money so you're not getting by on that so let's say you're getting by we'll call it let's split it now as long as I'm gonna get how you're living all nine million a year\nAnd you probably ought to say well\nI can get by on eight million a year leave yourself a safety marching in there as well just like half the assets if you're going to invest in some correlated risk only half should be invested their the other half should not be correlated any type of risk because let's say you eventually do go through it\nAnd other people help part you from it and whatever but they're not going to get to this other two hundred that's going to stream out and never be at risk and control that so that has some thoughts on that but\nTake your time get the right help and this is whether you're winning one point six billion lottery or you when the ten million lottery or you're in a wealthy family and you're inheriting ten million dollars\nOr\nYour parents move on and they left the million dollar are already ... these rules that I'm Talking about are proportionate to that\nWhere you you do some good you got to pay some taxes you'd still make the foundation the charitable foundation depending on the size of the money and their beliefs\nWe have been told so many times that America First because of the history of that term is not something that anybody could say even though it really does convey a mentality in the current political landscape\nThat many of us are drawn to which is that we wanted government that puts the interests of America and the American people before the interests of not American people\nThat doesn't mean we're going to be involved in rapacious colonialism and emerge capitalism and doing all the natural resources of the developing world and all this other stuff you always hear from the radical left no no\nIt just means that if we are citizens and we are of this country or not all you're listening but you know most of our citizens but if if we're going to talk about what should be doing the government that represents oh should represent us ahead of the interest of other people\nThere you go\nVery straightforward proposition very powerful one very important\nFor but also as you no doubt realize nationalism has become something of the same way that America First\nHas been marred with a negative connotation\nUm but the Trump doesn't shy away from this and here's here's the usual separation\nOr you have people think of patriotism roughly speaking as love of one's country and people will say that nationalism is hatred of those not from one country that that that tends to be a way that people set this up right so if you're a nationalist\nDares dish you don't like those outside your nation and if you're a patriot you just focus on the love of the nation but of course if you think about this realistically\nThere's going to be gray areas and crossover between these concepts I mean if you're if you are truly a patriot you are going to put the interest of your own country head of other countries so is this going to be those those elements of a nationalist outlook\nAnd if you are a nationalist woman think it's because your patriotic and you love your country\nSo these are terms that evolve over time and that the the usage of them changes and I think the Trump is singlehandedly trying to the same way that now people say America First not oh Charles Lindbergh and how could you say that you don't know if he was an old for Trump's America First is different from that has nothing to do with that\nPolitical party in that political parties history it's something else it's the expression it the expression of people today that want to see that or that their interests are provided for first by their own government\nOr with nationalism there may also be a similar changing of the charm and the connotation rotted because the Trump I mean he he can do this he can say things and do things that other people cannot\nLargely because I think he doesn't care what they say about it and he knows that the people who want to understand him do and the people who insist on misunderstanding and will no matter\nWhat which then brings me to some of the oh my gosh did you hear what it looks like\nA Don Lemon CNN all the way she inaccuracy of pundit ... this year and I have an answer that question of course he's a pundit posing as an anchor but I just think it's funny that they say it was so it's almost always tap or so is Cooper just different levels of how\nDevoted to the Democratic
