I don't know anything about the details for all I Know Sears is a streamline that's going to go and be Kmart I don't have the slightest idea let the market decide\nAll right and then the other clip here that I got a run by Gregory now your response after\nThis you can can serious by k-mart to and you're in you're of course you think so\nSears has been one of the great protectors of the consumer all over all during its existence as a matter of fact you say can Sears by k-mart the white Kmart has been growing the question is going to ...

was already a major conglomerates and Sears has been losing losing ground in going downhill in St Martin has been rising\nWhat a cool little time capsule that is that the thought process of seniors in Nineteen eighty versus now\nVery interesting and it will say that they still have the catalog at that point yes they did have you checked it yet but man or things about the change in another ten to Fifteen Years\n\nFrom a discounting standpoint look at where we are now we're so there's Amazon has ... ... what set it\nAnd are better at what Sears originally was which was a catalogue company that you order stuff from and then evolved to brick and mortar essentially\nYeah well we've got we have the turnout direct to consumer retailing mhm that was the catalog but now it's on line it's the same concept you order from the company that shows up at your door rather than you happened to go to a store and being visited upon their inventory in person\nBut you're right it it's sort of the Amazon effect but also um in one of these discussions here you know how we say well Netflix did the evolving that blockbuster didn't want to do\nAnd someone pointed out while we're Netflix started they they weren't a streaming service they were just the CDs they've only been around for Twenty years but they already went through the huge evolution that all these other companies miss and it wasn't because they were their first as long as your biggest the richest is because they innovated or the other companies didn't and that was their only advantage Sears didn't innovate\nYeah actually they drew back and like fortified but didn't expand and innovate and ... and they were really in that first piece you play just kept talking about discounting does Amazon discount\nNot really I'm really they they put a price on it they felt that it's already discounted\nFrom that standpoint and I think ultimately you see this thing of coupons and sells big friday sale the big wins the the discounting catches

financial talk radio we'll see where we get every might come back to that topic you're in a moment by on the brake also we were talking about Tesla\nSo it has some issues coming forward you know just like who's buying it well then you know they're probably going to have to borrow more money and probably going to do it in the form of convertible bonds I've got one point one five billion coming due essentially\nHere in the next year or which at the end of June Tesla had about total to point two billion in cash on hand\nSo the first one that sucked coming due in November two hundred and thirty million it has a ... five hundred and sixty dollar and sixty four sick version price\nAmateurs and November well\nAlong with his fines for um whatever you poke the bear you know the SEC ... sword that he can absorb this probably too but the the next one is nine hundred and twenty million matures in March in it as three hundred and fifty nine dollar in eighty seven\nSet conversion price that's going to be a little bit more of a problem and they're probably gonna raise some more money through bonds it'll be convertible because they don't really want a collateral off\nThe company because if things go\nBad yeah bondholders like taking assets in that way so I just kinda threw throw that out there\nAnd look here's my shopping experience going back to ... we talked about you know\nThe and probably they're going to lose another hundred and forty store so the problem with whatever it is a chairman Lambert thanks they're going to be after bankruptcy and you know and I'll mention this toys are us went into bankruptcy thinking they would come out of it\nAnd they haven't yet but it looks like their debt holders are going to take the company out of bankruptcy and see what they do with this is kinda yeah good luck with that but hey if it's a way you can get your money go make it back\nIn that case so Tesla don't want to be in that spot no they don't want to be in any spotlight that so we just got to get the building\nCars\nConsistently ... why why did he leave the the venture capital market anyway and go sell bonds stardust diluting the shares I suppose\nWanting to keep that ... believing is on hype that he's going to pull it off\nAnd maybe in time he will it's just gosh it's long ways to go doing that\nChairman lamp or you know I had bought a few hundred dollars worth of tools a lot set late September they're just some of those strange things I felt I might need just like a number of other things I have is\nIf I needed I have a good price\nAnd and then in this they print out these bonus points and such if you come back this month and by salt and you get thirty three dollars towards it I don't know what the minimum is you're going to buy it didn't really say and go to the website was kind of\nIt was going to take more than a couple of minutes to figure it out so I moved on so I went in there yesterday and bought a couple of things but I showed them I was thinking I said well how do I take advantage of these thirty three thousand points which a thousand points get you a dollar\nSo he said well let's look it up well I hadn't even been credited about my points you know the white September ... couple of weeks ago now\nSo I I should have already been credit so it got me to thinking so when I\nArrived back home I said I've got to look into what's going on with his points in another thought came to my what if you just want me to the previous time by some warranty on something of course I said no\nSo what happens if you do have a warrant to see what happens at warranty if the company goes under to bankrupt while going bankruptcy is kind of the ... thing so it depends you know and also those pension holders they're the largest\nCreditor it just was undisclosed the male by the federal pension court but they're listed as the number one creditor on ballistic creditors so but hey if I've got a warrant the dilemma credit ... thing breaks yo you said you're going to take care of it\nYeah and see that so what happens is in bankruptcy\nAnd probably why they haven't been credited why would they credit them if they're going to make them all go away all these points they have out there\nIf you didn't ... you might not get to redeem them now because the points can go completely away in bankruptcy and so Ken the warranties on all the stuff as well so it makes you know a\nMember of General Motors when they went through bankruptcy\nThey unloaded a lot of ... liabilities out there why didn't you down to NATO yeah when they did bankruptcy back that did that void people's warranties\nFor a traffic is at a standstill you need to know traffic reports mornings at afternoons won Utah\nFor nine WVU\nAre a service economy our economy's driven by service were eighty plus percent of our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation is services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to save anything that raises the price is a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government has a pair of it's just another tax\nBefore we're close out here when I was a real quick here to get from a grade on the economy a through at what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents in pretty good regulations are dying and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing as subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way but the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every\nEvery month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL through saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Walmart and\nI was gonna say Sears alright piece years R. I. P. but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me be able to romp also I've heard that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct\nOr there is a very clear history of the currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity is very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that\nRon Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that he can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't like to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gregory Ricks and Associates", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "18"}
