I don't I don't know nothing about I'll go with my okay I don't\nReally know you really don't know about our ice and such do you understand how Social Security works not really going to\nBe okay well there's a benefit but if you're starting at age sixty two you're taking almost eight thirty percent reduction from what would be the value of your full retirement age so depending on your date of birth that's probably\nFor a for use probably going to be a sixty seven to get the full financial benefit so it depends on your work history have you received a Social Security statement lightly\n... no not not as probably the one maybe ten years ago maybe okay\nSo that's why also you might want to go to ss said dot Gov that's a Social Security administration dot Gov\nAnd sign up for your Social Security account on line so you can see what you're earning sister years and it will also tell you what your benefit would be at age sixty two\nAt your full retirement age which I'm assuming is sixty seven and also if you wait to eight Seventy so based on what you saved\nAll you have is Social Security at this time and you're going to need to save a substantial portion of your income to impact that at all it's not about the return it's not about risk it's how much you can put away\nAnd the thing is when you start looking at those numbers and you're making forty five or fifty to fifty five thousand a year it varies we understand your Social Security is going to be one heck of a lot less than that\nAnd then you're reducing it even more because you're wanting to turn it on at eight sixty two my recommendation just on this little bit of information is\nWork longer than stopping at age sixty to in fact work as long as you possibly can up towards Seventy because that means you're getting a larger Social Security benefit\nOf a ... of his boss I guess it was more and Michael's but mine but somebody else screams very drawn quitting I'm not at all thing and then when he went home and it

you are not allowed to make the cuisine\nOf another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept\nBecause all culture\nBorrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time in fact\nIf you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a ... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting me think of as a very ... northern\nNortheastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes
