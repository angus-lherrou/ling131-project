and then it crushes you and continue dropping down and then it starts buying up then it gives you some more down moves before it continues\nDriving up and then where he's talking about it kind of be in sideways yeah for\nThis year it is sideways with a downward trend but that's looking at a two hundred a moving average so let's go back and look at\n\nA shorter period now what we're looking at is\nWe're looking at a one year chart basically there's a number of things going on here but what I Want you to focus on is the daily or weekly that we're looking at here on this chart and what he's looking at is what he called about is this sideways motion\nThat it's had for several months so we can go back in may that this kind of topped out worked our way back up now it's approaching back towards\nThat top there then it sells back down to\nGo back one two three four months and creates a new low that's much lower because you see lower lower lower lower low and all along that you're creating lower highs and and all of a sudden breaks out and is approaching the top\nThat had happened some four months back\nSo what he's trying to do is time that to buy that on the debt by back up but it's been really difficult because it's mostly sideways and does it give you any real sense of it going anywhere and then all of a sudden\nIt takes off so you can kind of see that on some of the technicals that we're looking at here is you actually got a crossover right there that would kind of say\nA ... that is a by\nThat to sell then by right here but if we go back to the previous chart that we're looking at two hundred a moving average that's telling you sell sell sell so you have conflicting messages there just from a technical standpoint so what would I Do\nAvoid it if I hadn't already bought in and wrote this up\nFar away so sitting there at your day job watching your company stock\nTrying to trade it figure out when the best time to get in ... time selling me by back in now it\nIt does not give me that confident that's more day trader like world versus money manager and for money manager standpoint I'm not liking what I see to try anything like that\nWhy notice you're not talking about it or even referencing the fact that he's buying within a company plan there's no real advantage to that are changing your approach\nIt not all the time do you get a discount it's just the violent down there there's they might be getting some slight discount or no training costs or something like that on new shares\nBuddies also just trading the stock within the portfolio

doing something but it's\nTo see them on a positive mood today I almost want to do the junior treasury first 'cause that that will explain a lot of\nAbout what's going on because the the headline that they had for about half the day\nIn the lower third you know where they have the caption at the bottom of the screen on Fox Business it was rising interest rates way on the market the Dow Jones was down to tens of percent as viewers data tens of percent NASDAQ was basically flat it was up to point so it was a zero point zero three percent that's flat\nAnd the rest was down five tens of percent and who's getting blames tenure treasuries\nFive days ago they closed at about three point one eighty three percent we saw them a spike up\nOn October\nFour or six okay then we saw a spike up the next day and that was October third October fourth of three point to one eight percent that now they closed that day at about three point one nine then we saw them spike up on the fifth\nLet's see what was the high there there we go three point to four percent\nThey closed at\nAbout that then we saw a spike near the clothes on the eighth at three point to for I eat\nWell three point two five to\nThen on the nights we saw a spike up\nThat took us to about three point to six one per se that this is today and I'm about to say that and by the way that is today in case those weren't checking the calendar today like retirees and stuff on just sort of show so we\nWe saw a spike up and then we saw her clothes at three points to\nOne four percent so technically you're kind of looking at back that we go back to early in the trading two days to go back to get to this point so we had an interest rates moving up and then we kind of had a little bit of pulled back\nOn those today and that's kind of been what's going on is absorbing the interest rates moving up some point we were going to face this now\nWhen you kind of look going back to before the rate hike we were ... we were at what two point eight let me go back to that chart\nLet's go a little bit further out on the ... year chart and let me go to the warm months so\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist or something it's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle\nThat's the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by one of Raleigh who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case settled this she then sexually refused to pay and it has since\nMoved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to want to Brawley a few years ago and found that\nShe was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people say oh are you\nBlaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim there are these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk boy because Trump brought this up he gave his speech was earlier in a week mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today\nDemocrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member member when he says he those those uh those speeches about the snow and then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would\nGo into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless you all you do as little Bloomberg\nEspanol ... I I that was great that was great those are simple retires producer Mike\nMayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he's spoken order just let it let New Yorkers know that uh you know the snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you do that was only a scene the Blasio come and I know we we didn't know what we had\nYou see the Blasio are read by the way so there's the mayor of New York city and gave me a needs to be told that a major city hit somebody ... was talking to housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt cause you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess per hour we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd then when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the math anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's gonna run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have a\nLarge number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped bless\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that you know it looks bad and look and then they they point to the fact that New York is in", "show_name": "Gregory Ricks and Associates", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "10"}
