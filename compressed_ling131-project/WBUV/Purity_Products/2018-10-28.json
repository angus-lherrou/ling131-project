{"month": "10", "state": "MS", "station": "WBUV", "content": "And really if you just get on one of those sites and enter your PSA information that will take care of getting in ... I just wanted to save me a little work there\nOn this week's edition of the city desk pod cast from the city of Alexi they focused on the status at the singer theater and some repairs and other city issues\nSo we're going to start out by sharing that with the\n\n[noise]\nCity desk news interviews from city hall Biloxi and now the host of our program city desk\nPublic affairs manager for the city of Biloxi Mr Vincent ...\nGood morning William ... we are recording this program on Thursday October twenty fifth and it's ten thirty six in the morning here for the city hall and joining me after a week long sabbatical\nIs sue sue your dogs' fault and public affairs specialist for the city of all let's say\nAnd learning you jump right into yesterday and I'm going to say that you would but again what's going on with the sangre theater\nAnd the thing is a theater um they are continuing to mark on repairs for this thing in theater and now it's been a long process but there is a process to go to in the city wants to make sure that everything is done to correct\nWhat they have done if they have reviewed the outside of what we're parents that are needed in addition to that they had to go in and find out what\nThe structure was made up a\nIt was not a lot of good detailed information that might sound bombing them in the building was down in like Nineteen twenty nine we've had storms and hurricanes and stuff like that so they had to go and be fine detailed information and then they also had to actually go in and find out what destruction was night after that has taken us a while\nIn that research that they find anything like historical old switches papers documents Markey's old letters I mean that places now\nLadders but they did find some old they were talking about an old information like that\nBut but what and so they know that when they're at right now is they are the engineers and architects are working with the history and our guide to find out what materials\nThey can use to repaint make these repairs they also see the need for repairs to their flight power which is the back part that kind of tell her back part not going to\nDo and what was the tower is whenever you go see your production and they're changing the sets when they raised the sets high up in the air that's where they go into the tower\nAnd they see that that part I mean the most immediate attention so they're going to work on repairing that question I think at the ... material sees hopefully the ads will go out and then they share work without in the beginning of next year and they simply anti next year\nAn abstract question but related that used to be a world class for mayor sangre brothers motion picture house and they're still holes in the war in the back at cetera are they thinking about restoring that you can actually show movies\nActually what they did is do their research they found a lot of old newspaper articles in photographs of what the outside in the inside and look like back then the Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirty are they going to do their best to restore what they can the best to\nThat air but then when the when we we've had that fly tower and they're going to go out for the ads to repair the out how to work with we talked about that before that's just yelling Nebraska and and we pairing that and the reason\nThat I'm aging the AC on the race and we've had that and how well hopefully you go out to visit sometime next year and of course they complete that then they got to work on the inside but they got to go through that process and evaluating what needs to be done and going out for bed and then working on that\nPart so it's a long process\nAnd they see the engineers architects knows that it is that we want to make sure that it is done right and that it will be able to be used for for years to come\nAnd we want to make sure people know that it's not just sitting over there there is work going on just because\nYou can't see it that is because they have to do the specifications associate you bought the specifications for construction and go out for beards and everything along every step of the way as you noted has to be approved\nBy the Mississippi department of our cats in history since that senator is on the national registry of historic places one interesting thing that came up in the wake of Katrina when ever said he wanted to make repairs to the inside of the bullets\nThe White House the bullets\nThe White House has a cast iron structure but inside the\nThe the tunnel\nBut to ... is a it's one with bricks and the issue was they couldn't just go by bricks off the shelf and the reason they could use today style Briggs is because they are heavier they are bigger so if you were to replace parts of the\nWall inside the White House with bricks made today they would crush the other ... because of the weight so they had to be careful in\nIn what materials they're huge which is another part of this anger process\nSo it it's time consuming and it and it is a it it's something that frustrating for people because the Gulf Coast symphony orchestras a great example they were supposed to start their season in September and the sangre they started their season in September but they were not in the sangre John\nMcFarland our good friend who is executive director of the Gulf Coast symphony said it's like a football team play every game as in a way again so\nI Would appreciate everyone's patience\nAnd I said the city deck and other facilities such as I'd like to visit or senator down it's not just in the ... center\nThat day I have opened for\nOther groups that used to use the saying where they can still have their events in Biloxi and when that spaces as well\nAnd remember folks when this is done with the amount of the study is detail you're going to have\nA benchmark you have a slice of Americana as a show place no one else will have\nGoes back to the ball bill or a think Nineteen twenty nine years or so\nThe one of the ways that we are going to pay for this is the mayor's been looking for our cops in history money he's been looking for grant money are we thought we had some federal money tied up for it but to federal money was ruled as ineligible for that even though federal money had been used book for\nThere's been a change in that determination but right now America which is proposing to the members of the city council people just going to borrowing fourteen million dollars to keep major projects moving that we have been underway right now\nWe're talking about bricks and mortar stuff and we're talking about design and engineering or a large portion of the fourteen million or in that figures like five and a half million would be spending more marketing on water Seward drainage sidewalks et cetera\nThis goes along with the promises that the city made so long ago to upgrade all\nOf of the community\nTo city levels services that they expect and deserved a there are also in the fourteen million dollar bond is repairs to the cedar lake bridge the seed Oleg ... it it can handle fire trucks right now it can't\nHandle the way the vehicles that may need to go across seas or like bridge the cedar lake bridges at to see like exit go north probably about two or three miles is what is known as a swing you know it's kind of candle\nWhere you put it on a on a huge structure in the bridge swings open when folks come\nIt's a little while and bridge fortunately does not have to move or open a lot for marine traffic\nThe mayor's also looking at using some of the fourteen million dollars for upgrades of the main street braille crossing one important thing to know about the fourteen\nMillion is that a share of the fourteen million dollars is the city's twenty percent match to get eighty percent in federal\nSo some of it is tied up in that their main street crossing is a great example of that\nWill market sidewalks as so there's another great example\nTwo million dollars of the fourteen\nMillion dollars is a lot into this anger theater to keep that were going on\nThe past we've talked about the new pope spare bridge we would like to sing one day we've talked about the pending pending I say because it is going to be happening\nThe extension of pops ferry road all the way down the highway Ninety we've got design engineers who are looking at the right away we need to buy they are all making steps on these big projects even though they're years away even though we don't have the funding for the overall project\nYou still have to keep it moving and get in bed ready it's called to where it's ready to go out forbids when we do secure that money we want to be ready to go so\nLast year at the state of the city we made a big deal about happening now\nWell as my two hundred and said we want to be able to say happening tomorrow as well\nThat children are good reasons that the mayor's looking to move forward with this or fourteen million dollar bond borrowing fourteen million would require no tax increase the the money to pay it back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products",
