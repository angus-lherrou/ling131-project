possible policy responses to the report\nOn the hard fought battle over the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh marked a new low in public discourse colonel Frank Ryan us MC retired has an

unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here do story through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grow their naturally trying to better their situation the only way they can is a natural barriers are putting their place usually of the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety\nAnd so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign in some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep\nEconomic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings too low low\nYou're hearing about a smaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's as always the case a growing economy generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties\nMost of us didn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay\nAnd that serves as a fairly ... so I never worried\nAbout that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like that probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so\nThe fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely brought back what we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor costs at least sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nIn North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wish without a meddling there is a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly like that\nBut let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact that has a just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but can't really do that you know solve the bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but it can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to\nSet the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that and so I think the feds impact is vastly over it people say well you know they're going to reduce interest rates and that's going to ease up credit\nThat's the equivalent of married ablaze you send in New York how apartment rents are too high I'm going to reduce how much landlords can charge for apartments all he would do is just cause scarcity and the same way of markets actually responded the fed\nThe fat to the best cause scarcity by trying to artificially lower rates below what they normally it in the marketplace so my point is is is we in the real economy we largely act as the fed doesn't exist that that sort of an ... that sort of an\nPosition but I Believe it will be increasingly common place in the coming years the fed has been\nAnd on a rate increase I won't say binge because they've been doing it in smaller increments this past week it did seem to get her the markets a little bit will the fed raising the the rates will that cause the economy to cool off or given your previous comment cereal really don't think it's going to have much impact in the long run\nNow I don't think it will have much of an impact in all let's remember the fact kept rates low mountains here or the rate at him set for years and years for basically two thousand nine until what about twenty Fifteen or twenty sixteen\nThere is no major economic boom during that time the fed can change reality when when we're when we go to the market to borrow money we're borrowing access to real resources\nTo trucks tractors computers desks chairs most of all human labor that that can expand the amount of that available I Can't make these resources cheap and so I think the answer is is to always remind ourselves with\nThe fat as just another entity try and influence things not very well\nWe have been talking with John ... who is the director of the center for economic freedom at freedomworks John ... have been about freedomworks also working folks go on the Web to get more information from your\nFreedomworks is a wonderful organization based in Washington DC that makes the essential point that Washington is not going to change in less politicians realize that they're the voters are changing that they basically see what\nThey're dealing and your website is W. W. W. freedomworks dot org John Tammy freedomworks John thank you for being here thanks for having me\nAnd the route that the club for growth keeping an eye on what's been a fascinating last few weeks in the nation's capital to say the least dandy good to have you here\nHi thanks for having lemon\nBrett Kavanaugh's now an associate justice of the Supreme Court in the United states but the political ramifications likely are going to be felt for weeks as we head into the general election Andy is the Kavanaugh\nConfirmation process is this going to be an overall plus for Republicans\nWell it is so far I mean obviously we get a a conservative justice that will help make the court of conservative majority\nThat could last very long time and who knows Trump may even get another pick before the end of his first term but with regards to politics there's evidence that Republican voter enthusiasm has picked up you saw some recent polls that showed\nThat the percentage of voters who think this election is very important used to be deep plus ten\nMeaning the Democrats are ten percent more enthusiastic devote the Republicans and that has shrunk to D plus too since the Kavanaugh fight so if Republicans show up at the polls was just as much enthusiasm as Democrats\nThan the Republicans will keep the house and they will likely add to the Senate majority so the Kevin a thing as a big deal and let me point out that the Democrats want to politicize it to the Jerry ... a house Democrat\nHe said that if the Democrats are in charge\nHe will be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he said his first thing will be to invest the capital and I assume the next thing they do is going to try and impeached jump so\nThat they're going to certainly keep Republican", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "14"}
