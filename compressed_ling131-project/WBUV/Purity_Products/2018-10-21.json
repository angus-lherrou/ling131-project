V. in Biloxi news radio some kid WNPR ... Ninety nine and five FM the dragon immobile new shuttle launch coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines\nChili Bennett has an industrial gift in Biloxi\nYeah we've talked a little bit about the Harrison county school bond issue at something that keeps coming up it's going to be on the ballot November six\nAnd we've got the Harrison county school district assistant superintendent Sherry Washburn in Studio with us this morning to kind of break down the whole school bond issue for us so I Know there are some things you really want to make the voters aware of so I'll let you started there\nOh thank you very much Kelly I appreciate you having me on the air today\nI Am from Harrison county school district as assistant superintendent but I'm also speaking today as a citizen of hairs and county school district um I live in the county and the district is on has on the ballot for November six\nAnd no tax increase bond issue\nAnd districts trying to being very responsible\nAnd not increased taxes because of the bond issue so I have no control if the if taxes increase obviously that's the board of supervisors but because of this bond issue\nWe're planning on paying actually ... pain the bond we had that money already set aside that we know that will pay on it\nUm for for years to come but um we just paid off the debt service in December and that that payment we have rolled over and ready to pay on this on this issue if it passes\nThey'll miss when that's the first time hearing on this because I think when most people here are school bonds fifty five million was the amount that they keep giving out\nAnd most people just automatically assume that's going to include a tax increase of some sort and the county so you're telling me you already had to bond out that's you're just going to roll it over so the way it was being paid is just going to continue\nAt no cost increase that's exactly right you know tax increase bond that we feel like\nThat's that's a definitely now point for voters obviously we would like voters to be well aware of what we want to use that money for that when you start talking about the Fifteen thousand kids that we serve and Harrison county school district\nWhere growing every day on the board of supervisors the of the city councils they all are very well aware of where construction is happening we have to housing developments just in on the market area six hundred and four hundred pounds\nObviously they won't be built overnight but there are other projects in the county all across the county that are have been approved and they haven't even started breaking ground on yet\nWe know we've got to prepare for that ground so when that preparation we're going to um we're going to set aside sixteen million dollars it's already been set 'em up ... Harrison county school districts funds to put up with the fifty five million\nBond issue if it passes will be able to build new schools one in the east side of the district one on the west side of the district\nWe also have a major costs that we have included in that bond you have to lay out your plan\nAnd that plan is for um warnings of dollars to be spent just renovating um north of port school will also put money into um security and safety in and all of our schools eventually but the bond as you were able to immediately\nDo some security measures adding security measures to about nine or ten of our schools\nAnd that's a big issue with students today so are there um upgrades that need to be done in regard as the security I'm just kind of curious I haven't been to every school in the Harrison county school district\nYou know or they're older schools that need these upgrades or what exactly is is there a little bit of everything that kind of a mixed bag school building wise\nYes ma'am I'm Glad you asked that question Kelly because we have twenty to school with those twenty two schools some of them were built Twenty years ago some of them were built years and years ago I I'm not even sure the date of\nOf some of her older schools I Know will market school for instance on the registry because of the age of the building\nUm we're very proud to have those buildings but when they were built security was not\nThe the the design mhm and today's schools security is more of the design and when you talk about those older schools because of our population student population and the growth that we have we can't just abandon those buildings we have to update upgrade is building\nNow there was another thing I wanted to bring up and that is you know you can't really talk about a school bond issue without mentioning the fact that Biloxi in Gulfport are both trying to get this off the ballot basically they want more time to discuss it\nI Know it's a it's it's rare to see that happen but I'm kind of curious\nUm because I got a press release from the Harrison county school district yesterday kind of explaining why kids in the city is a Biloxi in Gulfport go to Harrison county school and that's not really a decision\nThat's made by you is it it's a state and and it's a state thing yes ma'am\nI'm I'm Glad you asked that question let's go back to um which you originally said\nWhen um the the\nCity councils and other entities have asked for it to be postponed number one it is on the ballot has been being voted on with absentee voters a for a month or so so that's that's done ... idea of postponing\nI don't know how anybody would want to postpone for a year or for a month more than where we are now when you're talking about the security and safety issue [noise]\nUnfortunately we ran out of time there I'm sure there was a lot more we could get into but for their part the city of Alexi came out earlier this week actually on October six\nTeens and this was their statement to the press residents of Biloxi whether they live and will market eagle point or other areas\nOut to be able to a tenth Alexi public schools mayor Andrew folk yell at his lungs that and on Tuesday to Biloxi city council asked the Harrison county school board to help make that happen they say when will market in eagle point became part of Alexi in Nineteen Ninety nine Biloxi public schools didn't grow with the city and as a result\nThose residents remain in the Harrison county school district where taxes are higher than Biloxi about two hundred and fifty dollars a year higher on a two hundred thousand dollar home\nThis is from the city of Alexi again now mayor Gillett says this isn't an issue for him he says he's asked about this and he's been asked about this more than once since he became mayor in twenty Fifteen and now the county school board is asking Biloxi residents north of by ten and Dan eagle point\nDevoted to borrow fifty five billion for improvements to schools in Gulfport ... the mayor says frankly if you live in Biloxi you ought to be able to enjoy the lower school taxes we have and you ought to be able to attend but Biloxi public schools and a rated district with three blue ribbon schools I think it's that simple\nThe city council did vote unanimously save for councilmember Nathan beret who abstained\nTo ask the county school board to delay the November fifth referendum on borrowing money and instead for the two school boards to discuss other reasonable feasible alternative if the bond vote is not delayed the Biloxi mayor and the black sea council\nAre saying that those are that are voting should say now so\nIt is as something that the Lexie has has come out and stated and they're very clear about their position on this the city of Gulfport has made attempts to get this off the ballot as well\nI'm just trying to present all the different sides of this issue so that voters will have the most informed information when they had to the polls on November sex 'cause at this point it's still on the ballot and like uh the Harrison county um\nSchool ... ... assistant superintendent cherry Washburn said in that interview on Gulf Coast mornings on friday you know we've already got absentee voters voting on the issue let's\nMove on to something else you've got a group called one coast and they're getting together supplies for those that were impacted by hurricane Michael so over the next few weeks the task force which is made up at city and county employees throughout Harrison county\nAre planning to travel to Florida to deliver supplies to hurricane Michael survivors and first responders as they began what is going to be a very long process of cleaning up after the storm I think folks that lived through Katrina\nKnow exactly what they're dealing with there so the first caravan of supplies left on friday at six o'clock\nBut you've still got an opportunity to help with this Michael relief\nYou can do to eight items that any fire department and Harrison county that includes department outside the city limits", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "21"}
