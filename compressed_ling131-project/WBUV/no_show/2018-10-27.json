[noise]\n... folks were back this is Kim marched and you're listening to what's working with ... with Chris ... says the president uh Budweiser Bush distributing company we're talking about the changes in the ...\nUh today you were talking about ... the number ... ... s Q use available today versus a what it used to be I remember back in the day\nWhen I first started noticing beer I guess as a teenager and became a tune to the commercials that there seem to be a one single\nRivalry blood or Bud Light versus Miller light and I don't see that rivalry is much more is there a a U.S versus them rivalry now or oh where's it going\nOh it's their trust me it's it's their weight we uh we do we we fight\nPretty hard in the streets actually I'm I'm everybody's friendly and everybody gets along well I'll just trying to do business but uh um the the pie is only so big so if if we're both going to get a piece I Want the bigger pays [laughter]\nYou know the the um we we were we were talking a little bit about the the ... proliferate and and and how um you know I have seen I remember walking our warehouse and it's maybe\nFifteen Years ago and we had one hundred ski is and I and I was walking around with our warehouse manager at the time and we were just didn't want to hundreds skews oh my gosh\nWell now we're at three hundred brands forty two suppliers\nEight hundred and fifty skews argues Syria yeah and and and we're probably on the the the lower end for for many people in our business and a and there's no there's no sign of slow down\nA ... will be bringing in a another supplier over the course of the next month or who will be bringing in with them you know another dozen fifteenth cues and that's just the that's how it works\nThey call it you might get an [laughter] but [noise] but uh but but you know on the on the competitive sat on the big Branstad in our market which is really\nWhat I what I Know most um but in in our market the five biggest brands are Bud Light ... Miller Lite Coors Light and then Budweiser or in that order and those five brands makeup fifty five percent of all beer sales so\n[noise] you know yes the the craft\nA items are coming in and doing great and that is wonderful because you know anything we can do to bring anybody into beer in any way shape or form is best for our overall business you know the rising tide lifts all ships\nAt the same time does fat brands are fifty five percent of the business and just the the overwhelming amount of volume still resides in a very few I'm a number of brands\nWhat were those five ... Fifteen Years ago\nYou know Budweiser would have been much higher Bud Light was still up there ultra wasn't they've been really on the on the radar at all\n[noise] I bet your natural light was higher ... was still on there\nWere they Seventy percent of all beer sales eighty percent yeah\nI bet you not maybe not that much but probably more like sixty five ah you know in our market crashed now represents somewhere around six percent of the total sales um and um\nWhat is what is one thing that has really increased as the um Mexican imports does does have really been doing well across the country and in our market sit as a shot up\nYou're going to be careful how you talk about Mexican imports in our political environment today yeah\nI guess I guess one does does it want yeah we're talking about Mexican imports butter beer right yes that's correct the Corona's up to the world understood I'm curious and five seniors excuse are going to continue to increase\nDo you see it going back to the other way do you see the pendulum returning or is this the future you know it reminds me of the wind market wine ... always been full is that the future\nYeah now [noise] so so ... it's really not good for the business and and and I I have seen it or I should say this is my opinion that it's not very good for the business and\nBecause it's a premium in the ... of our product are commodity as they should I should say of our product\nThat branding is so important and beer I'm ... not just the big brands like we were talking about the diligently on Bud Light but breading on the craft side is so important you know when you think about that some of these local guys like the guys over feral Berlin company who do a great job\nAnd they work their tails off on\nTheir marketing pieces what they look like their story explaining to people you know what the risk that they took to build this brewery and\nOn and on and on and on but then in the in the bar what you hear so many consumers ask is uh you got an MPA on draft oh gosh and they say in ... yes right exactly so you know if the\nAnswer is fair hoped and that's great the pharaoh guy and we hope that it is then the fair had guys get that sale but if it's not it's just it's just whatever I PA is on or whatever pale is on or whatever bond is on there is no\n... and that's not a very good thing for the ... that's what happened to line you know why you have sharp ... drinkers who go stand in front of the ... section and they're they're looking for a ten dollar bottle or a twenty dollar\nBottle or they're not looking for a brand and uh and I hate I hate to think that that might happen to be here um because we have a way better stories than they do anyway\nYeah will tell me about I Know a guy his name is Michael and Michael lives and breathes by Budweiser I Love Michael I Know you do he um the lights all he is to the bone a Budweiser guy\nBut tell me about your customer tell me about your dream customer tell me about Michael what is his background what ... what ... what makes him what has given him such intense loyalty to Budweiser\nIs a guy I Would like to take a long walk on the beach with [laughter] I Am a fan of those ... you know you know that he talked about the change in the business right there used to be so much more of that of of just the tried and true loyalist you know\nThis is my brand this is my badge it represents who I Am and it represents you know so much of me and\nI'm I'm I ... I Love that guy now\nAnother thing along with all those uh eight hundred Brazilians skews or the samplers you know and they just want to sample what's new what's next um there's a thing that that that's going on in the bars are called rotation nation\nAnd it and that is the uh the the taps that you see the different you know the draft lines that are that a customer will have ... they ... they want what's new they want to just switch it out there is no you know this is my eight taps and that's what's going to be there in two months they met all the different in two weeks [noise]\nAnd and it it it again it does the good in the bad right it's great because it sampling and it's keeping our industry fresh and new and on the edge at the same time Michael is just such a fantastic guy\nUm and in that respect that so much you know I'd add part of my business is going out and you go into a bar and somebody's drinking a competitive product and you say hey\nYou know Stanley a Michael's over there to get a Budweiser I'd like to buy you a Budweiser just like him\nAnd I respect when Stanley says no\nI'm like this Brant even though it's not mine [noise] um I Love that guy\nSo even though you are offering to buy this guy a beer\nWhich would be different than the one he's drinking he says no thank you that's right no thank you I Will pay for this long this one because I'm like you know whatever in the world it might be yeah so that if they take the beer by the way they do you know in my experience\nThere's a there's two types of beer is your favorite beer and there's free [laughter]\nThe millennials you mentioned the millennials huge market ... number say they are as many as Ninety million people in the nation\nAnd my assumption is that if you make an impression on them early they will stay with you is that not proving the case 'cause they're they're they're consumer product companies that will do anything to get in front of them to try to curry favor with them at an impressionable age is that a lost cause in here\nI think that they are just ... from everything I've read and and um you know\nI I I don't spend a tremendous amount of time studying that other than just what you pick up from the market and your customers but they are a fickle bunch um from from everything and so there are a part of this wanting the next new thing and the rotation nation and and and everything\nThat I was talking about I'm certainly you know there are a part of that um\nBut but I also think that that ah it's just really hard to pin him down in going back to your idea of Michael ... your Budweiser drink are Michael he drinks but when it goes to the bar he drinks bud when he goes to the beach he drinks but when he\nGoes out to dinner with a family um the the millennial", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "27"}
