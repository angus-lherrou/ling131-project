outside the military\nI think it's a little bit of both um I've had amazing mentors along the way from from my parents to as I told you general salmon smothered professors up painting city and you know a beautiful thing about the military is you learn from remarkable leaders and you also learned from some atrocious leaders and you learn what you don't want to be\nAnd so that experience if you put it into perspective I'm also grateful or because I'm able to take that back and say if I ever feel like I'm\nHeaded that direction I Need to take a moment\nAnd and look and say that's I remember when I did that er when so and so I\nWas leaning that way when we're in combat and he was detrimental to them around the strength and just the overall pulse of the organization so don't go down that road\nThere is a movement bread we had a guest on a earlier I'm a I'm I'm guessing now about five six months ago towards mindfulness in leadership\nWhich is if I'm not mistaken kind of a Buddhist term of a a different approach to leadership of being very president to each and every moment of what is going on around you as well as what is going on inside of you are you familiar with the mindfulness movement\nAbsolutely and and I I Would agree with it I think that that if you look at the model the framework that we're just talking about camp so self awareness\nIs is being hyper aware of your environment of the ripple effect you have on others which is that engagement piece that's how you show up so the ... show up I can either be rolling a hand grenade down the office hallway and everybody\n... away when I when I enter the building or\nThat can be president and I can be looking them in the eye\nAnd meaningful conversations connecting with everybody that I interact with because that's how I Want to be remembered if if I wasn't here tomorrow what are they going to say about me when I'm Out here as it can be positive or somebody a sigh of relief that that that that guy's no longer order this company and\nThat's the impact that we [noise] if if it's going to if we want to affect performance\nIn the most positive uplifting way\nAnd if they know I've got their back and I know they've got mine\nThey're going to be working that much harder to help us hit our goals because it's something that we're all in alignment on and and the mindfulness is is the three sixty based because of reflection\nAnd you're not stopping like we do every Ninety Days we do the Ninety Days sprints this kind of what we call it the more stopping them we're collecting we have a a questionnaire that we send out before we do the performance reviews\nIs a self reflective piece but it also ask questions such as what can I Do to the better reader for you and this department and you would be amazed for somebody answers we've gotten\nIn where the leaders have really at that at that wall and said wow I never realized I was doing and that is not what I Want to be known poor\nSo thank you for having the courage\nWhich is one of our core values to stand up and tell me that I was doing that\nWe're moving into a break here and I want to get a question in before the break and that is of these are all these items here on a mouse describe them you've got awareness engagement performance and reflection\nWhat are the majority of people in your world who are not part of this reflective stuff\nUh that you won't teach but if you were to go through an airport in in look in a crowd of people would or most of them we just on awareness engagement performance a reflection\nOf our undoubtedly say awareness I think there's so many people that that walked through life and never really stop and and try to gain any trouble understanding of self awareness\nAs just they use the the cop out that you hear of this has always done it or everybody ... on to me and adapt to me and again\nSure has that worked for people absolutely have you have you known of plenty of people that have made billions of dollars that I wouldn't consider a leader at all absolutely but if they really want to be able to ever arm that title [noise]\nThen they gotta limit day in and day out and that starts with self awareness\nWas finished we're moving on into break we'll be back and bread I Want you to really combat\nTo business if it's even possible or even similar you're listening to what's working

he went to officer candidate school Bremer re he's won the bronze store bread\nDid I see twice is that right that is correct second bronze star and a majority of service medal for leadership in the seventh special forces group brand can combat in any way be similar to business\nI think it can I think you've got to really look at what you're thinking\nAbout when you want to make that parallel but

well we were doing with winning that village over and so she made it his personal mission to really hone in on us and started I'm putting daisy chain where they where they\nBuried different improvised
