Fox News is that a Republican leader hoping to make good on its promise to hold a confirmation but when I'm Brett Kavanaugh this week it's not clear if he has the votes doctors can't help it live on Capitol Hill\nClear proof one way or the other factor it in\nWe heard so much what oh she'd be the polygraph I shouldn't say well that was maybe forty and right there she was cleared by the polygraph maybe you could say polygraph said that she was not being deceptive she was being truthful what if she knows how to discipline a polygraph\nIf she knows how to do that by the way that would indicate that you lied under oath and if you lied under oath about the polygraph by the way I still don't believe that she took the polygraph not knowing she was going to come forward so I've always thought that was a lie but if you wrote about taking the polygraph than\nWe know that she's not delusional then she's actually a malicious actor here I've given that we've been told including by shooting US Senators that millions of lives are at stake\nMillions of women's lives are at stake if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court which is in the same thing to say but it is pretty widespread among Democrats\nWhy is it so hard to believe that somebody would try and do something that they would view as a great act of heroism and that they will be heralded for on the left for generations to come for that you think that that's that show one\nSingle so\nNot credible really I find that hard to believe\nThose who today we're criticizing Trump for weighing in here seem to forget that just because there are allegations are now falling apart it doesn't mean that the rest of us have forgotten how disgusting how disgraceful how underhanded they have been all along in their effort to try and derailed his cabinet nomination\nThat has been their purpose and they have been willing to do anything and everything in order to get there that they're now is a more defensive position than they have been\nYou know ... I saw had a another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties there was drinking insects in and knew the cabinet was that these parties I mean at what point are we just putting highschool drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here I mean there there's no names there's no allegations of specific criminality\nYeah ... I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury it also doesn't prove anything\nThey have an easy thing it was election I keep I keep running into they should be ashamed about how they have no shame and they view this as an ends justifies the means to a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here this has never been this\nHas never been about getting to the truth is delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense this has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what\nThis is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time it's going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't\nDone enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to this is where I'm most concerned\nTo how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other and that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from\nThis brink of partisan a base is if\nKavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb\nIf Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around Trump\nOh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing are there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as very came across to me it's very strange in a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are\nGoing on in the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my password I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford\nDishes ethically him a ...\nCompletely untenable unacceptable position that will lead a monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that\nPerson or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system is supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed\nBut this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford situation you'll notice the second the second\nAllegation from Ramirez and the third from sweat Nick ... they're barely even discussing that any more\nJust\n... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying\nAs we found out with her near as and in the third case with sweat neck it's an intelligence test watch that interview with Julie sweating it where she's talking about gang rape and being and in community college and hanging out with high school kids in all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if\nYou think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment in analysis are ah are lacking\nTo say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the Dems here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gaps there's the whole there's women who are lying are we to believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is also honest\nI have a hard time believing that\nNow we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said to us in the last week in week and a half and we need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down capital now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh there's a\nTemperament issue here's we discuss yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nTheir stuff in his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air that they the Senate with Feinstein includes just you're basing themselves for the amusement of the

a\nFrank\nThat ah and then and\nConsumers and or substances or or do we were all\nMy records six pack or an hour before uh before going back to class or things like that\nWhen Obama talked to the media about his predilection for illegal drugs fighting in his own words there are a being a thug when he was younger it was evidence of a kind of authenticity and I guess the charm and how he oh yeah that's right Obama he was living living life on the wild side back in the\nDay and he we also know that he admitted to doing cocaine which I Would say is in a different category for most people than alcohol or even marijuana right cocaine is that's a whole step above and no one had any issue with it in the media at least nobody somebody you might have been an issue with it but the media to having an issue with it\nAnd now we're supposed to be of jak his cabinet was drinking beer\nThat's what this really about the behavior\nThat involved a all kinds of illegal stuff that Obama did was held up as being cool by the way I I Know I'm just going to say this is just my my sense of it I got I got no evidence for back back this up you know you could say maybe bucks credible when\nThat is maybe not I don't believe they're bomb ago the fights I don't believe it I think he said it because he thinks that makes it sound cool I don't believe that Obama got into fights you can tell me I'm Crazy but nope strikes me as a just I don't I don't see it I don't know and I never prove it one way or the other but just when he said it is\nNot really I don't think I don't think Obama's been at a fist fight in his whole life that would be my guest um but then again\nI'm just don't based on what's credible folks I don't I don't have any evidence from or the other just going based on what I think is credible here\nBut the double standard problem is a very big one whether we're talking about the Clintons and the sexual stuff that went on a with Bill Clinton whether we're talking about the way the media treated Bill Clinton's accusers versus the way the media treats lousy forwarded bloody forty sacrosanct\nWhy why can't we look into her past\nWhat she's made herself a center of national attention she did not have to do this I I also have never her civic duty\nThat was the justification for all this it was her civic duty really\nWho believes that she's an ideologue she's ... she's a left wing partisan and she thought she had a chance to take out a a game changing Supreme Court fifth vote that would have gone\nNot even that conservative by the way I think cabinet all I mean don't get me started on this I think Kevin I was going to be much closer to Roberts and a lot of people realize\nRoberts is the one who saved Obamacare\nI don't think the cabin 'cause I think Kavanaugh was going to have a kind of beat them judicial minimal ism approach\nUnlike what the left goes for which is well I like this and so now my opportunity to make it the law the land I don't think that that's what you can expect from Kavanaugh at all but you know Obama's past\nShortcomings ... illegal activity whatever that was all charming and grade and you know evidence that Obama was cool\nA Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties which ... in a whole different category of anything that Obama did I'm not trying to see I I can make these distinctions the left will say yeah capitals like Bill Cosby cars are idiots\nOr you know what Obama did is probably pretty normal teenager and young adult stuff am I trying to say that he was I think honesty is overstating it if anything just sound cool\nOr what Bill Clinton did when he was a full grown adult and governor of Arkansas and then later president was disgusting and illegal and horrific and the media coverage for um for eight years\nReally you you look back to the way that the media dealt with Bill Clinton and the sex abuse and sex scandals surrounding him and it's what gave us the conservative media that we have\nYou could even argue that people like me even the careers that we have now and the outlets that we have a new alternative means of getting information out there exist in the Drudge Report and talk radio and\nThey exist the way they do because the media sold the soul for Bill Clinton the nineties [noise] so you know that this stuff is not distant memory and this is not\nAn remember what people say oh the Clintons that was a

[noise]\nAnd there is no analogous response on the right it does not exist this is a problem of the left\nSpeaking of delusions and doc seeing fixation of different times is the New York times spent its\nInk on today so to speak from engage in suspect tax schemes as you recall I reach riches from his father\nIs very unusual for me to find myself trying to read a front page news papers story you know at a paper like this the New York times or big national paper and\nFind myself barely able to get through it uh this is I think it was twelve thousand words long is what I saw I mean this is like a novella\nAbout Trump and and here's the short version but I'll I'll get into what they're really trying to say or what what the purpose of all this is they're saying that Trump is in self made and that Trump and his whole family were engaged in quote suspect tax schemes\nNow is from self made not if not if you're going to say that he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and didn't get any money from his family of course not he got money for his family inherited a very large real estate portfolio and you know he was born rich no question about it\nNow has he built in ... in international brand an irrational recognizable brand that did not exist\nAre based on what he had been given inherited of course and did he inherited a political future than anyone ever think you'd be compressed the United states no\nSo I I don't think this is nearly as potent a criticism as the New York times thinks it is right but they're saying oh his books and the art a deal and all this stuff is\nIs a poke 'em I'd solved bunk nonsense\nThen there's the other part of it and and there's I when I say excruciating detail I really mean and they're like on any you know bought a whole bunch of white out to use for some paperwork back in Nineteen eighty seven and any I mean they're\nJust man this is an exhaustive they say it's based on a hundred thousand pages plus of documents in interviews and all this stuff and it felt like I was reading a hundred thousand pages of it myself\nReading that is a front page New York times story a or their audience you could only be reading this and could really care about this because they have trumped arrangement syndrome and this was in a sense a trumped arrangements syndrome manifesto\nThere's nobody could care that much about what Fred Trump Donald Trump's father did in terms of his business dealings really Thirty years ago\nTwenty years ago where does Trump's wealth come from and I couldn't help but read through this and and come to this this this kept popping up in my head that I as I was\nYes that's right I was lying by pool in Las Vegas for a while is nice you know get a little bit of sun although after about five minutes ago it's easy to too much sun for me to get the shade my Irish skin doesn't do well with it\nBut I couldn't help but think imagine if they had\nDone this kind of a deep dive into the finances of the Clinton crime family imagine if they had really spent effort looking into what the Clinton Foundation did and did not do what ways the Clintons were able to ah leverage\nThe funding that they were getting offensively for charitable purposes in order to support different aspects of their lifestyle but I've never seen a comprehensive media deep dive\nAny newspaper or any TV organization into what was really going on with the Clintons with the how is it that the Clintons were worth a hundred million dollars within a decade of leaving the White House a hundred million dollars plus\nRemember to have that you know you've got to make about a hundred and sixty hundred and Seventy million\nTo have to be worse to have a net worth of a hundred but how can they called us money\nWhat is it they didn't they didn't own a company they didn't create a product how they make all this money\nEach it's astonishing when you think about it oh by giving speeches are some really amazing speech you're fine I have the\nThat was kind of\nI'm sending a little more like George our banks instead of Hillary and my my Hillary is getting a little rusty folks had in a more Hillary impersonation um I did an area on impersonation out here at the conference\nPaddling plans you're doing yoga and stretching and everybody loved it so see already on a can appear anytime you needed to but they're talking about all these different from tax schemes and here's the IRS what is so dirty about those that are minds me in a sense of what they've done to Kavanaugh to all this has passed\nThe statute of limitations so so they can say oh you know we we think that he's a tax cheat and a criminal which we know\nHarry Reid said about Mitt Romney not long ago as well\nAnd it was a total lie but he said it on the floor of the Senate so he couldn't be sued forties he's legally free to say whatever he wants there and it was intended to just be a political black guy for Romney that Harry Reid gave him and that was all that was what was\nThe New York times says that Trump was engaged in these tax schemes that Trump was doing all this uh you know\nShady behind the scenes\nUm evading of what was due the government and I mean French drop here and from\nA Donald Trump as well they're saying this and we turn around and say well hold on a second this will never be adjudicated\nThis will never see the inside of a court so how do we do if they're telling the truth about this or not is anyone really going to dive into the hundred thousand pages and also what is the shady tax dealing really mean\nDo they have them ... writes on tax evasion no of course now they're saying that he you know did this and that and try to find all these different ways to avoid paying taxes really and avoidance of taxes is not criminal\nAvoidance of taxes is\nTaking advantage of the fact that the tax code is Seventy thousand plus pages it's a mess it's a disaster but liberals don't want to change it 'cause they like it and the government likes it and Republicans unfortunately in the Congress like it too\nBecause that's the single biggest ways that they can influence policy and engaging doling out favors to people which is the tax code\nI mean you you make changes attacks changed the whole country got to pass legislation you need the other side for that people pay attention that can be harder changes in the tax code giving people carve outs and giveaways wide Seventy thousand pages because it's a way for the Congress to pick winners and losers and do favors for donors\nSo Trump\nTry celebrities is the way the lot of other folks do two or he has in the past\nTwo I think it's good though I think we should have a flat tax and people said no book a fair tax whatever something like that it should be on a postcard that was one of the things that really did like about the cruise Canada see I Will say that he was very opposed the IRS and the way that it's currently constituted but it's based on Trump is just\nIt's boring long winded and there's not nearly as much there there is it like to think even though they've said they've gone through a hundred thousand\nPages must be must be must get tiresome to be such a a relentless Trump hater after a while but at the New York times I guess this is just this is what\nPushes them on you know this is what gets them going they really just want to focus in on how terrible Trump is at all times however they can whenever they can\nAnd they never get tired of it you know it is awesome though the economy someone was talking about next we'll get some
