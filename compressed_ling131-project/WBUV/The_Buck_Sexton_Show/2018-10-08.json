Cavanaugh I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLess ...

emotion is slogans is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding deal obliteration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades\nThey don't want you to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally\nWith sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts\nAnd that triggering they think justifies violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking\nPeople on streets acting like the maniacs they are and we see this\nFrom the way that the less reacts to political

respect acting with honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to mirror at\nThings that pop culture dominated by the left residuals but you realize that you can't be a true

left and managed to sink Kavanaugh it was the beginning of the end of any kind of honest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\n\nAnd there would have been this sense that\nOnce the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation he's the verdict\nAnd because they were deprived of that secret weapon because the

marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the

aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is where instinctive impulses lie\nThe end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged this is not going to lead\nTo good things for anyone is not going to lead to happy places for this country and I do fear it's only going to get worse because instead of learning from their losses the excuse them with delusions\nOf recognizing that the American people are not in fact on their side they take the position that they were treated you see it was Russia\nOr was that

told us and that she was some victims we have a presumption of innocence in this country and when I looked at the lack of any corroborating evidence including\nNo evidence from her very best friend who was present at the party I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant\nAnd China have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question their story she struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice um that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist but that is fake feminism\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that if she Hillary Clinton or no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department but she was I'm sure she's run that wasn't too but notice how quickly\nWill just attack attack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermines the power structure it's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left the hatred that much more because you're more of a danger because the face\nFull will see or departure and think why does that person go same is true with radical leftist feminists they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh\nMaybe\nMaybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to maybe there's something else here on and there were there were some people who came through noxious Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others\nUh I I gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gambled with\nThe Kavanaugh nomination by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's certainly seemed like a a cowardly move at the time to me that said\nWhen push came to shove flake did the right thing here at the moment he had to do it so I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus eater\nBut he deserves credit mansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real\nWest Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical leftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their\nCase and then that brings me to Murkowski now\nI don't know about wait wait before getting Murkowski Hi Ken I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal or a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um you know North Dakota in ... should oust high camp at the ... possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now Murkowski is not somebody who's ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she she pulled distant and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure it out or take let's see now really Mitchell figure it out later I Hope the American people are accountable\nUm I Hope that the people of Alaska\nK. E. N. I. up in the house you're listening to the show alive I Know you guys up there in Anchorage give you a high five\nI Hope that you do everything you can to mobilize and make sure that she is at the soon as possible moment no longer\nIn the United States Senate for what she did here it's not just about the ... for for me to the notion of having a conservative on on the Supreme Court that's important sure I'm not going to pretend like I'm not also invested in the politics here of course I Am but what was at stake here was so much more than that it was\nAnd they won't even have these so called the dose of the Senate or the media which you know media's budget cry babies but they wouldn't have them say that they shouldn't do that at least she just dodge the question the answer to this is like you know the answer to if somebody ask you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to if somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant and harassing them because of their politics\nIs let us know his owner quickly without question\nNo but\nShe won't say it because she knows where she to say that it would offend the less it would offend the activists\nThe Emily run a couch skis and Amy Schumer and others you love to just pray and\nYou know a list them all I Love the parade around and get arrested by the big mean police and the whole thing this is part of their political culture now\nThe shrill missed the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the the public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic on the left no\nRight to have really a a nervous breakdown\nIn public that is what\nLeft ism has become and you notice it here and this is we've had all these different examples you know you had real Rand Paul have is well rather ... wife wrote a letter about how not only was he attacked and ... almost beaten to death by a lunatic left wing or\nOr who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know neighbor dispute is Haiti Rand Paul attack and from the island was killed\nHe had pneumonia he was terrible pain and that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter credit shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria a Hodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter to maybe you should know the less likes to forget it very conveniently\nUm but you know his wife wrote about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats and\nProminent Democrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about\nThe attack on Rand Paul as though it's all how funny this is something cute that they should laugh about people are disgusted I keep\nSaying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost it can't be debate because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the law is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have not to begin with\nBut you know Brian kill me\nA guy that I I don't I don't know Brian I work in the before I I Know everybody in conservative media at least by reputation is not knowing them through work Muslim or personally I Know everybody British\nAnd Brian is universally considered a by everyone I've ever spoke to a really nice decent guy\nYou know whether you like his uh his owner persona or his analysis that that's a real\nHe's a nice guys just supposed to be a really good I don't know of only work them or the other people I could tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always been enjoyment or actually even if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass which is not the let's just say he was\nHe would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was shocked in ...\nRashed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know are there any other kind these\nDays activists comedians here's some of the audio from a play\nOn words you're accused of sexually harassing\nJust everyone is only a lot [noise]\nNot on the new law that Congress ...

are you know impervious to this kind of thing to think that that's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some a left wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy each different in the halls of the Senate it's different in a public space of public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference you waiting for a wedding for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside the home\nThat's weird there are boundaries here but this goes even beyond that\nBecause not only was there the the ambush interview component of this dinner was the following him into the subway so that's really you know you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car\nPublic we try to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard the prank you'll meet as a racist what if that person down and Brian space\nAnd would apply and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if a Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt that's not a hard thing to create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians\nOr creating a combustible situation they are creating a scenario in which you would not be difficult for there'd be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nThey don't mind that they're running that risk you start to think that maybe that's really what they're pushing for this is who the left has become they won't deny it they won't shut this down they won't call it out there are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and
