why Hillary lost\nGot it with a whole Russian meddling nonsense but now that they've convinced a lot of Americans that already won election was changed because of this this ... this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that difficult\nAnd you don't have to be successful right because they took all contacts out of the discussion there was no longer did they change votes did this actually shift the election and any particular state or or in any meaningful way or was this just\nThrowing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge how much impact that shift had but it did something\nSomething means that you can always say the election was tainted now Russia or China or Iran any country doesn't even have to be sophisticated they have the ability to with a minimum of any financial outlay with a minimum of of anything from there and they can\nAffect the outcome of an election right they they can

would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio it can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year\nRegularly that Hillary Clinton may run again and I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy\nI Know everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what I got my first time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top a Clinton aide Philippe Reines who is a veteran spokesmen and console yes\nThey are saying that yes it's a it's\nPossible here's resented political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversation or informal formal polling as they twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before this would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made in ...\nSixteen shocking to last up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt when asked about the like that ever running rains responded is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary wonder if I'm In telling all along\nThere's an entire apparatus of people around her who believed that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by the Russians I\nThey believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative is I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes it will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for her Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary but this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that the\nCase for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational in the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it\nThey just feel like they had to adjust show down a lot of nasty stuff in order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it\nAnd there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may\nHave to do it again and they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance to Hillary Clinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of\nTwenty five percent I'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's

confirming us based Saudi journalist ... is dead killed during an incident inside the southern consulate in Istanbul, Turkey according\n[noise]\nShe doesn't sound very well adjusted to me just putting that out there\nWhy why why someone who lives about his drinking and he didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much it's like way way too much such a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live about a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that you would drink too much sometimes\n... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop gap and it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in on this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz and an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there\nWell for a lot of reasons one is to just say them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nKnow it would never occur to me and I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they stand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me now\nI'm not saying to talk to somebody to gauge somebody and if he was elected represented ... but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation I'm sure you know this is not meant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted\nCruz they're mob and Ted Cruz this is what they do they like to foreign mobs\nAnd also reminded me when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there\nBut you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assaulted\nAnd that's if if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy but that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well\nIt it because something bad happened to me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced\nBy that that's that's crazy this\nIs just a it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a uh I I was on trial for a stealing right I was in ... for fraud\nAnd people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so she must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was a\nWidespread talking point the whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not this is really elementary stuff\nAnd that this was a something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become ah there\nThere is a a mass\nHysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that the king\nAh logically about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal the average age of the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to them other people here are their thoughts and because ... there's so much claiming a victim status now when everyone's saying oh I'm of victims do you have to listen to me\nAh their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification that becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality to bring this back to the Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's a lot of endorsing of it

that uh troubles her now because of the lack of consent 'cause you know he gets kids while she's asleep in a coma from the magic spell I didn't think people are trying to dig any of this uh literally\nUm but it turns out it turns out I may be wrong on that what it turns out that ah that there are people who take fairy tales literally um but if we're going to talking about celebrities
