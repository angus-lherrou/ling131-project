least till the camera Fox News that's what President Trump is saying as a caravan of migrants from Central America continues to make its way to the U.S southern border and the administration has a theory about who's funding it boxes Jessica Rosenthal has more live\nThis is this just preposterous it's just\nThis should be laughable when it's all they've got on the left and that's why Obama is out there on the campaign trail given speeches trying to trying to just tip the balance of the house to the to the Democrats and\nHe's the guy who's running there saying yeah that's right the good economies because of me to be before even let Obama make his case for himself which is to understand this if the economy were what they said it would be under Trump which was you know in a freefall recession bad things happening\nDo any of you believe for one second that their story would be well it's not Trump's fault it's Obama's economy\nOf course not just this is ridiculous\nSo given we can establish that we also know that we should not have to take it seriously that now they're saying oh that's right it's it's the\nIt's the Obama economy that we are all enjoying right now please please that is ridiculous um but here's Obama making that case like look too\nSo by the way we're right on insurance rate was falling\nPoverty was falling [noise] and that's what I ended up like that [noise] so\nTalk about economic miracles right now remember\nI mean this Obama at the at the economic level is the guy\nWho's you know who who's a who's white comes over to open up the ketchup bottle because he can't get it and then he goes you know I losing it for you it's like it does it really really cutting edge lot really\nHow this goes and I just think that that's so indicative of they got nothing right now they've got they've got to try to they've got to act like\nObama's still the president still the one making the decisions because the decision that I haven't made for two years are good\nAnd they're helpful and people have jobs and they have money and the more money in their pocket and they have less less of a crushing tax burden in the corporate tax rates now in line with the rest of the

hire corporate tax rate that you know Denmark does that mean that that's the kind of stuff that the Democrats\nEnded up having to say I I guess they feel like they really have no choice but Larry

depression the worst one and basically a hundred years\nThere were ... they never had three percent GDP gross under Obama's time and I'll never not once in eight years\nThat's coming out of a terrible recession in the stock market going to hit you know thirty forty or thirty percent I think it was the real downturn the Dow got crushed all that stuff could low is just the one is out there making the case played a clip three\nOn their heads storage shed the so called recovery was fired out two percent average per year which is really the worst since the I Believe Simpson depression\nAnd already we've beaten are critics including Obama staff people were on an economy that's three to four percent economic growth\nAnd the whole change here look\nPresident shop is cut tax rates on small

can't make the kind of Oregon because of the facts of the facts are what are we do they make oh they create an alternate universe where Obama is the one who's really responsible for the decisions that Trump is\nMaking record for the the benefits that Trump has brought about the economy you know it's it's Obama who's doing all this great stuff they are\nLiving in a fantasy what they they they they

into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked of circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully become immigrants in this country\nWow\nHow many new that then President Obama was so anti immigrant was so heartless what what about the women and children Obama what what what about them or they allowed to just come into the country and oh my gosh\nOh you mean that Democrats for for a long long time including through\nThe Obama years when he was president were willing to pretend that they don't really approve of illegal immigration because they know the American people don't approve of illegal immigration\n\nThat was Obama ... you could have he hears the quote quote we simply cannot allow people to pour into the U.S undetected undocumented unchecked\nAnd sorghum navigating the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently lawfully to become an interest\nIn this country from could say that tomorrow and they would scream that he's a racist in fact that sounds exactly what Trump would say it sounds exactly like what he would say would you yeah what about her trumpet so racist always so horrible how could you say such a thing\nThen they'll let us know principals or they're completely\nAbout immigration it changes depending on whatever they need at any moment in time\nWe used to think that we could at least have this core agreement on we should we have laws the law should be respected and there should be there should be legal immigration we should we should stop illegal immigration and people who will tell me over to Obama was deporting them\nPeople but he was deporting all these people do things to remember about that one President Obama visited we had these federal agencies change the definition of deportation to include people turned away at the border\nSo now if you were caught at the border and told to go back and you were you know you were arrested a release back on the other side\nYou are now considered to be deported that's one so that was a way of driving up the numbers and to\nObama deporting people was necessary to create the impression among the American people that he was about the rule of law that he was favorable to a secure border\nSo that then you could get through a massive amnesty for oh they say eleven million it's twenty million it was a brilliant plan\nYou know do do a little bit of enforcement let them call you the the deport or in chief and then build up the currency politically and with the media has helped to make it seem like you're serious about immigration reform when really all you're serious about his amnesty\nBecause with energy comes to death of the Republican Party full stop so whatever they have to do to get to that point there of course willing to do whatever you can do whatever you must do to get to amnesty you should do as a Democrat because it means that you effectively eliminate\nYour competition eliminate gone forever right victory game over\nWe cannot allow people to pour in the U.S undetected an undocumented unchecked and we can allow people to get around those who waited patiently in line that was Obama\nA few years back where are those Democrats now whereas Obama now other than telling\nFantasies or that he has about his his economic record do Democrats in his last ditch effort to try at least flip the house at least with the house Democrats are so they know the Senate on no chance and it's out of there out of their grass now\nUh put Obama's doing this whole this whole storyline about the economy and he's going to take credit for which is just not just nonsense I've been saying and it doesn't it doesn't comport with the facts but also an immigration there's such a fundamental dishonesty about this about how\nDemocrats would approach should approach this caravan what they expect Republicans to do and all of all\nThe arguments I hear from them or just emotional appeals there's really not a policy argument for them to make because they can't they won't tell you who can't stay\nWho has to go back other than criminals they certainly won't address the issue of whether or not secure borders doing to this country and how it's part of ruining communities with\nPut aside the ruthlessness the brutality and this is a mafia style hit this is straight out of the Sopranos right this is you know beat someone to death count up into pieces disposed the body\nAnd ... this is what do you expect from an organized crime family that is ruthless and violent and what we shouldn't be surprised at at recognizing that was that the Saudis are effectively in organized crime family they just have royal titles and a lot of money but they operate like an organized crime family\nAnd I just would know that is very likely that the Saudis have been doing this kind of thing\nFor a long time meaning there are a whole lot of body parts very down desert that we never get to hear about from people who were maybe critical of the regime or just pose a problem for the regime and Saudi and we have no idea we never will and even the people knowing Saudi won't say anything because they don't want to be buried in the desert somewhere\nWhy would the Saudis do this in such a clumsy way or their services really that\nIncompetent their intelligence service at the people that were involved in this hit\nAnd I don't have a great answer\nI mentioned you that sometimes in closed societies like Saudi Arabia where the services can operate without any fear of you know the Saudi ACLU getting involved or something or they can do whatever they want effectively if it's sanctioned by the regime they can tend to be a bit sloppy\nBut the Turks also have their own intelligence and police services that can do more or less what they want as long as they have the backing of the regime in this case the the air go on\nA government and the Saudis should've known that\nMeaning that the chances of them getting away with this we are so slim unless they were just dumb and really believe somehow this wouldn't be a problem there must have been a miscalculation here\nThat either we're not taking into account or that we're not yet aware of the latest reporting says that the body of the show\nAnd I was told is very early on but I didn't think it was ... well enough I might have mentioned this on radio I Can't remember now that the body of the show the main factor been buried in the garden of the head of the consulate consul general I think in in ... during his garden\nThat's what they decided to do with this guy\nWhich just goes to show you how how just brutal and rough this whole thing was in the\nThe reports that the the forensics expert Saudi forensic expert who had a bone saw who said to put on according to Turkish leaks foot on music because it makes the process easier in fish is grim\nThis is just brutal what the heck were the Saudis thinking\nOr the relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia certainly not going to feel the same for very long time\nAnd I'm not sure where the administration is going to stop this I think there may be some sanctions against individuals or there will be some replication of visas maybe they'll expel the Saudi ambassador but it's going to be hard for people to hang out with Mohammed bin Salman anytime soon and act like everything's just fine\nUm that's that's where this ... showed me thing for for the media for the left this is really just an ad like upset it's an opportunity to bash Trump and that's what they are fundamentally most concern with this is an opportunity to bash Trump because whatever he does will not be enough\nStructures they'd also spoke about the ah the caravan which I wanted to spend a moment we'll talk more about that and the next hours this caravan which I Do Democrats that are in tight house races and and Senate races really don't want this getting all the attention is getting 'cause it's a\nIt's a problem for the Democrats yeah the base is all about oh we just want to legal and bring people and and the more the merrier but\nThe majority of the American people do want our rules ought to be respected they do believe in sovereignty and pump ... spoke about the caravan today here's what he does say play twenty four\nThe migrant care caravan is violating Mexico's sovereignty flaws and immigration procedures\nPresident Trump will not stand for this to happen to the United states\nTo those who say say this is a hard hearted stamps let's not forget that the United states is a historical generalization when it comes to immigration [noise]\nFor one million people per year rented permanent legal status here in the United states over thirty three million people to total are currently here who've immigrated to this country illegally\nTo those who want to come here come here legally\nPretty straightforward isn't it and yet it almost sounds revolutionary coming from our own secretary of state come here legally stop trying to find ways to get around our system actually use and respect our system\nAnd these people keep saying that it's native fish and it's racist and all this to oppose masses\nOf people just walking literally just walking into our country because they want you\nDon't seem to take into account that we have had an enormous\nChange in debt in the region decade and the demographics of this country in favor of more and more and more immigrants all the time from everywhere from all over the world we taking we we we had a million people a year told\nThat they can stay in America forever legally in this country looting a large number of of citizens and as I've always said welcome to those who are citizens who come here legally\nAh but that's\nJust crazy for people to then say you know what\nWe just uh we just really think that America has this native his policy it and the caravan is is yet another time where we're seeing the truth of it all\nThat foreigners were bringing in more people than anybody else but we're doing nobody else is doing nobody else is taking this approach and every other country is allowed to have\nBorders why can't we have borders why doesn't sovereignty matters here why is it that that anyone should be able to come here and and then\nAccess our benefits remember the tax dollars that you pay my friends or

matter what I repeat the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstance\nAh now there's all this focus\nOn the caravan right now and and the uh the demographics of it who's in it you know they're the left will focus on the women and children that are in it but it was we know there are a lot of military age males there's a lot of young men that are part of this caravan\nUh the less will say that they're just seeking a better life and jobs but people in the right will say well hold on a second there is also going to be people with with gang ties in this tide who realized that getting into America is going to be a much more lucrative for their elusive practices and\nThere's always going to be people that you would assume once they get to the border are going to try to use this mask\nThat will strain any police resources use that moment you try to to try to bring drugs and other things over the board\nI mean that that's just we don't know but that's a reasonable expectation\nOf but ultimately for the left this is I think a losing issue I'm a losing issue because the point is not how many ah middle Easterners or non Hondurans there are\nThe point is that we don't know that we have no verification mechanism in place that we have no means of proving who is and who is not a part of this whole thing\nOh and by the time they get to the border and there are so many thousands of them it's going to be too late for us to have any realistic process in place that's assuming they make the border maybe this will dissipate although I doubt\nIt I doubt it but here is what a\nCNN was putting on for analysis on his last night get ready for it\nHit the deck CNN play sixty\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there but that doesn't mean that they're bad it doesn't mean that they're terrorists you know we were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow began to think of terrorists\nOf most of the terrorists that we as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people or by Muslims there being committed by right wing extremists in our own country but I just it's a lie on top of lie on top of live wrapped up in live and then was the last minute on top of it\nAnd I appreciate you trying to fact check it but I just don't I mean there are clearly you know people from other parts of the world who would try to come to the southern border there is no evidence of terrorists people with ... and ... according to the people who know\nOkay a couple things first of all many of you know I lose my mind I get very very agitated with is continued lie on the left that most terrorism in America is right wing okay I worked\nIn the ... instead of the CIA work man why PDAs intelligence division most terrorism comes when you're talking about terrorism of lethal concern and a strategic threat to the United states it is overwhelmingly\nIslamic radicals overwhelmingly Ninety five\nPercent plus when you look at mass casualty attacks in the United states involving a political motive of any kind\nIt is overwhelmingly jihad is\nRadical Muslims try to kill as many people in this country as possible\nAnd when you look at where we devote our counterterrorism resources and that means including how many disrupted mass casualty plots there have been how many people we are how many people we have to put out there with the FBI and CIA and everything I law enforcement all across the board\nAnd the amount of time and energy resources they spend trying to and then in fact stopping terrorist plots it's all jihadism basically\nAnything that's not jihadism is ... it's a shock to surprise so how they come up with this is just by changing the definition of one what constitutes terrorism All right and then and then to hoping that we move past things like oh you know nine eleven when we left not count that and the statistics\nAnd don't count disrupted plots and the resources that we spend a year in and year out on specifically Islamic radicalism but back to the point about other no middle Easterners\n... the reality here is that we don't know and that in itself is a problem meaning that you can't\nJust have people show up at the board none of these people have any documentation not that I'm aware of at least maybe someone brought up with them you know they're not showing up being able to prove it they're just going to show up and tell stories\nAnd they know what stories there's silence I have you know there's gang stuff going on and in my city is that is now in an asylum claim any person from a whole slew of Latin American countries that are just be set with violence\nAnd corruption and terrible stuff happening all the time they will all be in a position to claim asylum in this country and say\nHey you know one of the things I just got to know that people say oh very few of those last caravan which I Would note was organized by an international NGO\nSo don't don't get don't allow them to just play this game of old but you know people were saying it's organized it's such a lie well the last caravan which had a few hundred people was organized by international NGO so there was a an organizer that was not just a grassroots hey let's go do this\nThat's that's one point it was on the other is they'll say very few of those people were granted asylum what the leave out of that is very few of those people have actually gone in front of asylum judge\nAn immigration judge to find out if they can stay or not and very few of them will for a long time\nBecause of the backlog and everyone knows this this is a backdoor way to get in the country and everyone assumes that they will stay\nBecause we will not enforce the law that's where this comes down to do we have sovereignty do we have rule of law the left says no because it benefits the power structure\nAnd because ideologically people just want to feel like they're helping the poor and the downtrodden\nAnd they don't mind doing it at the expense of all other Americans and our rule of law\nIn the midst of all this whining coming from the last you have to wonder\nWhy would anyone acts like such a baby you know what maybe they just need a little bit more caffeine a little bit more delicious tasting coffee\nI don't know maybe the patriots in veterans of black rifle coffee could save this country from all the leftist tantrums if we can just get those screaming progressive to try some of our delicious brew

possibly going to be the first female at first African American governor of Georgia I it is a close a close race right now\nBut I think that was really telling that that ... that uh that clip we just played for you where she has an obvious hostility to the free market and I think has a very a very uh\nLet's just say superficial understanding of what the conservative argument is for the free market or let's start with this we have nothing even close to a free market in health care we have massive government regulation government intrusion redistribution of wealth the government\nIs already spending a large percentage of overall health care dollars urine and you're on this country because of Medicare and Medicaid\nWe we do not have a free market nothing even close to a free market so so let's start from that let's understand where we are and then look at what the problem with health care is the problem with health care as a as the left sees it is that not everybody just has\nThe problem with health care as the Wright sees\nIt is that in less you increase the incentives for there to be more caregivers and better care and more efficient care you can't actually\nPromise unlimited stuff to everyone and not either one in ... invoke massive rationing or to bankrupt the country or free both so we get on the reality based world of you can say everybody has health care\nAnd you can even mandate that everybody has health care but that doesn't mean that they're going to get taken care of when they are sick\nDemocrats keep pushing this notion they say well look at how it is and these other countries look at how it is and I and we pushed back and say well hold on we don't want the system that they have in the u._k.\nWe have a better healthcare system in this country and we also by the way I have a much better and more prosperous economy\nThan they do in the u._k.\nAnd we also have a much better and larger and more dynamic economy than the Canadians do you look at these other countries where they also have private health insurance that people with the money will get for what they really need and what's really important to them you know you want to have heart surgery\nBased on a national health service in the u._k. or you want to have a hearts or heart surgery at one of the best hospitals the United states you know the answer to that\nSo there there's no simple straightforward approach to this but let's just all be very clear that\nBeating up on the free market and sing the free market never wrote a prescription that's just rhetoric that's that's a whole lot of nothing that doesn't tell us how things are going to get any better and this is the part of the health care discussion the left does not want to talk to you about at all\nWhich is that a huge portion of our health care spending right now is pushed by lifestyle diseases it's pushed in large part by a choices people are making\nAnd if you don't have any cost sharing it all in that if you went to a single payer system then there'll be no incentive financially to try and make better health choices oh I Know people do but what about people at this terrible disease or that terrible because I Know that happens\nYou know what most health care cost comes down to heart disease diabetes old age that's where things in our old age obviously is not a choice but that's where the spending is that's where the money is going\nBut we're not we're not having trouble in our healthcare system because of people with you know can general birth defects or because they are born with some some lifelong chronic condition that that's actually not where the health care dollars are going\nSo coming up with modified means of giving care as well not forcing", "year": "2018",
