concede check this out I I ... in response to her\nCompletely insane statement on air which you get done after backed down from and apologize because it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing\nThat you will see or hear on CNN all week ... not even this week will that be the single most because we've got an election coming up next week ... people are going to try to out to one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other than Mr Don Lemon ... pie too\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or anyone ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who were marching you know tours of order like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them are tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border [noise] um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people comma and understand that white men on the right or the real threat there is a real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV\nAnd you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on this and come up no no no he is representative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side's a laugh the Democrats what they think\nThey really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric and the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi biggest Dina fold you know ... ... vehicles with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that is\nAt the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the ... the the the honesty to be able to understand\nThat you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights stack fires and Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know that you know what it really drives a lot of this is the success\nOr the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it\nOr that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they would be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president but you see\nWe have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things\nSuch as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black\nAnd Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton of investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to stand our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that\nThe powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end in what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for\nTwo years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about\nThe judgment of some of the most celebrated names in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts he's in a front\nTo the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if\nThey can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people\nVote Democrat it rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a\nIn a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up by right we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we\nTry to take a rational approach to it and and even a somewhat just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case I Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that is the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone\nNow we now we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it but the\nCalls for civility from Democrats for the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHave been in bad faith what they want\nIs for conservatives it for Trump and for the right to engage in\nSelf doubt and just stop fighting\nAnd there will be no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle when the right decides to stop pushing forward beliefs and what it thinks is correct and what is best for the country all you will have\nIs the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw for the eight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces\nIn it at every opportunity like this\nThe left under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outposts number bay and adding all the ...\nIt was rough\nThere was no good said there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow where do you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country in the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition\nSome would say our political enemies and take their advice for how we fight when we're winning I don't think so\nI don't think so\nAid for for nine hundred to eight to five you want to chat open up some lines you ate

taking my call like I Know you're going to get on the subject of this or birthright deal and if people are informed of the fourteen conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal birthright yep\nThat's coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held illegal aliens\nOr should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this age children of slaves\nWas important to the fourteenth amendment was well as for it was for yet that the descendants of of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but\nIt should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's wing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country ah yeah they always take a side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face\nAnd yeah he has every right to do that\nYeah I think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much Charlie for ... calling from Maryland Stephen in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Stephen\n... hey Prague and

they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I Wonder and wondering is on\nThe ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out being because one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in this country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is let the right to call and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically\nNew immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up a as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have and as a child who is a is is given citizenship either to a to a legal parents\nThen benefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a two year old

B.\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass shooters who are white males that were if anything political leftist but you know this is\nThis is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that\nThey will they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down do you say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of ... in this country um\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation or for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but are you hearing what you find out\nThey've never mass shootings but I'm an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about\nSome communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed um but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine or male\nSo as a river that we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat I'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of says Ninety nine percent of shooters are are male in this country\nThe country's also Seventy percent white\nSo if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and a country is Seventy percent white but only fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are not and why they're all the shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places I think they're really making about this I mean when I remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are still many are white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and and really pointless exercise uh but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOur ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity\nOr whether we agree with that or or not um then you get to the terrorism side as

among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is a very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count\nOn on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot end up with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... current and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously out only agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nA\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right subject to the jurisdiction\nThereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is you really subject to ...\nI mean you know this is where you started to get it okay well hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes\nWould you have to do and when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French ... a French French joy all French soil ah I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography\nAnd that's where this gets more that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already of where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not\nBe a citizen right in the case of the sons of adult us diplomats who were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship so that's\nA place where there's no clarity it off and the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long\nAnd for him when he's not running again that come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the G O P side I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul Ryan look is one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue\nBut that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism ... that's clearly not with Walter but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party dare I say and and that brings it back to how\nI don't accept this separation of party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party it's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is\nJoe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the Senate or other Joe Donnelly\nHere's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side\nAnd on the Senate side are state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy saying I mean\nCould you imagine if a Republican said I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well gosh cruiser my cigarette break\nUp a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't sound like much of a complement does it bread banks I think\nI mean granted you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like her\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get ... this is this is the Democrats the best and brightest bugs the Democrat Party\nSenator Joe and Joe Donnelly this was this is what the other side offers up for Republican did it that would probably be the end\n[noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security
