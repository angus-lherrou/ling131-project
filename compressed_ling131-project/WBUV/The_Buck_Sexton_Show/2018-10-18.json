we've been open borders state\nThe Democrats are planning to demagogue this issue they are going to use this\nTo try and get their base fired up or try to use this to create this sense of a moral

going to show up at the border will end up in danger of the United states [noise] ah they will be processed but if they claim asylum\nIf they turn themselves in a and they claim asylum they are going

actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is so very easy\nFor Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats\nWho don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining resources from over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact\nThey view it as nothing but win win\nBy being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country to Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps\nEven eventually defeat the Republican Party for ever by changing demographics of this country such that there'll be a majority of voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future at least who vote Democrat\nBecause they know that immigrants particularly the ... people wealth [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for them but who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general\nUh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of the government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers the it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up his problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the following actions no they want to point fingers and screamed racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody\nAnd they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional Ford them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and whoever respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have\nMS NBC CNN New York times the Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nThis is very very destructive\nAnd it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty if the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances then it's just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy\nWe will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes you cannot have open borders and the welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows says no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes the legal and God Bless them welcome to America legal citizens year in a year at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nIt's a lot every year working in a million through our legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand oh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing the kind of number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want to do because\nWal first off would prove its utility very quickly and then they don't look for what you're saying oh walls don't work no pretty sure walls work you\nKnow if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking on to their property in trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence\nThat you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia\nWorse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the president I'd states they wasted a year of our time on this year\nAnd a half of our times it's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talking about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border you should reunite\nThem but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's changed the way that they're going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours we're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again\nI'm not making that up people were saying that about this people that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which is\nIn itself just astonishing\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to understand that such the other side plays dirty what's at stake here the future of the Trump agenda and the trajectory of this country for at least the next two years really the next six\nGot a couple of weeks to figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to do it\nWe'll talk more about it right after this break [noise]\n\nThe

you know we were going to ... ... what does that mean\nThis is my favorite question to ask people what is what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are gonna put another way what what is the peril democracies in right now there's just like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this is just rhetoric\nIt's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\nWhere do we find these Democrats\nFor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there there are fascinating leftists there are people you can talk to you I I I Know people anarchist and I love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in\nAt least it's worth engaging you learn something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all

bad things up\nBut there's there's nothing that's even more listening to most of these people about Bernie Sanders has a kind of charm and a ... an authenticity that comes across 'cause you don't govern Brooklyn so I looked him 'cause he runs that people do know from Brooklyn and\n\nYou know you hear him talk about these things you say okay well that's not he sounds like he's well intentioned but then when you start to get the things like math you go well this isn't gonna work this is crazy\nSome really bad idea\nSame thing with all of them\nWhat is what is Kamala Harris stand for whatever the Democratic party tells you to stand for what is Cory Booker stand for same what does was with orange that for basically the same Bernie Sanders' same Joe Biden a number warm CNN poll recently

people\n'cause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans on the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of can age in terms of a bench\n\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic income I think they're actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all the news get people angry and telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators who are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate\nAnd max and with the Fox business report I'm calling\nBecause whether you're weren't Jeanette ... stay informed new\nTraffic and whether you talk going on for nine [noise]\nDo does the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump ism\nDo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate this president will not only be unchecked he will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing\nIs stoking hold civil war in this country ... million people use battered our eyes and in in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people he's the leader\nIn Ninety eight or nine\nAnd I send me sees political analysis such crash\nSee Schmidt is among the very worst we'll talk more about it he's going to get another appearance later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot on MSNBC though what he's saying is true by the way\nWhat he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of women's Ikle or something but it's not just trumpets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not treating it as old as only Trump on the ballot\nFirst of all every single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should you think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that\nOut but beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change the selection much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I I had a I had a chat with the Lindsey Graham flashlight spoken for about twenty minutes we sort of sat down we're over Fox I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game 'cause you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather a you're not the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging has healthcare help your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling shows that that actually for people who are going to vote\nThat matters Republicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the\nCabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not good\nI work um [noise] the dynamic as it's playing out right now\nIs the uh\nThe dynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in\nA elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue went speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up is going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call where it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any if any more authority now already have all the wives the American people a cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop just huge a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre scary is about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump has drawn but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think\nCould still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still happen\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh is critical [noise]\nI've got a couple of it in my hands right now my friend black

the number to where I Belong to sightseeing thirty two long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia [noise] that continue to be important kind of terrorism\nCustody of the two holy sites\nForty ... alliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount and just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of at our problem\nI Know that there's symbolism ear journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but he definitely had very real ties to America\nThis was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative\nTeam and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty here I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already\nBe an investigation as highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it but if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were\nBrought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak vice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip ten oh I can assure you\n[noise]\nTo lie\nThere will be consequences the vice president says noticed that people are pretty pretty thin on details\nOf what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here and what would happen from a major fracture\nIn the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis and the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring\nWith at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to\nElect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these things which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean\nAnd it's going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power\n[noise] let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi Arabia right now only do so with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had\nThe top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to uh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them\nIs because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenarios of the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan because you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin\nJordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not a picky wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems a new look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place\nDoesn't collapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government because it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around a one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them that Chinese people were the loudest voices on this do not have\nAmerica's interest necessarily at heart\nThey view this as an opportunity\nTo both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been telling you this is supposed to really just turned ... turn into a means of getting at Trump and saying that no matter what happens it's his fault will get into that in a moment\nDoor of the social media is full of lots and lots of
