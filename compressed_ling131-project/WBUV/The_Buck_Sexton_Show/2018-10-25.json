they think they have an opening to whack a finger at the other side over instability which remember wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be maybe\nOne wacko who is sending what increasingly looks like yard bombs to very very prominent Democrats and leftists and\nThey want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not doing which just goes to show you\nHow much gas lighting goes on in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of as we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all of this just how delusional they really are\nBut I didn't want to spend a moment you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs in fact I could have an assist here from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions like with a please\n... apartment is responding\nTo the suspicious packages that have been sent to several political leaders and a media outlet and then ask last few days yesterday I spoke with FBI Director Chris Wray and\nAnd deputy director they vow to it and we met with in brief the president to bring him up today FBI ATF are working on this for a profit ministry ration weaken them the actions that led onto a these acts these activities and the strongest\nPossible terms on terms into determined to make sure that we get to the bottom of it and justice is done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a fully informed decision us being the American people you and I already know this\nDoesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump\nFor the Republican Party or anything else this has nothing to do black safety threat\nThis is one very very stupid and ah and agree just an evil jerk\nI wanted to use another word but we're on radio um who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison it's just a question of how soon we put him through that process\nBut the judge bombs that have been found so far that could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances there was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the YPG is going to have\nTo say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\nThe odds and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know it's a dog and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or\nThe NYPD can't take that risk not yet I Can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think that is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but\nThen again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have\nTended to get buck slapped rather hard here's what I see if you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh\nWhich was toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh give buckle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left activists when the Democratic party loves the story a but the people in places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world's getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really for doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears ... hat and and loves Trump's so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threatened people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever\nAm I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging for the Democrats and in the process make the anti Trump media seem sympathetic\nAnd give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nI'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black\nAnswers obviously yes so that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I refused to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for\nThis that's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly\nThey have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or in the week you said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement and that's why things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious\nSo would one individual change that dynamic you know we will hold\nOur final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime I'm leaving open all reasonable options and some that the Democrats want to shut down or a long way from deserving that\nGot a jam packed showed ... not just the bombs that I by the way so uh I I Want you to be sure you stick around we'll talk about Megan Kelly ousted from NBC or what that tells us about the culture right now by the way I don't really\nHave

to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane\nAnd I'm so I'm going to say this I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept her she'll tie yes we did we held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending capital and we hear in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House emails trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move\nAnd this could did this will mean that the OJ now has the ability to pull records you know they they might be able to see some communication's perhaps between sweating ache and other people but you know this ...\nYou want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her to lie they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't but then again she changed her\nTestimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious fix my that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention okay this really is too much\nThis person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's\nWhere I think we are now but if they\nThey're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweat neck faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie I think about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat the Duke lacrosse team raped her it was a complete fabrication a total lie she claimed the guy was raping or who was miles away in an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend seven to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed\nAt the political whims of the left for their convenience than people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished the left is going to kick scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it\nNow will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating it as a liar absolutely\nAbsolutely I as I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone's spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's got a poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire punishable that everyone drinks yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she's range I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie the story will be she's not sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coughing she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley\nPushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this and we'll see how far they're able to be able to take it I think that this could end very\nVery poorly for ... and sweat Nick and all of the leftists who are really complicit in this lie to destroy Kavanaugh\n[noise]\n\nEverybody has ... and
