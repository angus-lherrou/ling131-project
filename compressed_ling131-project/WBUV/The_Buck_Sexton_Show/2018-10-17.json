was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one\nA and released this information to it is believed buzzfeed news\nAnd bust be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nI'm so quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards alleged that she leaked materials that led to

means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve law breaking but here's somebody who\nForty year old woman thought that she would leak this information\nThe press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now now probably her life along with it because it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it explicitly to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone\nWho was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff since ... on on anybody\nThis isn't even intelligence world stuff is there there could be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash and the bank you know maybe you ought to

lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed\nBy this so you have to wonder how many other\nFederal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration was there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a

verify\nBut this idea that because Trump calls Jim Acosta clown which I Would note that oh you know Obama used the trash Fox News ... network that provided anything of a voice of opposition at all\nObama used the trash Fox News on a on a on a regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it and you know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his opinion about uh media apparatus that is entirely against it\nBecause of that I'm\n... years somehow complicit in the murder of his journalist journalists have been oppressed\nAnd detained and murdered in foreign countries for as long as they're journalists isn't new\nBut this is all the anything bad that happens in the world is Trump's fall to the left anything bad happens anywhere in the world of any consequences you can say it's Trump's fault if their sexism somewhere it's comfortable it there's racism somewhere at Trump's fault ... whatever it took ... dictators desperate stressful\nThey get past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as commander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was the Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the hands of the hottest I mean that's what happened\nSo we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do this but it's just so typical isn't it it's just so standard operating procedure from the left and I got I\nGot to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got to ask them and say you know\nHold on a second um what do you say doctor gee I'd like to um to jeeze good guy\nWhen he's not going to feed the people that are always talking about Trump Brazil cozy with dictators you just look at the actions look at what he does I mean you know Trump has his way of trying to immigration him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense the standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know super aggressively to everybody and he needs to hold to the calendar is just nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings uprooting that Kim Jong un these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nOr you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the president because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that\nHey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the less now is infused with this anti Trump rage\nOh you know they are really they cause those\nAnti father should be anti trust anti Trump she'd I did their city while while\nI I Am so sick of all the grandstanding on this on this ... issue and I also think that people are really over selling overestimating how much of this is our fault in our problem how much of this is something that we really need to take the lead and didn't why did they think we're going to do\nI I'm not about to say yeah let's send in the eighties that can airborne you know or a hundred and first airborne whoever I let's send them in and you know and until the Saudis turned over to the crown prince you know we're just going to\nSit on their you know sit on their soil I Know this isn't saying we're not going to do anything like that right so what are we going to do it's a foreign head of state we're not going to prosecute him okay we'll cut awesome arms sales oh that's going to stop them but I Hope that they don't send minute you will see we've got more coming up\nYou're interacting online all

about the enthusiasm the blue wave but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm\nAnd I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail [noise]\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think it was not same interview that that is really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's\nCyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nOr anything in this country or say oh there's ... there's no inflation is very low um hey Powell my thing\nIs that because the fed is ranging range just too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him out I'm not happy with what he's doing because\nTotally too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers are very\nLow this is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even with the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water and that's a very gentle way I think\nOf saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans\nVery very high uh we're more indebted now that when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper or deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now\nBe impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all of its rhetoric but they like that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional\nAnd willing to take action about all this\nAnd with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt struck a crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018",
