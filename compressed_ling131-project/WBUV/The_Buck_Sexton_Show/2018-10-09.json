thirty days in power or thousands of your rights when comparing the geo Peter ...\nSerious people don't do this intelligent people don't say this without feeling deeply embarrassed at least\nBut the left us\nFeel embarrassed they are licking their wounds this week I think that conservatives under the circumstances have been\nA quite generous and how we have responded now that we finally achieved justice and yes it is justice for judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court\nOh we recognize that there are other things to turn our focus do we recognize that there are other ways to spend our time and attention\nI was very pleased that last night President Trump did take a moment to apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the White House at a ceremony play a clip one\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire having a family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or a lump [noise] last fall is be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nThe presumption of innocence a has been something that is under assault here from the very beginning I mean the presumption of innocence was going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process\nAnd sure enough it was saved at the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle\nIt could have gone the other way\nAnd Democrats would have had no problem in fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way wouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process\nDespite all of that Kavanaugh is bending over backwards doing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be a fair and dare I say judicious judge\nThat he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of\nDecades of public service you know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made partner\nHe'd be making easily a few million dollars a year right now easily instead he's a bit in a federal judge DC circuit court of appeal to me probably makes out of every now and less than two hundred grand\nSomething like that which you could say well bug he's still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he couldn't be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary\nAnd understands it that's a very important role in very important service and they don't want to look at his record though as a judge\nWhere he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of this field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was some the gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick\nKevin ... was the guy who\nWas doing what he could in order to at least be impartial as a judge should be whenever he hears cases and they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys family destroys reputation\nThat there is no more room for anyone who\nCalls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives take their arguments more seriously play more fair with them feel a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nIn ... finally recognize that what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done that they can no longer\nShame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act\nLike a bunch of savages we have to push forward and we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that that said\nKavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing to try and heal the country and so in so much as possible forums liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides that the judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution [noise] the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an idle\nWe do not caucus in separate rooms for Supreme Court as a team of nine and I will always be a team player on the team of non [noise] I was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court he was with the majority opinion or almost all the time other judge is looking at the law\nAgree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interpret the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much but there is an underlying truth here and that is that the country is a better place with more respect\nFor the rules were there will be more respect for the rule of law where every American\nWill have his rights more respected under the constitution because ... Rao judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because of the justice Kavanaugh liberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it\nBecause they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or\nThey want somebody who will tell them yes\nThe constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't\nAt least Kavanaugh will say I may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes in public life for a whole bunch of reasons but this is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us and with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ed I'm not going to give you the decision that I think I should based upon\nWhat I Want to give you a decision based on what is the law vicious where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ on the Supreme Court on the constitution and what all this\nMeans Scalia school is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with flag burning\nYou know but that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law was like I don't I don't like flag burning but you you should not be made illegal you know you look at some of these\nDecisions from very concerned conservatives will protect the rights of liberal even on issues that they feel very passionately\nAbout and that they do not because it's about principle right they they do not agree with the end policy\nProgressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did\nRuth Bader Ginsburg and Kagan and sort of ... and it said or did you did they give us the semi divine rich from these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they judge Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem with cats and all but we have entered a a very interesting period right now\nPost Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms I don't know if the Democrats psyche can really handle but the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party can really handle what it means\nThere are in Michael is going to get very near to where we are in fact in county as a dangerous and life threatening major hurricane if you don't follow the warnings from these officials destroying peculiar\nTo store now making its way through the Gulf\nWhen will this be making landfall we're talking about a land for probably around tomorrow morning at least beginning to see those early conditions tomorrow morning or perhaps am but landfall itself may be closer to lunch and that's when it begins to weaken but there's still a little bit of indecision with this current track\nAs we follow anywhere here off towards the eastern edge of it maybe Appalachia cola or farther off to the western edge of this cultural Panama City that's where a lot of these models are taking the stocks\nMeteorologist Adams clots reaction from lawmakers to the resignation of the bastard Nikki Haley\nDirty leader Mitch McConnell addressed US ambassador Haley a short time ago [noise]\nOr turn it will be remembered for her proud real version of America moral leadership [noise]\nFederal fearless willing enough to return a bright spotlight\nOn critical ... from Israel sovereignty to around ... original ...\nAnd this from Senate Foreign relations chairman Bob Corker saying quote Nikki Haley has been a fierce advocate for U.S interests during her time as you want to Vassar while I hated to hear her departure I've enjoyed working with her and I'm thankful for her willingness to serve Fox\nIs like Emmanuel the capital of the president and Haley announced she would be leaving at the end of the he or she had told him months ago for plans to leave but he knows that was made public today Wall Street at the ... stock sending the day in the red down last fifty six that act that added to yes in the last four\nFish is Fox News [noise]\n\nThis is talk went on for now I I knew operation\nIn California to crack down on illegal guns\nCalifornia's attorney general in the LA county sheriff say they're using a database called the armed and prohibited persons system to take guns away from people who shouldn't have them I joined the operation which ends in December has successfully closed more than two hundred and twenty cases already sheriff Jim McDonnell explains why some of these particular people shouldn't have had weapons\nA hundred and eight cases involving criminal history or prohibited firearm possession sixty two cases involving psychological or psychiatric restrictions\nSince the databases created in twenty Thirteen attorney general ...

discussed here on the show in recent weeks for example what the what they're teaching in schools now in some of these departments in women's studies women and gender studies we called the wax\nAt Amherst College where I went I took a ... class\nThat was interesting uh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to get how critical\nOf of the Islamic faith the women's engender studies professors ruined to be the answer is not really at all somehow\nAre treated better according to this class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought you know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical\nAnd serve it just means that you know you like celebrating the fourth of July and have read the constitution at it and it ... and it matters to you\nI'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who ... who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and that makes you in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservative according to the left\nFor college was certainly a process radicalization from it that way but the grieving studies departments\nAre churning out millions\nOf young people who really think that they\nHave something where someone to blame for all of their frustrations in shortcomings in life that there's there's some reason\nSome reason that is not of their own making a lot of their own doing that their life is disappointing that they're not as successful or not as respected or not is loved or whatever the problem may be and it has nothing to do with either\nOne part of growing up I found very important one part of the wisdom of age is just understanding that

I mean I'm here in DC I live in New York ... this is this is not the Taliban version of American women walk around dressing however the water as they will should\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world and and there's something\nInherently that feels a little\nUh unjust about claiming publicly and this way\nAnd it's not just the singers are this is this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures that we don't care about these issues that is a slur that is a slender just not true\nWhy did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is\nWhat was included in some of those surveys or so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things make liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion first fat free zone\nAnd Kavanaugh's whole situation has been a combination of that with all the news\nAbout recent online security breaches it's hard not to worry where my data goes making online purchase were simply accessing my email could put private information at risk\nYou know your being cracked online by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing\nHistory they often sell that history to other corporations and those corporations profit from your information that's why I decided to take my privacy back by using express vps\nExpress VPN protects you what it costs them less than seven dollars a month\nFrom all of this fracking and nonsensical on the background would ever use a computer if you ever used public life I Want the Packers in spies from seeing your data expressed VPN as a solution protect your online activity today find out how you can get three months free ... express VPN dot com slash book\nThat's expressing VPN not\nOvernight what's new today on the free our radio\nFor decorating the house for just setting our pumpkins spicy platelets has killed tracks with labor inspiring when no after de\nBlanc mixture you break out all our great failure party ... whether you're at home or the stadium and knew I our Radio Free ... collection that come out now\nShot at one thousand dollars\nOut of the nation wide one or two hundred days from five AM doing via a thousand dollars every hour no\nOne thousand dollars now\nTax the key word bank two hundred two hundred and you'll get a tax confirming ... radio in the\nState or data and Mrs rates apply that bank to two hundred and see what\nYou talk going on for nine W ...\nFrom the men don't view it GMC studios his talk going on for nine points and I urge radio station [noise]\nBracing for landfall ...

so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be establishment approved\nAnd so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my God what does this mean and as I said I don't think I mean very much at all I think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh I was gonna say pumped I\nI don't think bump pale would've been secretary of state and another minister ration but he's a former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I think compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party cars but I Know but still\nUh\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and and and Haley and the others in his cabinet who are thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump using is increasingly\nI've always thought it was a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so\nWhy also they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh Nikki Haley's up because there's thought in the GOP that Nikki Haley is is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee\nNow let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six answers now you got no idea I Am I\nAbsolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do just come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation spill filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou'll you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation as easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on the Spitzer oh I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nI'll be honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she is necessarily I'm quite as a compelling a Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh that she was a a a gender traitor\nWhich I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um but I I think that uh\nYou know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelfth\n[noise] how come the end of the airlines ... is that we make sure that everything is white and a half an hour to come and in fact in ... and the United states and I'm proud and part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm\nWhere I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when I got an hour or six years and we got like a hurricane found in your ... sitting bull hitting a lot and then to\nHave an ironic ... it's been eight years have intact and I'm a believer in her mind I think you have to be like for not you know when you found in someone else to do the job\n\nThat there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact\nDidn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the administration that's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or stories and that and if if there is all certainly that you know but for now it is what it is Nikki Haley's hadn't out\nDoesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's my analysis of it I Know all book no what do you do it uh but I Do want to spend a little time with you on the\nMidterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and\nCreating permanent stability and then I Would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in a war zones and overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream his on his back hills but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset that is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the less going into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment [noise]\n\nHow does one never miss a customer again when customers
