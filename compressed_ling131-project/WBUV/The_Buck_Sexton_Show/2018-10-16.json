I thought he was going to be a strong leader instead he's ... and let letting these people letting these autocrats letting these tyrant\nKilling journalist and the light of day here we are\nAll the sanctity moaning and blather complete blather\nFrom these two pompous overpaid over coughed clowns MSNBC they don't know a damn thing about what they're talking about oh what\nBecause ... dad was secretary of state I'm supposed to listen to what she has to say\nI don't think so I\nWasn't a good secretary of state for what that's worth was actually pretty terrible at it but discussion for another time\nAnd Joe ... when I say whose team is he on I Know the answer is on Joe's team\nIt's oh it's all about Joe it's all about Scarborough himself he doesn't represent any ideology doesn't represent a set of principles he doesn't even represent being a journalist use just they're just spout off and make sure he's Harris swooped up as high as possible you know come down with the swooping the rock band Joe it's a little weird\nAnd you can tell they're trying to make this personal they're trying to they're trying to personally goad the president of the United states on this issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks what what message is he going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would so dramatically changed their minds that would\nAll of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing is going what are we really going to do this is not a U.S citizen this was knocked down on us soil the Saudis let's write this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on\nThe soil of another country in a conflict is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do disgusting ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new\nWhy is this our problem I keep hearing about how what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do\nWhat could you do and why is it on him\nShouldn't as we don't we have a United Nations for exactly this purpose don't we have the international community that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted action\nYou show up but they won't do anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day\nBut when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it comes from from all nations United together or what about this issue well no that's not wait for the United community of nations to come together let let's have the u._s.\nDo what I have\nTo say ... the the\nFrenzy the frenzy that the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story in the country\nAnd just skip over what's\nGoing on with us troops for example in Afghanistan of place we're still at which we are still in war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want to they they don't talk about that anymore or\nThey want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because\nThey do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalist and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy tapper would say you know a damn ideas\nSaying that that you are really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nA new talk talk talk talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined not a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first amendment though right not not much of that you hear that about Trump all the time because he\nTweets because he tweets\nIt is a this journalist to show the what happened to them we still don't really know and we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts or this case they're still trying to figure it out\nBut everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the price of the United states the leader of the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that\nWhat they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or disgrace none other than\nChief national security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes take this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is sending is it there is no consequences for what you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role the United states [noise] the whole people like this to a cat\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not ... if we're not standing up for this there's not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are journalists everywhere are less safe\nAnd and let's face it we have a president fitness center also they may say so for a values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nThat's the trend line that I think it's getting much worse\nThat is a giant pile of crap a giant pile of crap from Obama's chief national security propagandist a guy who laughed about creating an echo chamber of idiot\nAlmost entirely Democrat journalist during the Obama years to sell the Iran deal lasted they're ignorance in their stupidity at least on that he was right they do have a lot of idiot journalist at these media outlets especially the young ones were right out of college who have just bought into this left this nonsense\nHook line and sinker but ... noticed how far this goes in and this is trumped arrangements syndrome on the world stage\nAte a Saudi hit team kills a Saudi journalist in a consulate in Turkey and it's\nIt's on Trump to make this right it's on us to make this right let me tell you something as someone who has spent more time than he ever thought he would\nIn war zones alongside men and women who were wearing the uniform to defend his country and you essentially rebuild other people's countries for them I don't think we have to make everyone else's problems are problems all the time\nRubble the local police working off a list largely they have exhausted that list pending that can notification they may be done with it but you still have passports number two out here it's working the map and they keep finding more people boxes\nLike Calvin and Mexico beach the FBI searching for a Wisconsin teen who's been missing since her parents

I've accuweather is Bryan May\n[noise] this is from Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly man I Want to solve one oh four nine WB is the\n\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nAs a president said we're going to get to the bottom of [noise]\nWe need to know who was responsible way due to all those\nBut it was a member of a free and independent press any loss of life is grieving any acts of violence planes alive [noise]\nUh [noise] this was also\nAssault on ... so\nTo demand answers world deserves answers\nSay that those responsible are held to account\nNow that's the vice president who's saying pretty much all\nThe things you would expect him to say I think he's saying the right things here on this issue\nUm but the left is critics of the regime\nOf the administration sorry that happens sometimes they're not placate or by this at all they're not okay they don't say All right you know because Penn says we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not there are slowing down all they want to jump all over\nThat their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can\nAnd they're not waiting for anything they don't wait for the fact that when a wait to see what action he takes day just prefer this notion that you know\nTrump is a bad guy that helps them sleeping I one of the things I I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion that this is an attack\nOn an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an ...\nPress at all not not even a little bit okay there there is not an independent press and sort of your people say oh buckets been getting a little better than reads yeah whatever\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press beer freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all\nKinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared lots of countries and even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe ... some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on you know hate crime legislation and all all kinds of stuff in Britain there's no oh you can ... you can print national security secrets because you're the press they had the official secrets act last year but they don't care if it's a matter of public importance they'll just lock you up\nSo I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath and understand that yes this is that\nYes the u._s. should send a strong message but it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to the history of mankind we need just take a step back here and understand that people die all over the world under terrible circumstances everyday doesn't mean you ignore at all but it just means that you need perspective here\nAnd what we're going to do even if we find out that the Saudis are as culpable as is as has been alleged from the very beginning meeting all the way up at the top\nMaybe will not sell them some munitions was ever going to sell them maybe we'll send them a a strong reprimand under we have no legal authority to do anything about this we are not signatories the United states is not a signatory to the international criminal court so we can't go there\nAnd we're not certain for for good reason which is that the notion of an international criminal law doesn't really exist I mean yeah there's war crimes I guess but try and forcing knows unless you've already beaten the country\nAnd brought them just admission that you want to punish people and because of their war crimes and it's just it's really easy to the bank the tough guy drum on this issue it's it's a lot harder to sit back and actually come up with constructive ways to deal with all this\nYou know it's really easy to say oh you know I'm I'm all about a free press in Trump isn't doing enough or what should we do I'm not just saying oh we can't bring to show the back because we can't\nBut he's not he's not an American why does this fall on us why does it fall on us just wonder you know wondering why that is and I think it's because they see they view\n... what is the purpose of all this\nIf lives are just going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she oh typically here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrats socialist year as we know ... and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrat socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state\nThat doesn't work the Math Doesn't add up and also people\nAre willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union there is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say where\nYou want to you know I I Want to help Americans first\nIf we're going to have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans all races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck and we're going to have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that surely that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh the jobs here are\nBetter well guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're gonna put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country never let me back and it was going to feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders not only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way all of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants\nWere they think that we owe them something\nWe owed them not just citizenship not just permanent residency but also all the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything even America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you Trump for showing us that\nGrowth under Obama for all the people are saying well I'm a ... show great growth under Obama and his last year in office was like one point something\nPercent growth under Trump second year in office GDP over four percent\n\nSingle best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country so that will be Obama's corn and we will do the please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made a slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet for any length of time not somebody who had to run a business of any kind\nYou know he was in the business of Obama it's different [noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in the way up the leftist narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them in and we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want\nAnyone is allowed to show up in this country\nAnd we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all of us require for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loop holes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all have to say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country I saw it was supposed to be for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nOr because we're we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's rock supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world\nAnd that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way they understand a they understand that quite honestly\nThere is no way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say all of a second I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that have been in this country for centuries now or join this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented joined the ranks of the aggrieved undocumented\nAnd try to get them access to the public treasury as fast as possible\nWe are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually\nMaking our economy stronger that is why\nIt's an obvious lie if if Americans are not\nBalancing the budget at the end of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going through a member of talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so I Know you know this to manage it frustrating it is frustrating that you're going to hear so much just going to turn into one big media sob story to oh who would\nDrawing these people who would turn these people away\nHow could you so heartless you know the Republicans with your your top hats and you're Monica stepping over poor people in the way to work [noise] it's crazy [noise]\nAh we will talk about lives with Warren [noise]
