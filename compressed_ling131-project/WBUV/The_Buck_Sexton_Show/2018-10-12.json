Fox news Andrew Brunson\nThe American pastor held in Turkey on terrorism charges fried earlier today heading back to the U.S that a meeting with President Trump boxes Jessica Rosenthal has more live\nTelevised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are manifesting themselves with these mad a masters\nIn these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality and on and the really the lack of ability on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize\nTrump is winning\nHe still winning they haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations and his finances I'm In New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand each\nWord essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in the seventies\nI think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep\nAnd it was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this just kind of like the scene and John Nash the John Nash hasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on all this stuff all the formulas in the wall and you and then you realize oh this person has a problem\nThe media has a problem\nTrump maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberals say that and it they really going to all of a sudden you know just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election certainly is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick with that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president did they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you know you'll hear on the left the worst of all time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he was doing a really good shop the economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that even though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan what are called irrational\nExuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying that it should get worse last Eighteen months and it has it so what do they help themselves what did they come away with\nAnd this then brings me to the outrage mobs\nAnti fall and the uh you know the the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh for than the these stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers\nWho are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away at a Republican who put a block slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nBig high five\nThis is increasingly looking like the last is gonna have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals\nFrom doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of ...\n... I mean the last must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we could at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month what does that mean for the left how did they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know this will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of that nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole call some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nThat they have a successful midterm election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America\nPeriod they never or reflective on the situation in an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and in this crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage mobs or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are\nAn opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump but that's only part of the story the other part of it is that they are now inflicted\nWith self doubt they won't talk about it they won't share it with you but how could they not be this was the man they said was incapable of leading incapable of running the federal government and capable of being a successful president\nAnd he is blowing away the critics right now\nThat's got to be a strange place for them to be\nThere obviously not adjusting well to it there have been sore losers from the start but now I I think that Trump is living rent free in their heads in a way that ... it's just going to get worse for them and I don't know where it goes but if they if\nThey don't take at least the house and I'm ... I'm telling you that because of what I was Cavanaugh I'm starting to feel like maybe we could pull out of surprise you eat in the you know the pollsters over at a you know five twenty eight or five thirty eight or whatever it's called now they're saying about twenty five or thirty percent chance of Republicans\nHold a house that's not enough and I think it's a little higher than that too but we shall see aid for for a nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks we have a ...\nShow here in the free them up right up my my buddy ... joined it talking about just what the top of mind with him in this week in politics you've also got Dr Sebastian\nGorka I wanted to get a whole bunch of my uh my favorite guests and on the line here as we got ... joining a we also have soccer and Jedi really really a great up and coming a political reporter he's the White House reporter the Daily Caller who's going to be shedding some light on the whole Kanye phenomenon this week and\nA lot of things I Want to hear from you ate for for nine hundred bucks we'll be right back [noise]\n\nHave you ever find yourself when sing at the weak sauce taste of some comic coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brands you probably wish they spent less time on their politics and more time on their coffee\nLeave that President Trump said North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson was in the air this afternoon that he'll likely stopping Germany before coming back to the U.

Papadopoulos Alex vendors won\nNone of these people had anything to do with Russia collusion and yet we sit here\nAnd wait for this final report to give us the ... the ... and state outcome of this ... what a mess what a total mess I mean I can say this to bring us back to what we're discussing earlier in the hour\nUnder any normal circumstances of the American electorate judging this president on the merits of his presidency and therefore the party he leads the Republican Party by how things are going and basing their votes upon that\nBy any objective criteria that we can point to the country is better off now than it was a couple of years ago\nTrump is a more effective commander in chief then Obama was the economy is growing more rapidly and has more more head re more room to grow even further because of what has been done because of the tax cut the deregulation\nAnd yet what has been the focus this whole time that that it's not the Democrats have been making these Ernest appeals about how they were better run the economy all they do is try to tear down they just play the politics of the attack dog all the time\nThey don't offer a creative solutions I don't what they offer you as more constant nonsense about the Mueller probe what they offer is a it continued national conversation on whether or not you know there's something in Trump's tax returns from Fifteen Years ago that would be\nSo bad they really have nothing and that's what\nAnalysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you had a lot of analysts talking about this one did the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy ... obviously ... by it because they\nSaying you know why the president and detracting away from his great we with Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally attuned to know that you know more Americans saw that clip with Connie eight and anything else at the end of the day you know if you were to go around\nAnd at at somebody like universal studios like they used to duty on on ... on late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West up from the president's\nPerspective he's using the star power of Kanye in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a I have a hilarious moment\nIn the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on their face and they were just\nSaying this was wild one of the camera guy told me and the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter] that's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet or what are we expecting tonight that Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the G O P hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who\nIs running because people have actually told me that for other campaign that\nOne of the things they love about when the president comes as you get national TV coverage you know when does that last time that age you know some house candidate in uh Ohio six\nIs going to be getting in a ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea they were he he's been having a saint campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night\nHe's got one tonight he's got one tomorrow night you've had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about his record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies that is that is absolutely the case of ... what are we what are we expecting by the way I'm On the policy side for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that if anything we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate that last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said\nUh you know in terms of on reduction that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nKnew effort president about that right I mean you ask them about their reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I ... a week before you did I think and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the\nIssue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that in the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the midterms\nSo for now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general horror with ... he is is very uh\nVery cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time\nIn order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent being the White House all day soccer\nThe best part is just be able to see I mean it can be they're up front to to to get yelled at by it rock\nLike we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleague we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked him Mr Iraq which I thought it was funny to all of this rock and is it mature rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump's you fire Jeff Sessions he said he should fire all of you before [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as a as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um\nYou know act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of a prominent let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's it's like that's it day to day stuff that oh if Jim Brown is here kid rock is here ah you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dreams\nWould be able to do and then at the other on the other hand you also get to talk to the president the United states and you get the asking questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt's got to be the most on President in all history to get to have a conversation with I mean I Know you are the only recently out the over ... recently ... it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\n[laughter] yeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you you'll throw something out there and he'll latch onto it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty in another direction and you you try and flipping Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what a gift\nAnd that that really is exactly how you say it it's it's\nWe we love to tell you know and the press it it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer\nOf ... it's it's hilarious I think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him and said have you talk to the Saudis about you know the current situation with this is missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yes [laughter]\nWell you know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just starts going into all of the the discussion there is the most\nYou know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in person\nThe ones that give me one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you are the White House correspondents that bucks accent as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the octagon the Victor [laughter]\nOkay yeah all spread that where it's definitely not going to be be terrible but I oh okay I have a few ... that we can put up against\nYou you you sell your Daily Caller ping pong champions that that the ping pong champion up the hill dot com wants to piece alright you spread the word [laughter] All right All right I meant saga good work as always have a great weekend we'll talk to you soon thanks for having me buck jak outsiders latest Daily Caller dot com team could break we'll be right back\n[noise] have seen one of the things that make the show so special is the exchange of information\nThat we have day
