...\nFrom the men do viewing GMC studios his talk going on for nine point and I urge radio station\nWhat made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the Republican Party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beat none of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman delivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the\nPeople that the um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby way ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged\nBrilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response so after all of the theater this week after all the circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic finish\nSo bravo to you GOP bravo to you and to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today\nI'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for a\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTalked to guys last night I found the or your books from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and\nI don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a book\nOr we call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who\nSaid he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called a stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's\nGo all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really interested we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember\nWhat sparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the date when that happened\nChris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nA Chris Matthews was on the air talking about\nRevenge and\nI tell you all of this\nAll of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it said\nWhen you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge\nThey tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court\nPick from President Trump\nSays this time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't drink the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews\nIf you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss\nAh I'll I'll tell you to talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today\nThey sounded like a bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity it's an absolute attorney\nSo I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who want to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens\nWhen you get the house and the Senate and the president say in the very next election the midterms history tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you I Know the other day I asked to\nA question about what the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum\nAnger at

to\nPresident Trump in his speeches that these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being

Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nBut I Would argue that I think they're equally famous match slap welcome to the buck sex than shows her\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShoot a great job should rich have look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and\nI was telling her I feel your article beer and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer I Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the raiders were very emotional and that but very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go for it not just for the party not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America's legal system I think would have taken one in the guy\nHad we not gone forward and I know we're not done yet I Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a feta ... and not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every ... ball thrown at us in this process or I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a partisan on the conservative side as or you might put the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so eight filth and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the same\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family\nI think those folks have to find\nA way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I ... that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election\nAnd I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm go go we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country still the same thing that the Republican Party kids have to keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of share that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant and Fox News you know they give him a big hug and I've been a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never truckers and if come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promises they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional as a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans\nAnd Trump supporters and\nConservatives most of that coalition or or conservative I think that there's great promise now more problems than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap a I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC Matt\nUh if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute you're I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he deserves credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that is ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee tickets shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rough just wait till you get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up ... millers autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mole that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo uh I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nYou'll have like five daughters you and mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters have vastly right\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all feel silver lined by the ah by the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah you know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really like to peak deal\nBut you know you got to fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought that was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty\nHe's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to what the character assassination he fought back he fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized in the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with this politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way like it's just editorial\n[laughter] that would ever believe that they want but we talk about the need\nIn a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's a really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver\nAnd also that it's not the first arrow you pull out every time you know and I think having a showed us that he waited until he had to go there and then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time\nAnd I thought today how did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be a celebratory dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only mine but of this show and the the conservatism everywhere\nTanks Mike you're a good man and I have to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips God keep us going the right way thank you bat [laughter] we'll see you soon\nTheir egos match lap or if you've never been to sea pac\nWhich happens every year in the spring it's even in a non presidential election year\nIt is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and if you have a young person who's looking at politics and interested in politics especially from a conservative point of view it's really important that you get them involved because their training\nAnd a good information there was well All right\nI'm rambling on when we get back let's talk more about today I'll give you more Susan Collins will look into Chicago when what happened I'm worried about my old hometown and if you have a thought\nTo confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins and Jeff Flake along with Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nWhat we're looking at right now is a confirmation vote is either going to be fifty one forty nine\nTo forty nine the question is whether or not Republican Steve Gaines Montana will be there now he indicated yesterday that he would come back to Washington\nHis daughter is getting married in Montana and his vote was necessary he would come back into town and they might keep the vote open that doesn't seem to be the case so right now at a minimum wage probably going to be fifty one to forty nine with Collins and mansion voting yes if dangerous not present it would be fifty five zero to forty nine boxes\nTrip program on Capitol Hill secretary of
