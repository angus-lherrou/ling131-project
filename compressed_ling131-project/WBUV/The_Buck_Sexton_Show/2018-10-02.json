I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I I have a sworn declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch it might have spiked it\nI don't know if any do saw or how many of you saw the Jewish wedding interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony just a second woman didn't testify just give us warns name but the rumors allegation\nBut hold that thought for a moment\nSweat Nick is the one who says the Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweated also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's I don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be a mistake and I think she's a very troubled woman I think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may\nShe makes clear by telling us that she's got her she she just happened to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think she was issues completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said and as I've told you hear I Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people going to prison I with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and ... might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life\nHere's just a part of the kind of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate will the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady story and say you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all of these leftist females who are coming forward\nAt a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons ... where we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation\n'cause a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity hand in the balance hang in the balance and a a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nWhat he said well I'll tell what happened what will happen to me I didn't put ten and I gather\nThat I have boys outside and rose congregated together so like I dont lead [noise]\nAnd I think what was it ... ... ... a lot of laughing I'm forming in line outside or anything or wind that definitely huddled by door I didn't understand what it could possibly do that\nAnd the ... anyone to get their way here watching out number\nIn our whole and farm outside that door\nOne thing that I Would say from ... to have [noise] I Would say [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental\nSo I think we had something pop in the middle the audio that we we've got we've crossed wires there for a second but\nYou heard sweat next talking let's not look at what she says I don't know trying to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because he's just a liar I I can tell you what you lying about she's saying that she thinks that there were gang raped her she's making the allegation that there were gang rapes going all these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together as you ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere's nothing about what she says it makes it as a game if she claims that she was raped ... I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks rape her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nDoesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this point I don't believe she never even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete and utter I Know this is a fabrication now\nDoes she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense she went from saying in this interview\nThat Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of that means but that means everybody's getting really drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this stuff you know is adding a little adding a little boost to it to make it a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't route the the big bowl of punch cars that means you be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls and everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that you know that's a bad idea so her story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication that that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did that that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated and she can't keep it straight\nShe claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties now now they do I went to a a Catholic school a private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and\nNot really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of capital she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being ... feet and raped gang raped\nThey call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be much stronger position to take action or would feel much stronger position socially when the party of no Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with them this is the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying in an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster\nAnyone is still believes this really turned into an intelligence test because you can't just say oh no emotionally I'm really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say two thoughts on this number\nWe got so much more to the Senate Democrats are they're scrambling to keep this whole thing a lot because they know they know now they've mortgage all their credibility all their decency them acted like total gum to try to stop gap and all they know this\nI Wonder if they don't manage to stop him and they look like even bigger clowns in the process now they've expose themselves but so early we got a few days left who knows what they've got up their sleeves when you have no dignity or under protect you gotta lotta options that's what the Democrats a lot of options\nBattle wears on I'm Lisa ... socks news Democrats and

court and I believe that by virtue of\nLack of temperament and fitness for office was demonstrated so rapidly\nIn that last year and when he threatened\nAnd came to us full of rip van arrogance and

that in fact they will be on the side of my college\nSo I Hope is just beyond the\nVicious porous and rancor that he was going on the on\nThe accusations we don't lose by of what good moral moment is

oh they weren't just calling him a gang rape is a few days ago so I Need the Democrats to explain this to be sure cabinet and not be on the court because of the allegations of rape\nOr she cannot be

he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been ham so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some room mate or doesn't like look you can find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever the trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college there's they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're a conservative everybody\nLoves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\n\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression and that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concern and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch\nReflect you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person in the cabinet was above gang rape so that was that there's any evidence for any of this because there is no weapons\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there is the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about the developments we found out overnight elite Donald with the ... and ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations and for its really are about how it is\nSo that is very relevant and trail\nOf himself as actively choir boy or is there much contradicted by is his ... for example in college as long as people who knew him and I still why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from line for like ... ...\n... what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center Verona was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation the capital because you might have thrown ice in someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago thirty five years ago\nWho can say that and not feel like a moron\nReally don't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she said she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being our ...\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and you know it was a ... bravo and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our two\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four whenever it was no that's not serious near times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day and in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh you know he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes\nHim because of the threat that he poses to civil rights and women's rights I'm sure to of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nBook by creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open the storyline you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that flake takes the position of oh well\nWe should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's going to end up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yeah I still receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really\nFrom people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know big big big publishing house\nThat's that's what flakes game last year or so that's why I I'm concerned I don't\nKnow how the votes will go I'm not\nI have zero confidence in the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right [noise] well one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it as it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it\nDid I I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a\nStatement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man are there things in there essentially telling you that sweating it gives a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's\nThe bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have to be\nSalted before you believe women dish is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're eight eight collective\nVersion of justice or a collective is to approach to justice that's at the heart of all I Want to address that when we come back and then we'll talk about the\nLeader Chuck Schumer says senator should hear directly from the FBI first we need to be briefed\nBy the

could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate him out and not in the house\nRepublican wave ... isn't that interesting\nRepublican wave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty sixteen the GOP in the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election I don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up and be mad\nMad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on there like we are to show up and vote\nPeople that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo to figure out things are good things will stay good well what are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can have these people in charge you can't do it\n\nTo stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that\nIt could go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day\nSenate and this is where everyone starts saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics Bob well Jill it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundits is not telling the same thing as people keep asking me I mean I certainly hope they're probably going to win but and you know at the Republicans do it it's not like I think the world is going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nA way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem with the Democrats left they get show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I'm\nWrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me or you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the geo peas in a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job suburb it's not not\nBeyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening and that that's one point I wanted to make here and in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact I it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that this will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has\nTo be said and that means preventing Democrats and taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight\nThat's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they are going to agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers of Kavanaugh gets in the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital's a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it have Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and metal decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find sign that we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all
