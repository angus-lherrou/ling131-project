Brett Kavanaugh their goal post ... after\nSo You're welcome to weigh on in on this end anytime and joining the conversation now today\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things in our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows meaning meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over at CBS that nobody watches and Jake Tapper\nYou can kind of get an idea\nWhat the talking points are from both sides of the pile\nAnd yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primary Fisher case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that statement saying what a weasel the Democratic side of the Iowa has turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh\nAnd if you watched the Sunday talk shows\nI was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press ever but I don't know if anybody\nYou get the joke yesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen\nNo nobody\nWell it wasn't on last week because uh the Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it\nSo that's why was the single greatest episode ever but the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v weight\nAnd then after the meetings\nWith judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not going to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v wait until they they shifted gears and then suddenly\nAt the end of the hearing process they came up with is accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford and then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw block\nOn Thursday we ran into each other to book party for a friend of ours I was in D.C to cover the uh the hearing and the protests\nAnd then last week when it look like despite all the obstruction than deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left\nThat judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew everybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to\nComplain that week was not enough\nThey started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends\nListen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice he has the wrong temperament\nThis is being said by virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and are bringing it up\nAnd you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into that so now when after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you call the yelling\nYou're ignorant\nAnd let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh east too robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now playing the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dead she'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the crazy hysterical\nWill get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the buck family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking in this evening Solomon welcome to the buck section and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad you're there helping out a move the country forward\nOh God Bless you thank

a ... from three and a half decades ago so why\nWould anyone want even go through this is Lindsey Graham said doesn't make any sense\nShow me any teenager young guy college guys is very normal you know to be attracted to girls may be remiss construed the drinking playing around\nI mean more to more normal and say like you know rumors about ... people like that are going on private aircraft and with children and things like that\nWhether it's true or not you know we'll probably never know\nWe will never know but let's just hope judge Kavanaugh gets a approved and then pass through to the Supreme Court thank you rich and New Jersey appreciate your quick check in in Memphis, Tennessee with Randy Randy welcome to the bucks sex than show how are you\nHey good so\nAh Randy you're a guy who says I got a scary movie it's scarier than neither the living dead\nI've got a couple of ... is just because I thought when I was probably four or five years old premature very All right and all and probably nobody's heard of that one\nWell rain will land for those that don't know it was one of the ... greatest actors in America\nAnd at the end of his career he made a lot of B movies including a one with Rosie Greer retired football player\nWhere ... head got transplanted onto Roosevelt careers body and it's one of the cheesiest horror films you'll ever see\nIf you if you haven't seen it yet I'll look a premature burial but you look up I think it's called the thing with two heads and its Roosevelt Greer and Raymond land and remote land also made a movie\nCalled the man with the X ray eyes which is another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it\nAs I was only on my left because I saw it as a child but I guess my real one is a\nFantastic good ones and I yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I I still go for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes\nA\nGood good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks or listen to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got the just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know gets out and votes\nAre checking in I have time it gets to check in with John in Delaware has the thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware and when I'm listening to you I like that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover where you at northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I enjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived in Delaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservatives I'm up in the blue\nPart of the best thing I\nDo that but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it ... role but there's a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot at the shining is currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind\nYou guys I I just now started the show believe it or not I'm On the AM radio and and the ... that show just started about ... minutes ago Rob ...\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought the show just started ... you\nKnow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is ethic\nIt it well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic characters shift you have to like the guy first he was weird from\nDid actually he came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically stable and it's sad semi correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but I asked John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer because I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin Hood saw into wearing what he said today about uh the judge dairy said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying and is there any as a candidate notice judge from a carrot a\nChuck Schumer has got a big mouth and if we don't get our little boat and we don't you know get out there for the midterms there late things right\nAnd keep things the way they are if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're going to have you here his mouth for the next God only knows how long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are ...\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the hat\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy this man and suddenly this nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that I still didn't get to my network proclamation my my liberal network proclamation I Will get to it I promise\nPlus I Want to hear from you guys on your scariest movies are just around the corner in a
