least have fidelity to the law\nWhere were you honor requests from Donald Trump's ice agents they if they provided the pain or requests will you honor it is governor or you work with Donald Trump proceed with your time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when somebody of Germany but I'm probably the curator I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they are convicted maybe they start ten years\nWhen it comes time to come out there is it the pain or requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options Andrew will not answer the question that failed her me let me would be willing to release center like new\nHe won't answer the question that was Gillum and dissent is a dissent is was the one who is pushing them on that issue\nBoth candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say there is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really\nUh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee\nAnother person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about\nAbout Gillum and it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer he wants to raise taxes will be will say that\nAsk them how do you pay for this a bunch of things and you know we'll find some ways but just that this was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained requests and noticed have Gillum would not answer\nBecause what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do nots and now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered to or do not on her\nEyes to ... what that means is when someone is already in custody of law enforcement and immigration and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody day Sunday detain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse sanctuary city jurisdictions refused to do that and what to send his nose and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes are violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these chain of requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested uh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be shown will we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realized that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up and the federal Web\nAnd so there are ... and just the FBI is viewed as illegitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the NYPD and told his division I would sit in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSit in with an FBI agents DEA ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies were all singing to gather because stuffed them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we work together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut winter center there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is causing problems for the law in multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWhat Gillum is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from the left and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nAll about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when now that just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board\nSmiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob Mendez months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch a Kim great to have you back it's great to be here\nAll right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] [noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that ... the entire media is felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz's it's not like pulling away from work and the races even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez wet\nYou mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather modest by his colleague back earlier this year I'm after she had been found to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on the government an all time\nI'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry the department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat changed the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob you get in the Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving a favor\nHow did you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people to be able to Tom and I said okay well what is it and then there's there's nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nWhether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and there does open a Bush has got to go on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi that are actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point how they ultimately go after Republican corruption Trump and all sorts and butter issues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for\nBut in the meantime they just close their eyes in some cases actually are outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why I call the called smiling corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats just decided to reroute million dollars to help Bob and that does in his race on night they're taking away from even more important races for them or whether they're trying to unseat\nOn and places where Trump one I'm ... so much trouble in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I guess they're all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the Senate is on record saying that he engaged in corruption but\nWe're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving and one of them is on this or is on the notion of corruption as much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but you have so many Democrats you start thinking of all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last\nFour or five years for incredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone started telling me about the Mali months calls get them you know that that tends to be what I hear about a\n... but also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are journalists on something else but I'm pretty close to journal led\nA but most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to pay it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nThere definitely nothing written in any formal or informal rules at our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm ... ... ... per se I say why he have a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nBut you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best and then conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a prediction and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which is why hearing what mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent a they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down by the one way or the other right on whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us rascal everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns also her book the intimidation game Jim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\nAnd\nYeah I I think he was spot on there with the it's gonna be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around age there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chases people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nAnybody that shows up at a Trump rally in words demographer hat you've got all kinds of nonsense going

C. and they really think that there's actual they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nThe initiative and she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the sleeves again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads\nAnd then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where they could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that the fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who's battling literally vowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was an as an opinion writer for now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as it happened to him but the way they're talking about him it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean ... an American conservative Lebanon attacked somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nAbout this just the fact it is just they if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered him but you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the coast Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIt's like you're trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't\nDeny disappear alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of him leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside\nBecause they were going to try and say that he left in the day had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nAnd let me give you a little bit of in jail\nAgency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is right regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and they get very adapted dealing\nWith that threat but they also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey and that may have been miscalculation here they thought that they\nCould get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there's also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work so a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making the editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the shadow ban
