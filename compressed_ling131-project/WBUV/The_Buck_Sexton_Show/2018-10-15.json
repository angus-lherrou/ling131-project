like\nBy the way by the media that's for a feverishly fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming I could be one more to the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with it keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right or she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and or many would say the bong\nNative American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe where the quote vast majority of warns family tree is European is it says that she has a date of American ancestry code in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nAnd the Boston Globe initially did the math wrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here and this was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because this was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will\nThis wasn't a some surprise that a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected to the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position\nThat this would bolster her claim I don't know which is worse here\nUh that Elizabeth Warren is show delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it as to think that this will stop continued mockery of her for racial fraud I mean the hill where I work\nIn response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil\nIs it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago and since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than\nAverage inner connection to the Native American population meaning you enemy listened as if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have been white an American\nIs likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are here we\nAre she she must have thought that this was going to uh give her some degree\nOf of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago there's no realistic way there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis\nAnd you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all kinda hazy in nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of orange DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford\nA really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration he quote\nConcluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on an ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um this folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if a live rabbit Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even\nMatter if you call yourself Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by their standard disease\nCompletely nuts it's just completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to force this incredible\nUh on for stare on on her part\nIs just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top\nFour or five of early support from the Democrats for running for\nPresident and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as big CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place um and and when you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is\nAmazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter] I mean she's\nShe's like one one thousand Native American may be and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border into the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes and yet people in the media are saying sushi proved it Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up\nNow what what\nAre they got desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has to go even further and they have to\nSomehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove things that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but well what else are they going to do I mean this is\nA this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips is bonkers and on this notion even that that she has any Native American\nAncestry let me just give you this is from this pose\nA this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison\nThis is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases to make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis use samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia just stand in for Native American\nThat's because scientists believe that the

Trump isn't a you know accepting her DNA results or something\nThese people are insane they really are I I ... or they're ... it's just impossible for them to be a and embarrassed here's another eat another version Huffington Post Trump denies this is their top story about this\nTrump denies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump sad and was it was very specific Trump said that if she makes it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee and then and then she proves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars for favorite charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you Bruce Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because if she Native American everybody's\nNative American and anyone who's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this from the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth here would automatically understand I vicious just\nPathetic it is absolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually cover is the right word because they're really covering for Warren\nAnd this is because they think happened today is uh that would they thing happened today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe's a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares\nThat's their headline that the headline to see this is a perfect\nCase of media

lead them\n\n\nAntifa are you guys ever antifa right I used to be a big thing I used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about them but left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some\nAudio and we play for you of the the latest and the incidence out on the uh\nI don't do it as well as Trump Trump's antifa is better than mine do for a but I don't do it as well she does\nOut on the west coast in Portland\nWhich strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much\nPolitical extremism but but that's I I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there um but and you got these people with with the cheaper group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I forget exactly even what the\nWhat the group was called um let me do a quick refresher on that one but you are you sure enough you had\nYou had this uh this violent\nIncident where your protesters in and counter protesters your ego bears spray and bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march in Portland\nYou have to be very careful my French when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention\nBecause there's a lot of a political hedging that goes on there is a lot of usage of kind of weasel words and what they believe in what they take out of these descriptions for example\nJust because the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot ... I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and has a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I have no idea there too many of these little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry peace deal you Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a\nA a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist any any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive fundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases\nIn any group that has to pay a multimillion dollar settlement too much it was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want\nJake with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations in and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it but then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle\nThey want to fight people and the fact that they showed up with their spray and there's other things tells you all that you need to know uh but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not cover this this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you would think they'd want to tell you have a almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot prayer group over there they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order\nI I've got a I've got to wonder is is that just say is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened\nFor example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of approach is just like showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems well maybe it's because they showed up in the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nYou've got an a gay man they gauge it you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and from being a Nazi and they wanna they wanna hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date anti has put a limit on the degree of their violence where they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something lethal action against them but they have engaged in violent action\nAnd keep in mind that violent action if you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly\nAnd all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past when it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of her that just because ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists to remind me a lot of anti foot\nOr the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean did did this sort of when I'm In real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they're the ones who are assassinating presidents tried to blow up the stock exchange that's right who was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on\nA friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this this group that the Proud Boys\nAnd I've never really understood\n... who they are or what what they are I I I've heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McInnis and ask\nThe metropolitan Republican club invited the Proud Boys\nAre which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this uh in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who are just there to have a discussion I I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and you show up at one of their events\nAre are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that

long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own purposes to to create this narrative of you know portray us as the the greatest military mind of his generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low by the extra mile fair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work was not working and\nWas never going to work and he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all this credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation Afghanistan I understand that he's not ... was not this uh men beyond reproach when I came to his ... certainly not beyond approach period but also when it came to the strategy\nSo that's my that's my thing I Need to do a little more\nI Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to comment Democrat\nI also they've kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat as kind of a a little sly uh yeah\n... ... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say in my in my media life my guys okay it's\nKind of a communist so Trump says it's kind of a Democrat he also says you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is\nThis falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about\nA so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute given what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans\nWho are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump but all we know that there's somebody right now who wrote if you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we are working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president\nAnd to go to these if you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody as White House of course it would be silly to do that and that's also why I I give him more leeway than I Would of and other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's convenient not self justifying\nBut I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if you're a Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you talk about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpet anymore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me anything it was really\nSome of them you know I'm telling you to me it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade\nOf you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to\nBuild this report and then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to\nViolate off the record it would make them look even better you know the like off the record I volunteered at a soup\nKitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building like is that really did that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so\nI guess so ah and then\nYou know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview or had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position or since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that still the same thing they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but now it's the law and I don't think\nThat they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a net or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is\nTo find a way to adjust a law that it's a bad law or\nTo repeal it entirely\nIt really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration\nFor him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox an editor what I'm Sorry\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be\nWell it's just about enforcement is not just about enforcement when you're doing it for something at all it's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted\nBy Congress and I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would\nUh they would be in a place where Trump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be a they would be just crushed because of what I've been going on at the border and I think\nThat they miscalculated that for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that you know immigrants or do jobs or whatever the legal now folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing\nBut a net positive for the economy and they would like to have some\nRe establishment of the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has been build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff\nThat remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house but\nAll this on this issue of the border you can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nHappened under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when Obama was in office and oh by the way the people that are getting separated from the children at the border were overwhelmingly
