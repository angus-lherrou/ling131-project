do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors ... what people say things there's no evidence there is no there's nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the left\nCan control now impeachment is in fact a\nParallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they're gearing up for so whenever we tried to have the argument that Trump was not found\nGuilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office\nOf ... which is essentially whatever the house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office\nBut the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be that President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the racism\nAnd massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's\nYou know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's massage us or not and just oh he's a T don't vote for him he's ...\nWhich is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development and his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work\nUh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday that his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify\n... define ... what does that get pi him take away is pie\nDefying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition the lawyer Joshua leddy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not\nSatisfying the first and fifth amendments of the constitution ah\nNow I understand that this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair to fit as a procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that was absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe\nTo become public well when that the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here you never see a greater revelation amount of information\nFrom this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things\nIt's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tier and smeared they're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I I\nI just would note that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there we're going to do more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow worked for me for Iraqi right before the election so it won't be till after the election and we get more information but the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and you lose the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but\nI Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues the hill and breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I am holding out hope that Trump declassify those Pfizer documents on the investigation origin documents that that I think he should do before the election because in my opinion\nThat could be a game changer\nIf you've ever found yourself when sing at the weak sauce taste of coffee from one of those left

getting two thousand dollars that's a lot of money that people\nI think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump as I've said many times because he is so far a successful president\nMeaning that that they they hate him even more\nThat it is clear that he's actually up to the task or they they can say as much as they want about oh a drop it's one or two at the moment we

Trump or types who have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people\nWho come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and their of their system in of the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within his bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the ...\nFor for June presidents are ... advisory wars were ... you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and\nYou know you get these guys do the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better than somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector in the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this and I and I'm really aware of but now that I'm In the swamp in DC they really\nDon't like that this president is able to do this because he's not
