the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway so I made up word there let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very nasty things very um two rockets or things and then they all immediately jumped you it Trump's fault\nIt's Trump's fault that this clearly disturbed very yes dangerous and and and evil but added pathetic human being\nOr decided to send these these homemade there were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy I knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but there's really no

calling for essentially rabble rousing she wants people to get up and face you she wants to you know do you yell and scream and be nasty and mean and you know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this is why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we know that this guy is a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with his complete you know look he's he's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to know the need to be serious consequences for this well you really know that this guy is also I mean is it there's something sad about someone who\nWould show show deranged empathetic and an evil\nAnd and just the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being\nBut now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative of a broader sense but on the right meanwhile do we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his\nA wave uses his politics\nUm but now that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and it was like Nineteen Ninety three you'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get to this whole discussion and I wanted to discuss it with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're never going to hear\nYeah and you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always have to point out well\nThe big issue there is one you exclude nine eleven from it ah that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this\nWhat is the determining factor whether something is kind of his terrorism because with some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know a neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ...\nWell if the guy was a minority they'll say terrorists now is that a hate crime is murder yes is it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nA little bit less obvious less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism or and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nAnd from the statistics forwarded attacks I mean the moment that you start looking at worded attacks and you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat to\nYou know you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them a column I mean these are attacks would've killed hundreds of people\nMost of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most the right when jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous\nEvil or crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level national threat terrorism the way the radical Islamic terrorism is\nBut I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy a who's been captured today\nThis is a says our fellow cities are are said Iraq was what I keep forgetting is how to save his last name I mean everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying ah everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump Betty such a bad guy or say ... say opposites Iraq say or\nWhat is is a we know what is\nIt is not I mean is American but what what is that his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any news his first name is ... are the kind of unusual anyway\n[noise] ah\nYeah they're gonna they're gonna run with this though and this is what we have to deal with now this is not going away anytime soon it's a unfortunately going to be used against us and [noise]\nI don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it does in so I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but ... you're gonna see floods ... zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid week and change\nBecause they want this to be first and foremost on the minds of as many voters as possible and and they're going to be they're going to be really pushing this and they really want people to think that this is this is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when\nThere's going to be crazy people have all kinds from all places but they're [noise]\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count and more

Fox News the hunt began and the New York area and ended a thousand miles away in South Florida the suspect in a series of mail bombs fifty six year old says are say in custody authorities say he has a history of financial problems and a record of past rats including one for making a bomb threat\nYou know a charismatic presentation and a compelling personal story and all of a sudden you know fancy degrees and other things but ultimately Obama things that society is broken up between those who have stuff\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have either in or outside of government in order to make sure that they keep the stuff that they have stuff and the other people don't\nAh that sounds very that has a Marxist twang right that sounds like it's very much about the redistribution of wealth\nAnd I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself he's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful\nThat's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats and v envy push that pushed that notion it's it's powerful politics\nAnd accused the other side of being cynical ... what is it that republic because Republicans want to give a little less of their own money to the government there being greedy\n... this is a a an essential talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires go they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of time\nBecause overall I'm In the top one percent paste I think thirty percent of all federal income taxes so there we already have a very progressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about\nYou know ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to you wherever it is wherever it is every speech he gives same basic theme there are the other guys don't want the government should have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff\nHe creates this perception that prosperity and security\nAnd all these things that people strive for and society that did zero some one side has it the other side doesn't\nMean what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is you know why why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list and these are people that have amassed incredible fortunes\nAll Democrats why are they all Democrats\nYou know what what I find to be the case that people people that have had to work\nIncredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle to make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative\nPeople that when the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who get really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being with the temp guy in the door and now there are options are worth a billion dollars and\nThey tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it\nIf you had to sweat it out risk many night's sleep or you know do your own taxes take out your own trash\nA cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nOr concerts I just\nThat's the only way I could explain the difference in the economic philosophy here a little Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful and the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also keep talking about the economy play that play Seventeen\nWe're\nPeriod and Republicans had been\nFor the rich [noise] they've been cutting rules\n[noise] and\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats\n[noise] going\n\n[noise]\nOh why did it start with Obama how how about\nWe've had even we had an even bigger financial pull back with a Great Depression and we recovered from that and went and entered a period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point\nDoes he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years into the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow Obama ... reminder by the way Obama never achieved a three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never only president in history for whom that's the case so when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous that what he's saying is\nIs transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government was the
