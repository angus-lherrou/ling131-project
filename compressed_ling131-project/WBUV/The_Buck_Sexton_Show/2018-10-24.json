D walkers through everything we know\nAbout these bombs I had a little bit of bomb training myself back in the day and the CIA so ... will also dealing with terrorism investigations which often involve\nA bombs in IDs\nSo we'll walk through that component of it but but the overwhelming focus of the media is already are going to be about assigning blame and ah and settling scores you're quite honestly and and making sure that there is a maximum political impact\nAt either you just heard that statement from President Trump he says there's no place for political violence in this country and Jeff Zucker\nOver CNN CNN's one of the places where they had this suspicious package and they did all their coverage today from outside of\nAnd uh you know Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this ... ... ... you know President Trump had already\nSo what are the audio that I played for you of you know there's no place for for political violence in American society none or threats not and that's the president says here's how the president of CNN response quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House\nAbout the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter though so far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's\nWords that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace\nAnd there's no shortage of this rhetoric\nComing from people now they they view this\nAs a means of getting even with Trump now you know and they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing\nManiacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both are now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus\nAnd all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this all the\nWay up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done and you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of\nYou know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I I Do not remember any of them\nSaying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that\nA Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic actually shot Steve ... and he almost died\nAnd tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their\n... they've been calling the president and the United states oh trader or Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member and they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions\nSomeone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it\nNobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting it's illegal it's immoral and it's\nIf you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side might have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and and evil and stupid on every level\nBut it's the Democrats who have been trying to blow these lines for the last six months or so and it's the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\n\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe the front of the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war if you believe those things\nThen taking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been pushing back on Trump\nFor tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same vigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now and now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened\nAnd this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened Jeff Zucker\nNow I can sit here and\nSay without any feelings of of ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stand CNN is a\nDishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that age furthering division in this country that lies about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like a pasta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans in the president maybe they're actually going to criticize you back with words with words they're allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I can also sit here and say I I'm happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt that I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't\nI Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us\nAnd hope that we're okay you can't condemn these bombs being sent to us but also\nContinue to criticize us no I I can and will and it's not just CNN it's all these other ... you know it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive\nIncredibly destructive programs for freedom in for liberty an ad America I mean he he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff\nUm\nAnd then when you add it you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas and the Clintons of people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I Do\nRespect the Clintons but I mean I you know I I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respected that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that\nMatter but not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's the hottest to figure out what's going on\nAt without it being used right away in the most obvious fashion to score political points but I'm just going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually then ensure they win the house and maybe stop a a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's what they're using this as\nA monster and they brought this on themselves I'm not saying that this is a false like let's say any of that I'm just saying they're leveraging this for political purposes right away\nRelease of those packages to CNN billionaire George Soros earlier this week and one address to the Clintons and ... had local state and federal law enforcement scrambling to confirm or debunked those threats New York governor Andrew Cuomo who also got a package that was later cleared said those behind this have a clear intent what\nThey are trying to do is scare us and destabilize us and we will not allow that to happen the\nObamas and California congresswoman Maxine Waters were also targets in a release the FBI put this investigation at the highest priority we\nGot on President Trump condemned the sending the packages\nEgregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as American\nAdding in these times we have to unifying come together and Santa one very clear message that accident political violence have no place in the United states of America\nBut CNN president Jeff Zucker issue when it gets David waiting in part there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand that words matter\nPolice in Jefferson town Kentucky outside ... say to people have died and the shooting at a Kroger grocery store the suspect is in

Page I've talked to Papadopoulos talk he's got this whole thing is we're he'd kill us about Russia collusion it's insane\nAnd what does Russia collusion really at its core what does it all about Trump

objections to a bomb or that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level actually don't have any personal beef with Obama like\nI didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I look at a bomb I sing you know that's that seems admirable but I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed at night thinking\nAll that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump\nAnd now because some maniac somewhere we don't even know why yet but somebody somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle maybe here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day it's liquid for\nI'm Sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story again and says we're going to get food eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid clear officially and parents and in fact ...\nPresident from tries to play to his base with outright false if\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's handled putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non white people to fall white crowd to make a clown a lot of the president's than sets\nNot true things have been a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health Oxitec sales why\nThis is a an an article of faith now in the lead you have to say this all the time when\nEver asked them what what's the lie what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that winds up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I could recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nNot oh he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario\nAnd never get tired of it either oh my gosh you know the left in the media they they find endless ways to reach a Lebanon the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage miracles his brother\nI Know I I just get frustrated with that too it's it's so tiresome and they're\nAll their calls for civility right they're they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these\nA prominent leftists their calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again\nThey like the old order where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game\nThey're not saying let's all be good to each other they defend them up in the restaurants we'll talk more about that later they defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control everyone there favorable to this stuff\n\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down\nAfter Eighteen months of propaganda diving to their base of the president's a trader a sexist a rapist or a you know a racist a everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist say the stuff they said about President Trump and it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life\nIt is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close now they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously if people are these people are really in need of reality check 'em really\nAnd you got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here\nI don't know Joe Scarborough never met him dumped we care to a but this is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know if he's a member of the media\nAnd he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not human Mika\nA now because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage ranch and first to him today is on Christ like I mean this is here's what's ... play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame\nThat we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic [noise] not only the most basic American concept [noise]\nAh we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church [noise]\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read in some Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a side in the Bible to criticized Trump I mean this guy has no shame no shame whatsoever\nI mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so much blather\nAnd so much nonsense and as long as it's anti Trump you know the audiences\nYou it's good to like the that works really it really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends and you know I'm here in the swamp and what you find out more and\nMore is that so many of these folks that that think that they're standing proud for the truth in the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck in their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they were doing this job and they just want to get his cause you to power responsible and they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit\nAnd there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just that this is a media war we're in the midst of a media war the notion that those who started this war in the mainstream media are the ones who are not calling for civility is just preposterous\nReally is um\nI went to argue about the mobs and all that coming up in a moment but ah\nWe have we have we have much more just 'cause I don't want to be labor at this point to that because we don't know enough about the bombs I Do have Joey Jones coming on a little bit to talk about what we know about the devices themselves will get some of the technical aspects of this uh we're all really up to speed on that and and also just what it takes to um you know get some of these\n... some of these devices were kind of skill set or we really talking about so we'll we'll get into of that I'll have an update for you on the on the caravan coming up\nA which is all of a sudden out it's really going to drop out of the news cycle very quickly and I think it's because Democrats realized this is not the the Democrats pushing all of a side in their quest to do everything they can for illegals not not a winning issue for them and they they don't doesn't work out the way they think it's going to work out ever\nUm we're that an and much where if you want to call it for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred book I'll be right back [noise]\n\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWith retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this the foot of taking out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments or addiction notices\nYeah and that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud\nLook if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies today home title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down their homes title may already be compromise you know sign up and get a free titles scan and report\nThat were sent the high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama and Congress
