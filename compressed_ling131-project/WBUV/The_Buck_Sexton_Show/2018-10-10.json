they're okay with that and we don't have to go by the going alone now means demanding due process going lo means the presumption of innocence to Democrats going lo means not sitting there complacent

secret gang rape is from your teenage years and nobody figured it out until right before you're going to be Supreme Court nominee only idiots can't believe this\nOr people who have been brainwashed people who have been so thoroughly propagandize too that they can't find any weight or reason through these things\nThey really think that Trump is a threat to the republic they really think that Republicans want to uh set up concentration camps on the border for people that aren't from this country but these are this is the kind of rhetoric that they keep using and we say OK okay this must be\nVicious must just be the Democrats trying to fire up the base trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word maybe they actually do believe this stuff or at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues to being dangerous one thing to say the Democrats\nAre ignorant of history and refused to admit or allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that you can't even have a conversation with them any more about this they're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry\nAnd they're being encouraged by their most prominent members to take this out on you I I've\nBeen asked the question is I said what do you do when someone says oh you're a Republican you must be a Nazi the answer is not oh try to convince them you're not in Austin the answers get away from them\nWe are now entering a phase in political discourse where for reasons of self preservation and safety I Would tell you\nDon't engage with these people don't don't talk to them and probably 'cause you just don't know you just don't know it's definitely going to be ugly or going to say terrible things do you can handle the harsh words I Know but it's a\nVery small margin of error between someone getting up in your face because they don't like your politics and screaming at you in front of your wife or your husband or whomever\nAnd all of a sudden a scuffle breaks out and now there's real violence\nAnd that only has to happen once before then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics the impulse to become violent is even more apparent right the impulse to take this to a level of\nHitting people attacking kicking people and perhaps even worse\nDo not forget that the Democrats pushed the lies of the black lives matter movement and there were many many lies I heard them I can tell you what they are among them that there was an epidemic of killing of young black men by racist cops who have their or for whom there's no accountability that's a lie\nOut but among among the many lives that were told to this day as well\nIt didn't lead to any violence that the anti corporate or did not lead to violence there there are five dead officers from Dallas tactic in Texas a who clearly their families their departments their friends would disagree with that notion very strongly\nAs well as ... instances of other violence against cops cross gotta chew killed sitting at a patrol car here in New York City where I'm currently doing this show\nLeft wing rhetoric has led to violence including lethal violence where's the correlate we we hear so much whereabouts do you think are talking about Charlottesville and we will continue to hear about a casualty at Charlottesville\nWhenever this conversation about political violence but yet they are so slow to bring up the many many more casualties that have been caused by political rhetoric from the other side because\nUltimately they can't win these arguments that they're having with us their arguments are not prevailing in the quarter phobic opinion their arguments about cabin or did not prevail\nAnd they are frustrated they are angry and when people become frustrated and angry but also think that they are righteous in that anger they can become dangerous take senator pause warning to heart if this town does not change if there is not\nA willingness among those and media say mob

at a restaurant that is also mop like behavior why is it that I'm willing to concede that Donald Trump is a bad person and that that's my behavior but I never hear liberals come on or ...\nI don't want to say I'm not going to say that that kind of behavior following senator or any other elected official into a restaurant when they're with their family I don't agree with that I did not very I I ...\nI don't know but I I I Know you've got to know where or\nWhen we saw okay I've got to get to the break answer your question to us or is it my behavior\nNo it's not my rights but people who are not the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy either will not leave before you jump in okay\nHe just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled\nHe's a he's a never Trump

think there were four webs on that panel\nIncluding the host or lips and won't do that at the lab valid like bad boy he's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say it on CNN but they're like it's now it's a question of the number one it may not be ... what do you mean it's I'm up\nWhen you've got a big bets when you've got more than three people who are together screaming in your face and acting like maniacs because you're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like your politics they don't like her political party that's getting in the ... when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive about using that\nWere they are very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives to feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lips\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise\nAnti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who don't necessarily agree with that if it was methods but they agree with the message\nAnd they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much\nOf what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys don't I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these incidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nWhere are these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind\nAnd they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing what well is mostly peaceful protest it was a mostly peaceful protests\n... mostly peaceful protest what is it even made\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country has been in turmoil look at the writers\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement\nThen all of a sudden you know they're they're not ... you can't afford them is riders you certainly wouldn't ... what was going on even though it was about race and racial animus and claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nBut that is what it would have been called decades before and if you were to look at what was happening yes a lot of times riots or follow on to demonstrations usually people have to get together first before they can be a big ... destroying things you could always have this\nYeah I I got to say I I don't know how it is that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable I how how that how it is allowed to happen\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there was a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who was a sports\nCaster and she said something about about boots on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female organ that is called by some uh books and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me so this is like which is\nOver and it was a big problem but then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very racially inflammatory language being used and and people laughing and and mocking\nTanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on it but I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time it their grasping for reasons are grasping for for ways to justify\nA their intolerance of other ideas the the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies you know we have so few celebrities on the right that speak\nOr soap operas alright period and we have so few people that come out and and espouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land says anything about being pro Trump each there's this mob ... yes there's that word again this mob mentality to\nTear him down immediately it's one thing that they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you of every idiot\nCelebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name what Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these these people were\nAll just absolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin and it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a comedy you know all of them are on this one side and any of that and all the music artist you know this is always the big joke with\nWhenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artist I don't know uh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country anthems that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone's who's your favorite country artist John I'd ... I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just because he's a woman I think of off the top of my ... no no she economy is Garth Brooks no come on anyway\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and ... out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah I looked I asked him Baldwin Nick Searcy\nA James Woods there's Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there are some conservatives out there for sure but we have worn high level music act like this and really more of a ... you look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big ... fan or isn't gay or you see\nJohn that we call and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right yeah that's right I work I mean technically I worked for her media so I feel like I Need to know more about the music industry lingo show but but they're they're piling on him and why was because they resent\nAny loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber of fucking love when it comes to any cultural\nA music Hollywood figure\nAnd they they they cannot abide it they cannot deal with it and I mean I Can't deal with them like they cannot psychologically process it it concerns them it worries them they don't they don't know what they would do they don't know how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities that they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip and uh\nThat's that's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this by the way\nUm I Would just note that the\nIRS or for a moment we have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we all want to say here here's what we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is if everybody that uh the the people they just chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible storm a hundred and fifty plus miles an hour\nEr visits twelve inches of rain but the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether ... or fourteen feet it's all deadly\nAnd I'm very concerned that people are not taking any consideration so we are ready to respond we can't help anybody now that chose not to evacuate or they have to hunker down and take care of themselves a we have Nineteen thousand a people that are\nAlready free physicians that gets the power back on but I Am scared to death to people that chose not to go back in fact the way this is they just say her when a storm and\nThat's the Governor Scott and Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thoughts and prayers everybody's affected I Know we've got a lot of great listener as a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down in in the state is is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people right because the the hurricane before this there was a lot of\nOh this is going to be a huge and we we I remember seeing it way out in the medical might get that you know is that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am\nI mistaken him that notion yeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right\nI mean it's coming up to a point where it they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I've been seeing it usually it's usually from the Olympics yeah right in the ... the east coast of the four oh well\nI Hope everyone is All right I I'm surprised I'm hearing that there's been a lot of lot of people decided not to evacuate and we just like I said also preserving but what more coming up you're in a second on the continued fought from\nKavanaugh left is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to [noise] to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing

Fox News the worst of hurricane Michael has already passed Florida governor Rick Scott warned knock\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a

using prosecutorial discretion he would\nEffectively abrogate immigration law and say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going

there'll be better times when\nPlenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we got to have the ... we got our video J. really take a good look now that told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe\nUnder investigation for possible leaking classified material let's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually make the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges let's see what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll Bach no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country\nBack into that mess at mass speaking the FBI by the way you know Rand Paul is that a tough\nYear year and a half\nRand Paul is holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying step you'd think that given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community or in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these process these work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again and I remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government for partisan purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government\nIs full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\nTeam it is an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the

all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house and the senator one or the other side of the aisle\n[noise] well I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I look at pretty closely I Will take to the question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now is motive motivating people to turn out\nAh for November having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever at\nThe midterms are going to be over you know this fuck your listeners know this is seen as the midterms are literally within ...\nHours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about the twenty\nTwenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the truth blues purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election whereas the left positioning itself to Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nHere one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas law suits or which aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with preexisting conditions provision and Obamacare\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because they're pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about preexisting conditions when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last\nTen years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge to every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically one single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and can never happen\nThey do feel sufficiently would they would prefer a government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to they're not going to deny that they're forcing the air they're gonna say yeah unfortunately they're all that time over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that out you know over you've been involved in this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate where the projections of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion of the country back in the early days the Obama administration", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Moss Point", "day": "10"}
