include every other class of persons that's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders\nThere are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners\nFor the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and they were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states\nIllegally\nNow this is where we get into some complexity in some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon\nRight if you come into America and you have a child the law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship or it or birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there have been all stories on that so where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that uh they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or whatever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have\nCitizenship well gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatched for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it\nThan that and we obviously can\nTell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving but all of it as a citizen right all but this person's a citizen and people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah\nThey're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law\nAnd they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be put in our interests ahead of the interests of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country or another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states\nAre inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist and then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here what your Democrat to really watch the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth\nAmendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person has citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right so if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you are waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family\nReunification migration a chain migration to bring interest the family in the oil revenues have one kid in America I Know you're\nAlready at the front of the line when it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you that\nA Center for Immigration Studies there you go about a fifth one in five and twenty fourteen seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to an immigrant's whether legal or illegal\nAnd illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams believe that three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states but it's\nNot just a three hundred thousand or so I remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here illegally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families so forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family\nFor a for a legal immigration system ah forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen child an American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\nBaby right it's essentially gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is a illegal\nRight the crossing into the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe that but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigrations and Customs Enforcement later tries\nTo deport the parents they're breaking up families\nTrump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way\nI mean probably not from a perspective of separation of powers of the constitution there are some decisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a who's a citizen subject\nThe jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction\nUm but the courts have never really weighed in on this and a clear fashion so yes Trump's executive order on this show to get science should he do it will clearly be challenge right away by the never Trump judiciary\nAnd quite honestly it'd probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did it it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue but it will get fast tracked I think\nTo the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out if in fact the Supreme Court\nWants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through continued loopholes in the immigration system because it benefits Democrats\nThat's we're going to find out and by the way if the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or rather if you're born in this country or no longer\nTo be an automatic citizen what does that say about the scam the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time what does that say about what's been going on if that if that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and of of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution\nSo we really so the American people really would have been scammed all this time oh it when you look at this we're the outlier there are roughly thirty countries in the world where if you're born in them you get citizenship automatically the only ones that are that are developed world or the U.S and Canada no European country does this for example not\nAlways of the president's

Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who\nI I don't know how you can think he's a good idea of the state of Florida I mean I we've played it on this show and the ... election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor\nBut Gillum guy with a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nConversation around this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up the the future uh for the Democrat Party\nAnd you know there's going to kill him though we've we've talked or we've talked about before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care of it\nReally what it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really\n... they're gonna raise taxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid health outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools\nYou can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot more a lot less money on schools and have them be good\nBut the lid answer is always just more money for schools that's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart you actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system\nWhich you see is the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers go into these bureaucrats administrators\nThe teaching system what do you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean given image to bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy um\nYou know he's very very willing to uh say whatever he thinks he has to say about the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it play fourteen\nFacts as to how the given too much harbor a chore racism is\nEnough votes anti Semite he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News said to the voters afloat and that's a monkey the state of price\nRace has been an issue from the very beginning or in this campaign that because I introduce my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nBecause you both get dirty but they actually like\nThe fans of the Trump wants to do was to drag me into the gutter yeah for\nBecause they can survive getting dirty I Can't survive\nNow let me just take a moment as stand back with you and just admire what what happened there\nThat is a rhetorical technique known as predator rich CEO\nBetter rich ... is I could talk about how my opponent is a complete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do as a form of attack and a a\nPredator rich CEO in this case is on full display he says well you know dissenters said monkey it up about the state he's cruising just than just as a racist that's what that is with any but then he immediately switches to\nBudge I don't want to play dirty and wrestle with pigs why won't\nDo that or the the classic cynical\nTechnique of politicians and it's right there on display for you from uh from Gillum or who I Would notice a minor standings Tallahassee has got a lot of problems in the city which is not surprising at all\nBut speaking of the supporters of the left by this was during a moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims Marsha Blackburn had a had a rally and she called for a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh and\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople would say there was like oh they they'll they'll there'll be paying taxes to really\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more and government benefits and they'd pay in taxes even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off as a country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided okay how is it supposed to make us less divided you bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay who do not speak the language\nWho do not share our culture\nAnd whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat's going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that are up to this point the most of us had been on aware of that I that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with a big fat joke stupid they stay very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway ... today goes on national television she several this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious out of it no man\nThe propaganda industry that she commands with a vile president that she serves a bet it by mark ... van and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart News pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the incitement that they have made that have triggered and radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ... he said it\nDoes lead writer and a lot of interest guys aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign in at any level tells you really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was do and he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin at the VP was the great a great idea writer who is part of that whole process\nSo but he but to the to the main point here claiming that Breitbart and ... a rash and live in and others have blood on their hands is just is just a a a smear\nEach just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after an anti after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue this complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after ...\n\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical but he doesn't care\nAnd that MSNBC put this on their air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments of the right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation\nAfter they got this guy yeah the guy a lot on his parents were thing the thing about the during the\nStage but with the now with the flu\nOr look market within doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know that it's just it's just an outrage somebody would set of them are at work\nAbout rush or any of total outrage but I must be see is maybe that's why I I don't spend as much time on it because MSNBC is almost in terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of left it it's really beneath contempt\nUh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe that history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math is not an essential elements of good policy making ... ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC\nAnd that everybody should claim that they're a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that that's a recipe for healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers mind\nMan\nIt is it has been rough watching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just outrageous stuff and then turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things oh wait\nWait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV let's just throw in one one more one more out there who is a quote conservative oh you know it was coming the left favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly on the right Jennifer Rubin\nWho you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things that I have a red in in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer and I I Wish we saw and heard more from Charles these\nDays I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but I've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented or what Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes one year and then writes the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nLike this is a really good idea for it was just terrible for Israel you know this was a really good thing for concern for conservative\nOr there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough he's an opening to trash trumped ready Semitism she take it to play Fifteen\nThat's not the way it has present the entire country he does not believe that people respond to a good thing that out there talking about his tax plan it out there talking about these great trade deal he got down the line take out there and I'm leaving the bloody shirt and that's what he does
