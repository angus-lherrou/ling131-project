that you feel the same way that any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a master from happening to help anyone who was\nCaught in such a horrific circumstances and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer and uh and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country and yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than they make this about Trump these people who do this\nEvery day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective\nYou know last week we were told that\nWas a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy who had already called it a bomb threat you know over it\nA decade before Trump's presidential run in ... a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticized as people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted\nThey can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals but they say that Trump is basically responsible did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't\nPack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way\nAnd what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro mug up paraphernalia and so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd we are\nTold that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and too favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump has just raised hate in America\nLet's be clear that that means that not Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges it a hate crime against anyone else\nYou know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know be ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's wall because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because he has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there is violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness\nAt it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that\nI Can't even begin to fathom I\nI I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live eat and brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beach you into submission bludgeon\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these\nProblems all this violence is nothing to do with their calling President Trump an anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish son in law's Jewish bonkers converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close but they say this the\nMedia says they pat themselves in the back oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a punch of destructive little ... that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who justify this his position for Jews\nDecides to be violent engages in his in his replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy trying to track attached drawn to this though it's\nJust so intellectually dishonest it show unfair\nAnd it just goes to show you that there is there was no effort in good faith there's no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives I I agree with Trump\nAnd that the press does drive a lot of this\nBecause the press is full of a bunch of preening\nSelf obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know ... book you're in the media the I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists posing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they're the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else of exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they were tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and that in the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing\nThis country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair argument about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness\nAnd destructive politics and lots and that's what they're doing that's what the name of the president and we're going to continue to see this unfortunate where we're going to talk about the caravan coming up got some big

certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing is okay and that's why yes there are always been a anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism goes hand in hand with anti Semitism that's higher idea of anti Semitism is to put ... outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's what Donald Trump does that his team that's what his party is now committed to doing\nA limitation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh\nIt is directly somewhat you know that ... they'll always put his paw fire its Trump's fall to the extent\nYou know or you know Trump Trump shit old some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful what when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there\nNo there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an angel supporters to all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this evening hatred of the Trump voter to\nA that's a part of the anti Trump movement they despise the voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled they have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining weren't good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes\nBut I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us because of all that\nAnd that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always\nOn the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated this ah what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that\nIt's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this you know it's\nIt's interesting that that he can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemn this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump's condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't announced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say well why does Trump talk about white nationalist so\nMuch you can't win folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend the most basic level of\nGood faith to him in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatism is fake Republicans like Jennifer Reuben who's the she is the queen of fake Republicans the Washington Post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing but you know she she blames Trump not just for what\nHappened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd I've got a ... gallon ... high in fat I Love faith and we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last hair and anti snack hate crimes\nFor the biggest ... theme and anti Semitism is that here's our outsiders they are Atlanta they need to find a nation by\nI Would say to them [noise] you are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that as America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for\nWill not stand for your time to [noise]\n\nThe greatest president in my lifetime with the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what\nThe full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a ... that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to\nCompare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other and those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all star\nAnd so true anti Semitism and drew racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political cultural\nOr true anti Semitism and racism and a ... and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the ... rights and if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really us conservatism and conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative\nAnd believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worse as human beings and as citizens of this great nation\nSo when the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservatives though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in\nThe common good as defined by a core of elites\nThat all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leaves as elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we are\nAll God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to\nMake this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a\nA real feeling of uh of outrage at that because they show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives\nAre racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lot it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender they're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with\nWith race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get so there I said triggered when you just brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage direct that has been\nThe aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party there's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding in the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this but it's not really just about what the founding fathers said at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] it is the fact opposite of a true conservative to believe the first thing is less than because of their skin color is a person is less than because of gender less then because of religious [noise] that is not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you
