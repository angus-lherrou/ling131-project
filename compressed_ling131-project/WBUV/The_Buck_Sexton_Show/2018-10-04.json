of law enforcement he was part of the NYPD terror squad back in the day buck was part of the team that took down the times square bomber help catch the guys he was getting ready to get on a plane and get out of the country\nSo I Know this audience supports law enforcement\nBut uh after what happened in Florence South Carolina last night we have to get into that and we have to talk about law enforcement I've got a buddy who's gonna joined us there but where\nWhere are we what do you think the forty five pages of interviews summaries the sixteen hundred pages of tip line information where are you on this final final last hours of the Kavanaugh confirmations do you think it's going to happen\nYes or no and do you have a thought on the vote count\nI Love to hear from you weigh in on this\nEight for for nine hundred book eight for for nine hundred to eight to five\nWe'll take calls all night that's one thing I Love about this audience the buck sex than show audience smart responsive and are you guys are always make me work harder which is a good thing now what do we have to get to today a week ago\nI was in Washington DC a week ago I was in Washington DC covering the hearing that that took the last bits of testimony\nFrom Kavanaugh and a doctor for it I ran into bought that day and it was raining crazy in Washington DC and that's kind of where we set up this week in felons yadda yadda yadda\nBut as I was there I stood inside the Senate office building\nAnd covered some of the protests and I asked or tried to ask Elizabeth Warren when she was going to take a DNA test and she turned and ran away wouldn't answer it got mad at me a than a Jeff Merkley of Oregon another Democrat was there and I asked\nHim if he didn't think Joe Biden statement on FBI reports about sexual abuse and sexual harassment because he said they they were not worth anything if that didn't hurt his argument and he denied knowing about it which is a lie and then he turned\nThen ran away and I wish\nI were in D.C today I'm not I'm In the constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware\nAnd I'm watching the reports of the busloads and busloads of people who are headed to DC\nAnd I watch some of the marches around the Capitol today with women holding a pre printed signs and women wearing the shirts that say be a hero and the signs that say cabin nope\nAnd all the stuff that has been printed by George Soros funded groups are printed by planned\nParenthood but either way can we talk about Planned Parenthood opposing judge Kavanaugh don't they get a billion\nDollars or more in taxpayer funding\nI think they do I think it might even be more than that Planned Parenthood gets a lot of our money gets money from me gets money from you\nAnd when I was at the protest last week a week ago Planned Parenthood is set up camp\nOn the benches in the quad drained go inside the U.S Senate office building and they were working the room handing out free T shirts to anybody who wanted them three T shirts and they have pre printed signs\nThey also had stationary and directions on how you could write a letter\nTo your a senator or congressman to tell them that they needed to be vocal about Kevin\nAnd this is all your tax dollars at work I thought I thought Planned Parenthood was all about women's health and I thought\nSo giving away free T shirts to oppose\nA nominee to the Supreme Court that's that's really what's your all about it seems like we need to pull that funding back\nAnd I know some of you are going to say look Planned Parenthood does things really good things well Planned Parenthood does not do mammogram so anyone who tells you as Planned Parenthood did today\nThat are ... are all about breast health they might be but Planned Parenthood doesn't give mammograms they don't provide that\nSo there's\nA little bit of ... there as well we we have much to get into day well like I said we're going to talk about China getting inside our phones and spying on us it it's not just um\nIt's not just a Dianne Feinstein\nWho had a Chinese spy apparently all of us who have a cell phone or computer may have a Chinese spy or first call the night goes to a New Mexico the land of the rising sun Jeremy join the conversation tonight Jeremy welcome to the buck sex than show just due to my friends\nThat pseudo hey first off how happy acknowledged day\nBy the way\nThey're happy or ten for\nBig knowledge today [noise] um I I I really think that Kavanaugh is going to be he'll be confirmed and all I wouldn't doubt it if there's going to get a few Democrats that that the Democrat leadership to just say go ahead and vote for him that way you'll look good in front of your people um\nI I ... I really feel for professor Ford as a you know and and and Brett Kavanaugh because they were both mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about when she was asked\nThat you know\nWe could have come come to you in California to be interviewed she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nThat the Democrats paid for\nIt not informed of this option they want it because they wanted her to come to DC and they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege and she was like no I I I Would have I Would have entertained them coming to me and and answer their questions in California I think that\nShe really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet\nAnd then the Democrats said this is something we can use to a\nStore and she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for\nSomething happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put in there\nThe story changed the dates changed\nThe story about having to doorways at her house really doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house so it wasn't about being panicked\nThe story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world and big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter she thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen so a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just affected in business relations with the fact that in every aspect of her life\nSo there's just too much there\nTo hang this on Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by the way\nWe'll get into the devil's triangle tonight because they yearbooks are really going to weigh into my conversations this evening I've done a little bit of snooping Jeremy Jeremy or can I ask when you graduated high school\nI graduated in Ninety seven and here's here's a here's here's another thing that I'd like to throw out there to okay currents who are listening to this\nThis is something I'm not a victim of sexual assault is but my wife was when she was younger literally Thirty years ago when she was you know you know early early early single digits and it was by a\nUm a cousin who was not very mature it himself\nHe he later he did not get the therapy he needed he did not get the help he needed later relapse\nAnd re offended um and the problems she had was her parents I mean they're great people I I Love my in laws but they never acknowledge that the trauma that happened they just try to sweep it under the rug and they didn't want to talk about it parents should not do that\nThat cause after we got married and frankly you know start having sex that came back up those those feelings mills heart things came back up and just the other day she got word that her cousin that she thought was not going to be getting out of jail anytime soon\nA large Kandahar\nCombination of Brett\nCloture vote is expected tomorrow here in the

about the Supreme Court Robert thanks for hanging on you want it to make a point about what's more important\nYes if you look at the civil rights act in the voting rights act in sixty four sixty five you'll see a presidential what they've been doing the Democrats have been doing for over ... years we had the ... out here\nThey were all Democrats they weren't ever go damn bogus through because the senators had to go back to their states get reelected while they're not going to get reelected if they support these laws\nAre not against them I'm Glad that got passed but they laid the foundation for legislation through litigation back then and they're using it ever since I was a reasonable hour they cannot ... because it's just a second point if you look at creating court judges through three more\nAt the very top they're Seventy five here which can work and how much the youngest several a story that could conceivably go within the next six years that would give Trump or even more because you don't win reelection totally totally\nWell if you base it on the economy and if we think James Carville for it's the economy stupid then yeah the the president stands a real good chance against one of the seven thousand possible democratic candidates who are being talked about to face him\nAnd this would be if Donald Trump get one more\nThis would be a landmark this would be total game changing in terms of moving the court to a more conservative or at the position than anyone could ever see so uh I'm with you on a think cabinet gets through what what did you think the vote was the vote counts going to be Robert\nIs going to pass it's going to throw this uh the deciding vote has just leadership is the best advice pressed is president of the ... ... ... ...\nThat's right that's

the answer is going to be to decider because uh the stiff neck a Democrats just don't know what they're doing\nWell I I just\nThat's what that's what I wanted to call about because Trump\nThey usually do but he is he forced the media I mean he absolutely forced them\nTo put out what the ... a professor had said in the hearings which the media didn't report they report it cabin all but they didn't

about Mike Pence and China that's coming up the bottom and next our with our friend Gordon Chang but I Want to get\nBack to your books it was just a body a week ago that judge Kavanaugh had to face some ridiculous questions\nFrom Senator Whitehouse a Democrat who was going through judge Kavanaugh's yearbook dream members some of the ridiculous moments one of them surrounded\nA couple I'm surrounded alcohol but vomiting so first we went with bar fang you're worried about\nMy yearbook better um website look at a beach week Ralph club ... biggest contributor which is the word Ralph\nMe and I'm not a that probably ... to a throwing up on known to have a weak stomach and I always have in fact the last time I was here you asked me about having catch up on spaghetti I always had a weak stomach [noise] I don't know that I have to catch spaghetti you didn't someone did and and this is well known anyone who's now that\nWe're asking about catch up on spaghetti this is what's going on in the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the confirmation but it got weirder than that talking about your books and comments off\nAnd he\nDoes the word Ralph you use our yard is already answered all if you're ... [noise] I like that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center or not um what do you watch the next one is\nSo cabinet I got heat for that for that answer for confronting White House or his obsession with a teenager who may have consumed enough beer to vomit and then it got we went from ... to boot thing\nOr what do you have a view I don't know if it's books are being ... how do you pronounce a cover for ... we were sixteen [noise] okay [noise]\nSo that went on for a while\nAnd and they were obsessed with the F word and I'm sure the senator has never heard the F word in his life said this this whole obsession with your books in high school yearbooks got me thinking so what did I Do I die then to\nThe high school yearbooks as some of the people on this committee the Democrats on this committee\nI went and looked at Richard Blumenthal Da Nang jak\nThe guy who has a committed stolen valor in my opinion by claiming he was fighting in Vietnam when he wasn't\nHe uh he did serve this country in the marine corps reserves achieving the rank of sergeant no that's not really achieving there are a lot of sergeants I Know who did work hard but if you're going to college and then you're getting in the military they tend to make an officer right out of the blocks\nSo ... saying that he was serving in Vietnam then had to come back and make a cheerful apology or this guy was a child of privilege was in a private school and are played on the tennis team and was on the swim team\nAnd then I started looking at Cory Booker Spartacus Spartacus Booker who was a football player in his school and if you look at a Cory bookers senior page on on the uh high school yearbook\nYou can see Cory bookers nickname was sugar that's what he was known to the students in his high school sugar\nThat sugar low sugar can we find out what sugar means what does that mean because some people in the eighties referred to cocaine is sugar\nShould we assume that Cory Booker may have been doing drugs because his name was sugar and in his senior year your book quote Cory Booker has the phrase\nLet's go all the way so what's\nGoing on with Cory Booker what does that mean Cory Booker this is a guy who remember wrote the essay about groping a woman at the age of Fifteen the essay about stealing second amusing air quotes they're\nSo why are we putting the year books of all of the Judiciary Committee people up somewhere why aren't we taking Cory bookers stealing second Cory Booker Spartacus and ask him what does he mean by let's\nGo all the way he was grabbing Fifteen year olds\nAnd

silliness\nAround judge Kavanaugh's year book and the focus on things like the devil's triangle\nWe played Senator Whitehouse mocking Kavanaugh talking about a bar fearing booth thing and the devil's triangle which cabinet insisted was drinking game\nWhite House told them he thought he was lying to him that he didn't believe it was a drinking game that he thought that was something nefarious here\nAnd if you go to the Urban Dictionary which I advise you do not do it at work and you look up the devil's triangle you will see that it is a an some definitions a a ... you have to walk with two men and one woman\nBut in the era of judge Kavanaugh the devil's triangle was according to some of his classmates who wrote a letter I Am in possession of the letter right here that was sent to chairman Grassley right here right here [noise] got it right here\nDeer chairman Grassley and ranking member Feinstein so went to both of them\nWe're classmates have Brent Kavanaugh says from Georgetown Prep a Jesuit high school in Washington DC area we write to clear if any misunderstanding about the phrase devil's triangle that appeared on our Nineteen eighty three high school yearbook\nIncluding on our individual yearbook pages that phrase was the subject of questioning a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last week and has since been discussed in the media oh has it\nThe devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school\nIt was a variation on the game quarters and if you remember judge Kavanaugh said it's a drinking game senator do you know

eighties I'm accuweather meteorologist steam divorce\n[noise] this is from Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly minutes one new software for nine WB the\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for self taught never saw [noise] well\nIt's not exactly bucks sex then but it's the godfather Michael Palca sitting in for my friend bucks X then tonight I Love this audience and you know today today I was very busy monitoring all the Kavanaugh stuff\nBut uh if you drifted over to C SPAN as geeks like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tank scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nAnd worst of all China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with Donald Trump and Kim Jong on\nAnd this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think it's just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it at Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population are resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense a not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them\nBut I think China is starting to get to be a a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our naval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence because the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these encounters\nChinese had been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing it's Soviet minister rations working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that in vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to other people\nYou can find it it's on line and you can do something ... going the CSPAN and watch it which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential to be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations\nUh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions and I think he is a a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now is fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the
