NPR News I'm Tom Vitale in New York [noise]\nFinally today our visit with another of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowship whenever\nThe so called genius grants that you have an Eighteen class includes many artists and scientists and performers and the Reverend William Barber the second\nBarbara might be best known for his moral Monday protests outside of the state house in North Carolina he was among the first to draw attention to strategies that he said ... suppressing the participation of poor and minority voters\nHe's let non violent protests across the country to fight poverty and racism and the Reverend William Barber the second is now on the line from North Carolina Thank you so much for joining us\nCongratulations to you thank you so much so how did you react when you first heard this news said you had been awarded the surprise\nWell you know you don't know it's anonymous you don't even know that follow you don't know who a central name and they called me I told him to stop playing I thought it was a prank\nOr basically do this for real uh then the next thing for me was two years I've thought about all the things that my parents have done it sacrifice to all the years of just working and trying to serve um it was kind of overwhelming and you know especially that went in to work out do\nA lot of times people are very very nasty in that criticism stay say you're doing it for money you're doing it for attention and a big question your motives when the reality is you know you just want to let people see justice for the ... you want to see people are voting rights and people have health care and\nPeople treated right regardless of their race color creed their sexuality\nSo a gift like this says somebody else sees what you're trying to do and they want to be a part of you continue to do that were when they told me\nThat the ... come out I was actually in custody stand with low wage workers and\nAnd nurses and people working at McDonald's and that's what I was doing\nWe usually think of this crap that goes to people in the science and art will to stimulate creativity [noise] um so so tell me about the role that creativity place an activism\n[noise] well you know ... in every age we know what works people going to make a difference we do that ... ... civil disobedience works we know the protests works we'd do that voting works but in every age is different or you have to face it up just weigh in Eighteen hundred for as they were just trying to get the right to vote now\nAnd then the Nineteen sixties today we're trying to hold on to what we want before and then press on to what we need to see that you know we have tried to hold on to basic voting rights but we also want to get to where everybody Eighteen is automatically registered and where voting as a holiday where same day registration or the voting there's something that happens in every state\nUh you know years ago people were fighting just to talk about the Afghan nap today we've tried to hold onto their five to ... a form of carrot add the expanded the universal health care or so it takes it requires a certain understanding of the time\nThey had but and I'm thinking about things like how do you get people to see these issues in a fresh way which is kind of the essence of creativity I mean some of your techniques like preaching\nA speaking writing demonstrating those are classics but you've also done things that are kind of ... like you know give me an example of kind of like a fresh way to get people to look at something that they think that they already understand\nWhat you know you read mix I mean James Brown was classic so but the rappers ... so ... so what you do is for instance back in in the day\nThey had three schools and teach them about what we did with Maro Monday is and what we do around the country we do something to call but imposed a mall political organizing leadership Institute and ... and what we do is we bring people together of all races treats colors\nAnd class then we'd say okay let's look at voter suppression of what is the the real numbers the Iraq War data twenty six states lift those same states a hot topic these days those same state\nPassed laws against immigrant people and gay people those same states up to bat\nOr a Medicaid expansion those same states did not union rights so if ... if if the same states that passed racialized voter suppression and the people that get elected because of racialized voter suppression being used the election to hurt mostly white people\nAnd most of the poor people and we show people that empirically then they began to say oh wait a minute we're fighting the same people the same people that are attacking the immigrants that uh one of the attack and help get the same people that are ...\nAre the ones that are attacking voting rights and so if they are cynical about duck to be together we have to be smart enough to come together that is the way in which you read mix if you will what was done it a pass a new expanded and depressed\nSo before we wrap up here as he mentioned at the outset that this is not a lifetime achievement award this is an investment in you to watch whatever it is you want to do next as you know when the\nMacArthur genius grant when as previously with Lin Manuel Miranda who wrote Hamilton so you know no pressure um what what what are you going to deal with the ... have you thought about it\nWell I Know what I'm going to do with life and however the grass and changes I don't see in another reason for me to be allowed to have to work on these issues of racism and poverty and ecological devastation war economy\nAnd and and try to be or what I called Marlin Allison Ball a ticket ... action\nOf deep diving into the poor people's campaign three pairs of the breach that organization I leave my church where I passed a Green Bay Christian Church and I don't know ma Cher if what we do will sold the seed of future transformation or if we will see the victim and the parent tire which we live but\nWhat I Do know is as for me and my houses it's good to say we're going to continue to serve this call because we believe that love and justice emerged to those things are important and there's nothing more important than serving\nIs the Reverend William Barber the second he's the pastor ...

students I talked to had actually heard about this class word of mouth and many of them were expecting good jobs after graduation Patterson high school is about Seventy percent Latino\nAnd it's a pretty low income community Seventy five percent of\nPatterson students are on reduced and free lunch so a warehouse job that pays eleven dollars maybe sixteen dollars an hour right after graduation that's attractive much better than working at fast food [noise]\nAs he shows me around Larry insist that I Try out the order pick our machine it's like a lift designed to help you reach the highest shelves in a warehouse for them\nTo read them on the other one\nHe harnesses me in and sends me up\nCasual three stories high\nVicky\nAll the kids down below were laughing at me and I think all these

... phone in the compactor\nWarehouses are booming now but of course it's not a brand new industry\nWhen World War two broke out Americans needed to quickly move goods overseas and they needed a warehouse system to do it\nThan the private industry followed by the development of the highway system [noise]\nAbout how hard it was to maintain inventory and move millions of things across the country all without a computer\nSo why industry used to be all about storing stuff now it's all about some filling online orders and replacing traditional retail\nThe school's hope is that after graduation these kids get jobs in the industry and some of them actually have like many only about it he graduated from Patterson high school in two thousand Eighteen I meet him really early in the

place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco one of those warehouses this Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing well actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears just

there's only so much you can control or anyone can over an industry that has\nA somewhat disposable workforce even Larry he spent over Twenty years in the industry doing every job there has to do only

I was somewhere else\nSo I asked him if he worries about teaching kids to do a job where workers are maybe just a number on a budget lie regardless of their skills but\nYou also have the skills to write like he was in and then she's like years and\nYou didn't protect me but you know I could at least a little more students them the opportunity to walk into a job again in some something even though they may end up being\n\nAfter his shift and the crate and barrel I meet up with many again the former Patterson student who I interviewed in his car he's a little tired\nStressful [laughter] yeah or\nTaken every day when he gets home he has to recharge quickly and then get ready for night school he's working full time right now I'm going to cost four nights a week [noise] his dream is to one day go to college to Cal Poly specifically\nThere's the famous engineering school here in California who want to be like a civil engineer\nHe wants to buy a house one day a two story house\nOr even the most one story ... voice on the ranch I'm really\nNot to actually to having a good part of\nMany shot by the warehouse picker has been good for him for now but [noise] it's just a stepping stone to hustle it's not going to provide the future he the for himself [noise]\nThinks of ya story end this segment was reported research conducted for Latino USA by the community service society of New York you can find more information about these trends C. C. N. Y. dot org slash that you know usa [noise]\n\n\nYou've been watching or listening to the news or being anywhere near a television set over the past week then you've probably heard or seen\nThat once

twenty eight while he was in an elevator in the Senate office building oh\nLincoln just announced that he would vote to confirm the judge Brett Kavanaugh for\nHow do you\nLive to\nHim and demanded that fleet consider what his vote would mean for women who like them and survived the sexual assault [noise]\nYou're not going\nTo leader that same day Jeff Flake backpedaled and asked for a delay in the Senate vote on Kavanaugh confirmation asking for an FBI investigation\nA change in the elevator though ... across the news and social media and it became emblematic of a moment in our national conversation when many women are demanding that their personal experiences of sexual assault be taken seriously\nSo right after the incident we reached out to an ... cheetah she's a Colombian immigrants who runs a national nonprofit organization called the center for popular democracy and in our conversation we learned that and and my aunt Sheila had actually been preparing for that moment for most of her life\nI on ... welcome to let us say\nThank you so much so I'm September\nTwenty eighth you made a road of me line actually who to target Senator Flake and as a result of that you made a a narrative road that nobody could have imagined\nSo the story of friday begins many months ago the Trump election I think just created a sense of kind of unveiling of\nThe ugly underbelly of the country my organization the center for popular democracy which is a network of community organizations had been training people across the country for months and these tactics that we called bird doggy burn dogging burn jogging\n[noise] what is it [laughter] Brittany apparently is the name of the tactic where you just for human interaction with an elected official [noise]\nYou just show up at their offices and you say hey I'm here I Want to talk to you right now I Know you're there\nLet me tell you my story right now and you\nLearned how to do this somebody a colleague of mine Jennifer ... she's the one who taught me about or jogging and she went across the country training people she sent emails to her friends and said if you can put Fifteen people in a room I Will come to you and train you on bird talking tactics and civil disobedience\nDo you remember the ... the thing that you remember the most that impacted you when you first experienced bird dog eating\nA colleague of his name is Eddie bark and he was diagnosed with a a less and he went to D.C for the first time to fight the tax bill to tell his story when I was flying back home to Santa Barbara where he lived he bumped into Senator Jeff flake on a plane\nAnd the bird dog Senator Flake in that play\nWhatever was one of our summers are no war there was\nA real burden on the river where art and\nTold him that Senator Flake I Am dying of al is if you vote for the tax bill you will take away my disability payments you will take away my health care and I will not be able to be around for my son to grow up I Need you to be a hero\nIn that moment that interaction went viral\nThat gas made headlines when he confronted a Republican senator on an airplane about the upcoming vote on the latest version of this tax bill\nAnd thousands of people than began to follow IDs deaths and come to Washington DC to fight to\nTax break there have been more than a hunger a demonstration of already targeting Republican lawmakers many\nOf those people came back to join the members of United we dream to fight for\nThat matter and also known as dreamers are protesters sailing Shana crop Pennsylvania street linking arms outside and Senator Joe Donnelly the office of the\nMany of them came back to join the women's march\nOrganizers were just hoping to get about two hundred thousand but for have gotten more than two hundred thousand to\nFight against the separation of children at the border and many of these folks have been in Washington DC the last several weeks bird dog and members of Congress following their senators to try to force him person interactions with them and to tell them their stories [laughter]\nAnd so that's how I ended up in D.C this week and I'm sure that there are people are saying I'm hearing bird dog again and I'm feeling uncomfortable is it about confronting jumping taking on being confrontational\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected\nOfficials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\nWhen\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment\nI just went with it and I said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized oh my God maybe my father will hear it this way maybe my monitor these way [noise]\nThen it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted made that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Austin", "day": "07"}
