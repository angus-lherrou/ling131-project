like there's not not much happening\nHere we've got kind of plastic tables filled out shares we've got kind of written up fine if for his first yeah but what's so powerful is that\nWe did up and politics with just a ragtag group of people from all different backgrounds and that\nI Am working class and I was working at a restaurant\nA couple of months ago and because that story is so powerful that's the first thing they're going to go after so the first thing that they did was like oh like she grew up in our house and so that's like disqualifying\nUm and I because I you know so much of his run was informed by the fact that I grew up between two worlds\nI grew up born in a place where my ZIP Code determine my destiny and my parents did everything in their power\nTo move me out of that ZIP Code but I grew up feeling that like that was an injustice the fact that I had to move away from my family and urge you get a better in order at our school better that's right in order to get the same chance that any other American Kids should get\nAnd so on so I think the first thing that they tried to do with like say that I'm well to do and all of these things which couldn't be further from the truth but I mean we don't pay attention to misinformation and we were the reason I think we got\nHere with because we're always laser focused on our mission and it's reaching out to working class people and showing people that were there for them\nOkay let's go down to yeah I wanted to make sure that like some of their didn't just stay in her\nOffice so we headed out to the street you're slaps

immigrant neighborhood in a\nIn the district in Queens and this is where our campaign has been headquartered for a few months now and it you know it's a fabulous really rich community this area is very Latino but it's also specifically very Colombian Mexican Ecuadorian\nThis community is actually\nOne of the more difficult to organize elected for early and I noticed this about a year ago\nYour

to the neighborhood\nFor this one instance did not want\nWhat people are not understanding is the fear\nThat it's happening in our community\nI mean how do you manage that where you're just like okay I'm trying to be sensitive here all of a sudden the next day you are the next hour and a half like sure\nNominal amount of blowback teeth\nAlways put my community first no matter what I got a lot\nOf blowback that week but you know what the community was telling me that we think you\nPeople really understood why and they think to me for creating a safe for them because in every other context in politics right now you need to pay ten thousand dollars a plate to get that kind of intimacy with your public official and the reason people elected me was to speak truth to power\nThat is why I was elected I was elected to fight for working class people and to speak truth to power\nEven if it makes you feel uncomfortable even if it was like you're pushing a lot of people for sure\nAnd I feel uncomfortable all the time this is I don't take joy in doing this you know I don't like [noise]\nOr aim to be a provocative tore or anything like that it's just the truth is provocative\nWe're using in your face combative young person in your college no no\nAnd that's just not my style it's just I think just because of the the\nThemes of what we're talking about\nWe're unafraid to draw really

systematically and repeatedly violate human rights cannot be reform it must be abolished you're talking about ice\nTo me these are moral questions because we are at points in this country where issues that used to be not partisan at all are now polarizing you just look at what happened in immigration in this country the most liberal president\nOn immigration was a Republican Ronald Reagan passing amnesty in the Nineteen eighties getting all undocumented people a\nPath to citizenship and immigration was not always a partisan issue and in fact the Democratic party used to be very conservative on this issue even you know look at how how stringent Obama was in his presidency\nWe didn't pass the dream act but now when I go around and I talk to people the number one thing that they always say is thank you for speaking or truth\nThank you for standing up for us that's always the first thing and the second thing is please don't back\nComing up on Latino USA the last thing my\nTold me before he

does she of course this has owned her power in her voice in this fear of electoral politics\nThere's another Latino owning her voice as a non traditional writer her name is Erica searches and her debut novel is called I Am not your perfect Mexican daughter in the novel she tells the story of ...\nAnd her ... to your relationship with her well meaning immigrant parents the novel is set in Chicago just like there it goes on life\nOr could join me in the studio to talk about how this novel mirrors her own experiences and her through her writing she's trying to dismantle the idea of like the nuts and perfection\nCircus inches welcome back to let you know usa thank you so much so Erica we had you on the show when you were working as a sex and love advice columnist or cosmopolitan for lifting us even though you really have been called the Latino\nBut she was a terrible writer [laughter]\nYou are an established poet from Chicago and the spotlight really shines on you when you write your first novel it's called I Am not your perfect Mexican daughter and the main character is Julie I'm\nRight or who do you tell us a little bit of butter sure it's a coming of age story one guy is a\nTroubled snarky Fifteen year old girl from Chicago\nAnd she is having a difficult relationship with her family particularly her mother I feel like a lot of immigrant daughters\nHave this contentious relationship with their mothers because it it's so difficult to understand one another and when I was growing up my mom and I were just always butting heads and I think\nA lot of it has to do with the fact that she grew up in ... in the middle of Mexico right and I was very very Americanized and and that's a common experience for a lot of brown women\nI find it interesting how many young Latinas now talk about the fact that they\nHad we'll issues around their ... their Mexican ness because the moms and dads were so kind of demanding and so they like pushed they actively pushed away they're ... they're Mexican is\nWell it's hard to negotiate that there's so much I Love about my culture I Love the fact that we're so family oriented and\nLike a million other things but there's a lot I don't love you know I don't like the massage Janine the patriarchy and and when I was growing up I pushed against those things and it created a lot of conflicts you know you use the\nTerm snarky to talk about your character who yeah it's not what you think of when you think of Latino celebrating their ... and wearing pink dresses like she's an American girl who's got an American teenage attitude\nYeah definitely and she's a lot of times very unpleasant and I think that's something that shocked people and I think that's interesting because\nHave you ever met a Fifteen year old girl I mean I was terrible yeah I was pretty terrible too yeah I mean you're angry at the world everything's soak 'em\nUsing and you don't know what to do with that anger so you take it out on everybody around you\nAnd so in fact you know cool yet in your book your character she's rude\nShe sarcastic off and she doesn't know when to stop talking what the it was important to create a character who is really difficult I think that we're not allowed to be flawed unfortunately\nAnd I'm really tired of that as a woman you know I I feel like\nI'm always expect to be pleasing and nice and sweet and polite and all of that and I'm not always that way you know and why are we allowed to be angry and to be fun to be a human being it's just\nIt's frustrating\nAnd let the ... for trade a docile and why it and yeah and who is not that way um she pushes against everybody she doesn't like anyone telling her what to do [noise]\nThis book when you were trying to get it published\nIt was rejected by some agents because that because what they didn't like the tone of the main characters\nI didn't like her voice and I said to myself well that's\nThe best part so I'm not saying you know and I took that as you know they were telling me that they didn't like the fact that this was a complicated strong Latino character I remember one rejection really was upsetting for me and I cried because it was really\nMean spirited and I just really upset I felt really discourage but again I felt like I didn't need to change the voice because I felt like that that's what made it special\nAnd so I just held out until I found someone who believed it and finally I did find an amazing agent who's been wonderful to me it all worked out so\nI think that's just a lesson for young women to just kind of stick to your guns\nAnd if you believe in something someone else was going to believe in it to\nA year has passed since the publication of the book and I'm a follower of yours on Instagram\nAnd so I was watching as like you know suddenly Erica Sanchez the poet has a novel and it's like constant smiles and you're getting recognition and it's just like oh yeah\nDefinitely two thousand and Seventeen ones\nJust wonderful like so many amazing things happened I was on the New York times list et cetera and news just a magical time\n[noise] and then\nTwo thousand any team came around and [noise] everything seemed to fall apart from me oh\nWent through a really really tough depression started\nEarly in the year and it lasted about six months\nThe most challenging time with my entire life and so how all these like wonderful things happen and all of a sudden [noise]\nI don't know everything just kind of\nAnd then all of a sudden you actually put on your Instagram ... tell us what you said on your instrument\nI wanted to be open about my struggles because it appears as if everything is magical for me\nUm but that's not really the keys you know even though I Am incredibly successful on like very grateful for that I still struggle with mental illness like success doesn't cure depression and so I went through this really dark\nTime and I just wanted people to know that\nThis happens and um that it's OK to ask for help and that it's okay if you're not okay and\nSo yeah I Know a lot of really beautiful responses to that I think people really appreciate vulnerability and I also talked about my recovery because I wanted people to know that it's possible\nTo to overcome issues like this it's it's possible to I don't think ... beat depression necessarily but to to live with it and to address it so what\nAre you trying to tell the young ... well anyone who reads the book but especially young ... ...\nYou know if you're looking at them straight in the eye if you're looking at a young Latino who's dealing with these feelings of like am I good enough I'm not a good Mexican I'm such an American girl like I'm so confused I hate my life\nWhat do you say to them I Want to know that I\nSee them\nThat I get it you know I Want them to feel understood\nAnd that's what I Want and when I was growing up I didn't really have a lot of literature that spoke to me in that way and you know I had a son of the season it does and I adored her but like that was it didn't have anything else and I wanted to write a book in which young women of color could see themselves and they could understand that it's okay\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect\nBoth in\nSociety and was in her family is and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that [noise]\nI Know that they exist [noise]\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\nThank you for putting it into words Erica Sanchez we really really appreciate your work thank you so much I really appreciate your interview\nErica ... Sanchez is the author of the New York times best selling novel I Am not your perfect Mexican daughter [noise]\n\nComing up on like you know you I said did you know the Dominican women graduate from college and higher rates than any other Latino demographic in New York City it's all about the data out data points can help us understand the future of young Latinos in New York and beyond stay with us it's not that I guess", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Austin", "day": "28"}
