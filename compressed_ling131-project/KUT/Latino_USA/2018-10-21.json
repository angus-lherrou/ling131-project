Bush took office as governor and since then Texas has voted consistently Republican for both state and national election Republicans currently controlled the state Senate and the state house of representatives ... and ... that's why today\nMany people feel a Democrat doesn't have a chance his Texas has been deep red for over Twenty years there have been challengers though Wendy Davis gave it a good shot she was a democratic Texas senator who became famous after nearly a half a day filibuster to block an anti abortion bill that\nStates that are that everyone is talking about Wendy Davis a Democrat took a stand against the bill restricting abortion in the state because\nShe ran for governor in last election cycle and lost to governor at at twenty point margin\nRight so if a democratic Darlene like Wendy Davis couldn't win in the state of Texas what really are the chances for sure if this\nWell remember she be seven people make it to the run off and she won in the runoff though\nWe are on a were consistent in victory\nIn fact even ... rent for sheriff of Dallas she was also the underdog but she won and won again four times in a row so she's\nA track record of of breaking barriers and shattering glass ceiling\nAnd some analysts say Texas really could turn blue state is getting younger and browner Latinos are expected to become the majority of Texans by twenty twenty two and while at the nose in Texas are a little more conservative than elsewhere in the nation they tend to favor Democrats\nIn fact some experts argue in the next presidential election Texas will be a toss up state [noise] and so all this brings us to one of the sheriff began talking\nPoints Texas is not a red state it's a non voting state if the people would vote we would when\nShe's right about the non voting part the seat has one of the lowest voter participation rates in the country and many of those non voters are Latinos\nTexas has the second largest eligible population of Latino voters nationally you'd only twenty seven percent say they will absolutely vote in the mid term election compared to sixty five percent for non Hispanic whites\nAnd for the sheriff to when she needs to get Latino voters out to the polls especially first time Latino voters and she thinks she can do it\nIf you give them something to vote for something they identify with there's a better possible as it does come up to her\nAnd she's even going around registering Latino voters one of the time\nWhat would they didn't put gas in your right and we saw this for ourselves and we stopped along I tend to get gas and the sheriff started chatting up the cashier or you are you a ... year he uses the cashiers name is ... and the value of\nLegislation for and it turns out she's an unregistered potentially ... or send it in the interest or not\nSo maybe a plus one for the sheriff well you know every vote counts right right so after this we hop in the car had to the next campaign event you stopped for lunch\nTrump to go through an immigration checkpoint or you can go now\nAnd arrive at the Mexican restaurant in Odessa\nCameras and reporters are waiting for the sheriff when we arrive every day\nTexans are struggling mostly she talks about economic issues things like college affordability and healthcare and she often brings up her own background as a child of poor migrant workers to help her message resonate\nI Know what it is to try and decide\nBetween a doctor or the rent\nWe step away and start chatting with some of the people who are at the event we walk over to an elderly trio and I asked them why do they like sure about that\nShe has a lot of great clouds who and women can do they think\nThis is Joan hurt she's here with her friend Mary Ann ... they're both lifelong Democrats in her seventies and eighties and like the sheriff they tell us there's more Democrats in Texas than you might think and they share a laugh with her about\nThis for the coming out of the cause of crafts do say that like wow I didn't know there was more Democrats are on Mm\n\nBut it was a little surprising to find that in a predominantly let me know city like Odessa that the people who came out to support her or the longtime older white Democrat\nNot the first time Latino voters she needs to turn out\nIf she wants to win [noise] and at her next campaign event this problem seems to get worse ... that's coming up with a device\n[noise]\n\nBless you know usa is on duty and I just want five in the league of women voters all scenario minds all the listeners election days November ... and early voting starts tomorrow league a free nonpartisan voter guide is available at public libraries and tries to county\nTell me a Democrat I Know where you're at where you stand and that is not where I stand\nPoint blank so your life Hi nice of you I don't even want to hear what you have to say\nWell what are the big reasons because Democrats are going so hard socialist there on a bashed now it's it's just it's just that's what big government let's do raise the taxes so we can say from the rich and give it to the war\nSo here lies the crux of the problem\nFor sure about this person that believes that her unique story of being the first gay Latino sheriff and the country will reach a broad range of Texans but he could end up having the opposite effect\nAnd turn off people from both sides even the largest police union of Texas is endorsing governor happened to\nA challenge from all areas they're challenging a show or the people we don't let the nose so are the people who don't like lesbian so are the people who don't like strong woman I get jealous when everywhere [noise]\nAnd so even if voters do come out for her in mass she also faces systemic challenges\nIn Texas voter suppression is a big issue according to the ACLU Texas voter ID laws disproportionately affect people of color a large part of sharp out as his base\nSo we're back in the car taking all of this into consideration as we're driving to the final stop for the day in Midland, Texas and\nI asked the sheriff there are people also say look Wendy Davis tried to do this she was something of an American political hero for a moment there she could not win the governorship\nWhat makes you think you can do this okay I came from the poor as it got to know the nominee for the governor of Texas that's a long ways to come and guess what\nThe little child end up buying the loan yeah in the ghetto in rural Texas tend to have that same opportunity there was an LA reporter who came over here right almost at the beginning\nOf her piece was\nLooping vote is even if she uses\nTexas when\nLive on this very well might lose this election she's down twenty points the share of herself says it's an uphill battle\nFestivals and concerts including one in Dallas with popular handled made or\n... which is the crowds of people there\nThe Pew Research center says the national voter enthusiasm this election cycle is at the highest level during any mid term in more than two decades especially for democratic voters so\nWho knows maybe there's still a chance the polls are underestimating her and that ... will surprise everyone and win or\nMaybe the Democratic dream of turning Texas blue will have to wait for another election\nMy thanks to Maggie freely for reporting that story with me\nNow we turn from the election for the governor's seat in Texas\nTo the governor's seat in Kansas\nKris Kobach is running on the Republican ticket for governor there\nWhat do I find so hard for Kansas after you look at the alley [noise]\nKris Kobach is running on the Republican ticket for governor of Kansas\nI Want my girls to grow up in Kansas that safe from crime and terrorism the do the taxes citizens to death and that has a\nCurrently he's the secretary of state of Kansas and if his name sounds familiar it might be because in recent years Kobach spin at the forefront of developing restrictive anti immigrant policies in the United states\n[noise]\nKobach was involved with drafting Arizona's infamous SP ten Seventy better known as the show me your papers law as well as a similar law in Alabama Kobach resume also includes helping to craft and defend anti immigrant ordinances\nFor a number of towns across the country an investigation co published by ProPublica and the Kansas City star found that cool boss made a lot of money doing this\nBut the town that hired him often didn't fare so well\nI'm joined by ProPublica journalist Jessica who's meant to talk about her investigation\nSo where did your kind of interest in Kris Kobach where did your interest begin\nI started covering elections right before the twenty sixteen election and he was sort of a a minor player in their twenties sixteen election and that he was one of those people that talked a lot about voter fraud but he wasn't that big of a deal and then as soon as he became\nThe commissioner for Trump's voter fraud commission I started paying very close attention to him\nPresident Trump launching a new connection on election integrity the move came after President Trump raised questions about widespread voter fraud and the two thousand fixing election\nHe is a person that just has very extreme ideas about the way voting should work who should be able to vote and I realize that the vast majority of his views on voting stem from his views on immigration\nIt's a no brainer if you really want to create jobs for Americans we need to start aggressively enforce our immigration laws and looking after our own citizens first oh\n\nSo tell us a little bit about Kris Kobach and his background like where is it that he starts getting these hard line views on immigration\nKris Kobach grew up in Topeka he was not like train of high school class and\nWent to Harvard and while he was at Harvard she studied under a professor\nWho had very extreme ideas on democracy I'm going to take a wild guess and say that that professor Samuel Huntington is Samuel Huntington\nHe thinks that I think he calls it the Latino is Asian of America and he says that that's going to lead to like a downfall of American culture and that person was Chris Cox mentor at Harvard\nSo how does it happen when you're looking into the background of course Kobach that you start making some connections around anti immigrant theoretical issues and Kris Kobach actually making money off of some of the policies that he ends up basically creating supporting\nRight so his first real job with government was after George W. Bush got elected he joined the department of justice\nAnd so he leaves the deejay and goes to work for a immigration\nGroup called the federation for American immigration reform that would be fair fair which is a very extreme group that advocates for limits on immigration and for radical alterations to refugee policy is among other things maybe it's time to face down immigration\nAs we can phase Americans back June before by origin for American immigration reform\nAnd so he went to work for them as an attorney but he leaves their to become secretary of state for cancer as fact during this whole time he is also trying cases across the country for towns who\nWant very radical immigration ordinances for their individual town\nElection day was a victory and farmers friends for supporters of ordinance winning I Know a lot of responsible ten in the U.S citizenship\nHazel ten ... farmers branch tax free mountain Nebraska valley park Missouri at\nThe day anyone renting a house or apartment in Fremont must pay five dollars for an occupying the apartment that only people in the country legally can get one\nPeople are moving out to pack up and leaving them and uh it's having the desired effect we want to have\nUsually the ordinances were already on the books and he helped them refine them and then defend them in court once they were ... we\nHave traced back all of the money that these cities directly paid Kris Kobach as a lawyer has a lawyer so over a decade we know that he made at least eight hundred thousand dollars\n[laughter]\nThese are all small towns whose demographics we're shifting and in some cases not even for real like in a valley park Missouri they think the Spanish population went from like one two three percent and that was enough to create this anti immigration sentiment\n[laughter]\nWhat Kris Kobach dead in the opinion of the local people that we've talked to there who ended up ... percent do this work with capitalize on that existing sentiment\n\nExample in valley park does not technically was\nChampioned play it like he he technically wanting valley park and it's like a very narrow way so long now he parks is technically on the books but the people who are there have told us one they've never enforce that and to they regret doing it\nAnd so he took that which is not that big of a when I went to farmers branch and went to a couple of other places and said look what I did for valley park I can do that for you too and then he used that when", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "21"}
