about that or at least trying to let go his latest release junk is a book length breakup poem it's the third in a series of which has been called contemporary ethics of rare brilliance let's welcome Tommy Pico the live wire [noise]\nWelcome to the show Tommy hey thanks for having me or this book\nJunk is the third in a series or you write about teams can you talk about the character of teams a little bit\nYeah so teams is my alter ego he's the version of me that\nIs always that attend the loudest the sexiest the the most pissed off you know um it doesn't take teams much to get a a motivated for any type of action right I'm I'm just way more buttoned up in that I'm actually kind of a prude like ...\nIs ... but the thing is like\nThe reason why I felt like I needed to create a persona was because I needed a way to detach myself from the work that I was making because if I thought it was about me I Would get too precious or I Would get to 'em so censoring so so that like\nI came off looking in a really good light whereas like teams is allowed to be dumb you know teachers allowed to make mistakes and to to not have the right answers and I don't feel self conscious about that\nDo you ever find yourself in real life being like hold on Tommy you're in teams town right now yeah absolutely\nThis weird as he leaves me every now and then um a lot of times on dates sometimes special times uh [noise]\nSo this character teams or what I understand you were writing about him in jeans when you were a kid what were you doing creatively when you were a you know when your teen years\nI'm ... my first so dizzy and collected was when I was in fifth grade it was called Tommy gun comics and I would get my cousins and my friends to draw comic strips for me I was Iraq them and I would sell them at recess for a dollar each [laughter]\nI'm I'm a little entrepreneurial back in the day I continue to street that's continued and then I'm In my teenage years I Would ... like sell them you know I'm outside of punk shows that I could have enough money to go to the punk shows and then later on when I was like maybe twenty six in Brooklyn I started in arts collective called the bird song collective\nAnd we were poets and and and non fiction writers and an essay is and and and short story writers and artists they would each give me something in every two months I Would have a release party and after five years we had like twenty issues\nAnd a nice little spot in the Brooklyn arts scene\n... you wrote a book another book that featured jeeps called nature palm and I think the one of the things brought up an is fascinating because as a as a Native American indigenous person or there's this assumption that you have this love affair with\nThe wind nature and that you just want to write about it but you've you write that that's not something that has always come super easy to you\nYes I mean essentially I guess I had to interrogate this idea of like what is my standing with nature right because there is like it's not that I don't mess with\nNature that's what I realize it's not that I hate nature although I kinda do hate nature and then [laughter]\nI live in the busiest cities in America like I'm not trying to be outside and go hiking you know it's a no offense\nYeah [laughter] yeah that's just me I'm not\nI'm not prescriptive about my lifestyle you can do what you want and I can do what I Want everything's cool um but there's this whole sort of western head a patriarchal white supremacist saying that tells me my relationship to nature right and I was trying to\nGive out all the colors of the wedding exactly\nI could accept nature but it's going to be on my terms you know as I can accept certain forms of identity I can accept a leather and feathers and be in all these things but it's going to be on my terms not terms that were made without me in mind\nOr in your bio you say that you sort of big grudgingly admit that Europe performer mhm what were you trying to avoid being a performer and your life\nNot necessarily I mean I I was crippling Lee shy I Believe that performance is partly um preparation and partly experience one\nOf them you have control over and then one of them is just a matter of time and I knew that all you needed to do was get on stage more often and that thing would come back to me whatever had been there when I was a child\nUm and that's why I started the arts collecting that I had a stage every other month to go on I hosted the readings and I read at them after five years I was All right but then after Fifteen Years of performing in Brooklyn I finally got to the point where I don't actually get nervous and actually I Do have a good time and I can remember all of it\n[laughter] we're going to take a quick break we are talking to Tommy Pico his latest book is junk this is live wire frumpy or I Will be back in just a moment [noise]\nK U T Ninety point five five ...\nThank you so much for listening\nTo

[noise] sure won't point our services list Sherman\nBut the thing that they all did is they invested themselves they decided\nThere was a huge problem and they were going to do something about it so for some students that meant\nShutting down the school shaming Derek every time they saw him slipping him off telling them to get the hell off campus and it was usually effective Derek\nMoved far away from campus he was really isolated he was sort of confronted for the first time with the true horror of a lot of the things that he believed in the eyes of his peers and then when these two Jewish classmates and the group that then widened invited him over he was much more likely to say yes 'cause he had nobody to hang out with\nSo he accepted this invitation and then I think\nThe persistent courage of many of these people to not just invite him over once but to invite him over a week after week after week sometimes with no sense that really they were making an impact on him\nAnd many of these students were were again the victims of these terrible things that Derrick and set and they printed out the awful things that he said about Jews were immigrants and posted them on the wall of their dorm room to remind themselves of how horrible these ideas were and yet they kept inviting them back\nAnd eventually that was partially a ... a big part of his transformation\nWhen did that change really start to manifest in dark black\nI think it it manifested slowly where like pieces of the things that he believed in but slip away other students on campus also armored themselves with the facts about you know racial science and\nCrime statistics all these all this fall science that white nationalist try to build their ideology around and they would argue Derek I'm the facts and he was smart enough to look at these studies and see that actually they were right so\nVarious parts of his ideas started falling away but the thing that was holding it in place\nIs that he knew eventually if he disavowed this ideology he was going to lose his family every piece of his identity every connection he adds in the first twenty three years in his life and he did I mean after very publicly disavow ing it he changed his name moved across the country and try to disappear in part for his safety because\nThe storm front community is not a great community to have angry at you neo Nazi skinheads I think they are a huge trader and but also because\nI Believe they referred to as some very fine people by the current president right [laughter]\nSo I guess I guess potato racist or just\nPeople on both sides of the Iraq yeah so um\nI I think Derek also hoped for a while that all of this off on this that he'd spread into the world he sort of naively thought maybe it will stay there maybe like I can just go on and live a life\nAnd be a good person and all of this stuff will disappear and\nIn this case you know often as a reporter I'm I'm sort of in the process of trying to convince people to talk to me over time for ... the thing that I think compelled him\nWas what was happening in the country I mean he saw all of these talking points that he had popularized spreading into the presidential campaign twenty sixteen ... you know it was it was David Duke and Don black who first with the KKK came up with the idea of building a wall on the on the southern border and took the national media there to drive around saying that\nImmigration was was changing the country and you know sort of playing to the sense of ownership this false sense of ownership that exists in these parts of white America\nWhen you read the book it it it just feels like you're in the heads of the individual what what do you have to do as a reporter to get to a place where you can write this is almost like an omniscient narrative and get into their heads in the hearts and people\nThat's really a nice easy to say I mean part of it is spending a ton of time with the people that you're writing about in building trust slowly so it Derrick the first time I met him uh\nWe met in this random city that I thought was his own town but in fact he'd have me come to a random place in case you want it to them disappear again you know he talked about people in his life in in sort of code names are\nBut trip after a trip building up trust showing that I was genuinely interested and I was invested in getting it right and\nTrust builds pretty quickly that you know I think my job as a reporter is often to build a relationship with people that establishes some trust and to ah\nTo listen and to show up again and again and to be genuine and the fact that I really care about what they're saying you know the other thing that helped a lot in this case is the book is based on essentially all these original documents and where I didn't have to ask people what they were thinking at the time I had\nThe archives of what they're thinking at the time because dark and his father on the radio every day there was storm front this huge archive message board and then luckily for me a lot of the people in the book are\nMillennials who document their lives relentlessly if I was like hey what was happening on his random Thursday in twenty Thirteen they would send me like two hundred G chat room at the end of the dialogue in the book\nCould be organic dialogue rather than me trying to recreate it and gas at what changed his mind\nWe're talking to us that slow his book is rising out of hatred it's about a dark black who are who dropped out of the white nationalist movement a he's a Pulitzer Prize winner ...\nUm what in in the time you spent looking into this movement or what do you think the sort of current state of it is I think a lot of us assumed that\nWhite supremacy and white nationalism and things like that we're going the way of the do do bird and then suddenly someone gets elected espousing a lot of the talking points and it's really upsetting and it makes me wonder are they getting sort of stronger and bigger and more influential\nYeah I mean I I think they are um and I think honestly part of the problem sometimes in America is that we have\nWe have sort of convince ourselves that things like white supremacy aren't aren't going away when in fact they're not and and and I think sometimes in America we tell ourselves a story of like we are a great meritocracy and everybody has the same shot which just the statistics and the facts don't bear out\nWhat I mean what are the rest of us the non sympathizers with that way of life other than inviting whatever white nationalist we meet\nOver [laughter] like what what can people do 'cause it's really scary thing to hear about yeah I mean I think uh\nI Would say the lesson for me and this was that you should confronted and whatever it weighs comfortable to you so for some people\nOn this new college campus that meant organizing protests and and you know\nForcefully in terms of civil resistance showing that this is not OK and\nFor other people it meant debating in a more academic way on the stats but I think we'd be lying to ourselves if we said we don't all have the opportunity in some way in our own lives to confront some of these really problematic ideas I Know that I Do I mean just in the people that are in my extended family and the problem\nIs giving us coming right [laughter]\nThat's true problem with these white nationalist ideas is that it would be comforting to think that it's a small number of fringe extreme is that who who are espousing some outside ideology the real problem is it's something that is much more widespread and pernicious and subtle that exists I think around many of us so\nI say when you see it it's an opportunity to do something about it at Derek at one point when we were talking about this book said something that stayed with me where he said you're for him the act of speaking up again and again that feels the central because in this moment being silent feels like being complicit and and I think is\nThat for the white [noise]\nHe likes ... new book is rising out of hatred and I thank you so much [noise]\n\nI Am so excited about our comedian this week she ... she's a\nBut on Comedy Central late night with Seth Meyers also on Conan she's also a writer on one of my favorite HBO series Barry which is about a hit man [noise]\nFinds that is true passion is community theater her new comedy album pasta will be out soon please welcome Emily hell or to live wire [noise]\nOh my gosh it's so\nGreat to be with you guys in the end times how's\nIn the [noise]\nIn a true sign of the apocalypse\nI joined a gym this year um [noise] I don't know what I think is pretty unusual reason I joined because at the age of thirty\nTwo I was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder\nMaybe soon I'll get my braces off get my period who know [noise] but I've been reading more about it you know when I'm short spurts and\nIf it turns\nThings that's supposed to really help with ADHD is regular exercise which was devastating news\nUm [noise]\nSo I joined a gym my gym membership came with a free personal training session and I was like oh well that sounds like that sucks a but it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do you're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part ways for the rest of our lives and he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear from that last thing I said\nThat I Do not have fitness goal my\nGoal was to join a gym and I did that already so I kinda feel like taking the rest of the year off if I'm being on a [noise]", "year":
