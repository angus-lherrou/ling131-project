just see that guy in the middle I'm like what do you do run [noise]\nPlus we meet a new fascinating friends unlikely hiker Jenny bruso\nYour music from force whether\nIt's a show that will delight you and one that gets started right after this new [noise]\nWas having a busy day and she could not give me the specific kind of attention I needed in a specific\nMoment on a Tuesday and then what if that was okay but if I could live in that universe or what if somebody listening to this radio show right now somewhere in America is like yeah\nThe live wire host those opening monologues those are pretty self obsessed\nAnd pretty boring [laughter]\nLike what if someone thought that hypothetically please don't let that be a real thing [noise]\nAnd I was still okay like what would that would would I feel like and so I've started asking myself this question\nWhen I get into situations that make me feel anxious or sort of bad feelings and I've been asking myself so much and it's been having such an impact that it started to become this like ... like I'm just going through life and something happens I'm like hey what if everything wasn't perfect and what if that was okay\nAnd I have to say like ... opened meditation apps not withstanding\nThis mantra has totally been changing my life like there are so many situations that I was in like the last month that I find myself in that previously would have\nTwisted me into a pretzel of bad feelings and now I just go hey what if everything's perfect and what does that is okay and my anxiety just like goes away\nAnd here's the crazy part even when I say the ... and it doesn't fix everything that's also a okay\nLove boom think about that smell me dog it's like [noise]\nThe perfect system because it's essentially foolproof so as you might be able to tell I'm very excited about this and I've just been going around telling any person who I run into about it and there's a person I Want to talk about uh with right now and they're here we're gonna bring him on stage let's get George Saunders out here [noise]\n\n\nGeorge welcome to live wire you you're a writer you're a teacher or your latest book Lincoln in the ... one one of the most prestigious prizes in all of literature watch it happen\nThey really happened\nThe man Booker Prize\nWhen you found out you one that did it bring you true inner happiness right away yes [noise]\nRight away you know George Saunders every once in a great having him [noise]\n[noise] I\nI notice that there's a you know there's a good part and that's for me as a person with career low self esteem is kind of like a pat on the back like you wrote a weird book\nPeople like to do and do it weirder one you know that's a good part and then and there's a negative part which is kind of like on the principle that did you eat a lot of beans you're going to get friday and bloated so when you get a lot of attention ... you know you're going to get friday and bloated [laughter]\nAfter you got the news we're just ... you just felt so good and happy and like nothing could touch you\nYeah relatively I think so yeah I mean I've I'm you know I've learned to kind of separate out there's a wave of something good or bad that comes to you and you can kind of work through it like this is a good part there were helped me do the next book this is the bad part that you know and award shows they always say I'm humbled\nTotally the opposite in your your entire [laughter] so I think part of it is to kind of ... and this is actually something I learned from writing which is there's an essential\nEnergy and every moment like in your story or in that moment of winning\nIt washes over you son was good for you so much bad for you and you have the the right as you were talking about the model to kind of just look at it and say I'll take that I don't want that part I interviewed Bill Clinton one time and ask them about I'm not a a graceful interviewers are kind of asked him about the Lewinsky years [laughter]\nI really did he know that you were going to ask him about who\nWas that he just oh yeah that was rough time and but he said um [noise]\nWhat do you have this amazing advice\nAbout a criticism which I think he actually from Hillary which was when when something no shit when somebody criticizes you\nYour posture all stance towards it should be wide open let it hits you don't go into a defensive crouch because that's kind of a courageous thing to do sometime later you'll notice that certain things are sticking certain ideas are still living\nThose are the ones that actually came from inside you you know so then you'd be really crazy not to take that the good advice that actually came from inside you and was kind of awakened by this exterior criticism\nHow much of your work on you've written a amazing short stories and Lincoln the bar does or is your first novel how much has happiness been a theme and your work or made its way into your work\nWell you know it's there's a I think it's just been Marshall and said happiness Royce writes white so it's harder to do functionality and happiness and love and she is actually just technically harder for some reason so my early books because of that and also because I was living kind of a a little bit of a hardscrabble life\nTended to be dark or they're more dystopian and kind of a illustrating that jury equals an idea that a capitalism ponders the sensuality the body you know that was kind of um hadn't\nForget where I was\nWhen I did [laughter]\nSo for me the challenges I get older as it is to try to be technically more proficient so I can actually get that the beautiful stuff of life in there without being ... 'cause my life has been great you know we have ... kids that are grown and it's been lovely but that's hard actually is certainly hard to represent that stuff but just as valid as the dark stuff\nWell I I'm Wondering about that because you've been so successful I mean your your books are amazing the nonfiction stuff you've written has been it's been really great as well and and you you had a you've got a a Guggenheim or I Believe and this man Booker is there any danger of like the George Saunders of this era who's been getting a lot of a claim\nLosing touch with the George Saunders of the previous era who's writing all this stuff that everybody loves\nPercent because you know what I found is as you move away from misery you assumed that misery\nIs it ever acceptable to ignore someone's call and then just text them back [laughter]\nYou know I Do I sure why not [laughter]\nI think I just would like to this ignore both generally and really find them in person that's got to do you uh\nSo I mean are you a person who's still talked on the telephone because I feel like when people call me it is an act of aggression at this point\nI Would I find is\nThe impulse is to always answer was attacks and I'm as I'm getting older and like you know there's that moment where you could decide to call it's always better to call\nI think always better because it's you know it's human and so scary and you you can give off a lot of signals that you can't given tax you know what is your policy on ... I Love 'em I just discovered ... are you know gifts and I'm going nuts I don't even [noise]\nI mean even tired words anymore it's just [noise]\nDogs sniffing cats ass as an so on [noise]\nYou know they have rescinded the man Booker Prize before [laughter] so you just might want to be careful that if you\nGo all and mostly all the time they actually have taken away I don't know\nI I just ... a little ghosts with a tyranny on his\nFace [laughter] those are very good answers thank you for answering the germ sure that that should come on the show George Saunders everybody\nLive wire is brought you buy Alaska Airlines an airline that doesn't just lie lumberjacks into ... with twelve hundred daily flights in over one hundred Fifteen destinations in the U.S Canada Mexico in Costa Rica ...

bread in her mind are put on a plate not eat\nAnd then you see your girl walk across the room knew like I should treat women better [noise]\nNow when you're in a restaurant someone goes to the

it is I just see that guy in the middle I'm like what do you do what is it every day he doesn't time at right what happens [noise]\nSure they're just headed the lunch I Know but still who wants to be in the middle no money\nMaybe it's just me as you get older you should think about the simple things you know what's been bothering me lately I I was looking at my local coffee shop to see if there were open 'til eight and I saw like a one star review at the bottom of the page and I was like let me see what this is all about and I open it and this woman wrote this review and it went like this\nI was in the neighborhood and I needed a caffeine picks boy was that a mistake [noise]\nI went in here and they were so rude to me the last day was fine but they were so rude I'll never go back I don't even live in this neighborhood but if I did I'd never do and I suggest you never go either\nYou want to take down a business because someone was nice to you when did that become a thing that people had to be nice to you you go to a mechanic 'cause he's nice to you know you got a good ... move on\nAnd when did it become that all of a sudden order coffee guys rude that you go\nWow I'm not going to say anything now\nBut when I get to my car I'm gonna tell everyone [noise]\nWhy can't you be the beacon of light you know what I mean why can't it be like hey I order copy guys rude and then you go back and go hey\nWhat's going on what do you get the Mondays on a Thursday I feel it that's no good no good\nIf he still road that's when I pull up a two dollar bill that I always carry and I'd like before you make that what's this let's do going in the ... ... what am I your great uncle I'll see over there [noise]\nI think everyone just needs to go to a really bad play or any play [noise]\nAnd then leave there and just appreciate that people rehearsed for six months they rented a theater they printed tickets and that's what it was if you can appreciate\n[noise] [noise]\nI like that twenty five people that's a good crop as sort of [noise]\nIf you can appreciate something that's not perfect you can't appreciate diversity or love or people or women you know [noise]\nThat was fun at the end wasn't it\nHaven't you seen the current climate [noise]\nWhat I'm saying is you're never going to endure a marriage if you're looking for it to be perfect if you get what I'm saying because I married and she's not\n[noise]\nLet me just tell you something about men and women that it's a myth men are much more sensitive than women or\nMy wife sleep like this like a court like theft is coming and she's fine with it I sleep like this like somebody who loves me and it's not going to be her because she doesn't like the total [noise]\nYou know I recently got his it inside my nose and I said to my wife I'm like I can finally understand what childbirth painted light\nJust based on the right here [laughter]\nI'm Jay Larson you guys thank you very much [noise]\nJailers and welcome to a live\nWire man thanks for having me I Love this um which kind of talking about happiness this hour and I'm Wondering have you ever met a stand up comic who seems genuinely happy nah not really [noise]\nThat's how we find humor in the dark as spots of the world\nWhat is that I mean if I'm getting there are some very happy people especially when you get off stage if you have a good show because you're when you can bring laughter to people you know hopefully it makes people feel good I think a lot of comedians have like a very dark past things that have happened and they when you can see the bottom of this\nThe the pet you know what I mean you can always find ways to like navigate to get to the top I Would think I don't know\nHow much of like your act and in your view on life is affected by your child if you grew up near Boston you did grow up with four kids single mom\nI was the youngest of four yeah we had a very um my mom was a very interesting woman we went to we didn't have like cable television we went to the theater and we went to museums and my mother worked at a ballet and everybody had to play an instrument and I was around a lot of art and when we weren't doing art we were sitting in parks watching people\nBecause that's what my mom would do you watch the ball\nAnd when your age you like what [laughter]\nBut now I'm older like we would go from mystery rise and you don't have a lot of money you y'all hopping the Chevy that blows purple smoke when the depress won't work and you drive through alleys with no headlights on and your mother says\nYou're right and you're like where are we and she's like\nWe're in a shopping center but you don't know where we are\nAnd now I like I appreciate and love that that's how you know that's what we have you know\nUm you you also have a you've written for television I Know that you have projects that are in development and you act\nAs well ... ... is there one of these things that you like you feel like you have a sort of special aptitude for are you a standup comic who actually are you an actor who got in to stand up comedy\nI'm a human being who so lost in this world I Will do anything for the appreciation of other people [noise]\nWhen it comes down to [noise]\nI Know every single day I'm like I just stopped doing stand up I I it's the most shallow for you know it's like a very sometimes is good and then like acting is something that's fun but I don't really think I'm that good honestly I don't think anyone's that good I think ten percent of people will act or good everyone else's again who can everyone can do that [noise]\nThat's just the facts that Daniel Day Lewis and then there's like All right everybody else you know what I mean [noise]\nI mean let's be honest\nI'm so acting as whatever um I really enjoy writing but it's a lot of work no one really wants to work that hard ultimately if I could do anything I Would open\nUp a little general store and like I have a bell on the door and I'd serve coffee in the morning and I'd pick up my kids from school and then like make dinner and they go back to the store and then you know you know like", "year": "2018", "show_name":
