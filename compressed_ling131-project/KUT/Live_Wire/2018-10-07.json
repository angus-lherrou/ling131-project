D. one often thank you so much for listening right now it's eighty one degrees here in Austin they say forty percent chance of thunderstorms going into tonight we're expecting a low uh Seventy two and then starting Sunday we have a forty percent chance of thunderstorms in the morning\nAnd thirty percent into the evening it ... out in about ... ... let's see\nLimits that's coming up at the top of the hour here his wife ...\nFrom ... our radio international [laughter] [noise]\nIt is featuring that guy you just heard and as magnificent voice\nWhat we're going to ask a hard question is brunch destroying America\nYou know basically what you're doing is you're taking one of the two days off were your entire\nRico galley uno says it is ... you can Mitch\nNow we're going to learn to Andy handler is no fan of that saying\nOf a sociopath or you\nAny way we have a great show for you and it starts right after\nOn one side of the argument was my mom on the other side was the entire family which is about thirty people\nAnd she did not budge\nThe most amazing part about this argument was that it unfolded while we were watching the movie elf starring will Farrow [noise]\n\nTo this day she has never admitted that as the star of that movie\nSo this is this is in my DNA it's so entrenched in me this feeling of not wanting to admit when I'm wrong that when we watch jeopardy and by the way I I I said we because I Do not watch jeopardy alone because if I get the right answer and nobody is there to hear it did it even happened [noise]\nWelcome to my brain it's a very sad place\nWe're watching jeopardy I Will yell out the answers and when asked her back gives a different answer I Will argue with him under my breath\nUntil the next question that I happen to get right which is usually from ... for some reason that seems to be kinda my sweet spot so\nI bring a lot to the table in terms of being annoying and in terms of doing things that should probably be contradicted I Will say this the one area of my marriage that I feel like I've actually made some progress in this and that is when we are driving together\nBecause my wife let me start by saying is a really good driver and she has a really good sense of direction a much better sense of direction than I Do and even so when we're in the car and she is driving roughly one thousand times per minute I disagree with whatever decision she's making\nThe road she's taking the light she's not gunning for it's a constant series of thoughts of my head about how she should be doing it differently and for many years I shared those thoughts with her [noise]\nIt came to its I kind of um I guess I don't know if you want to say Hi point or low point but it reached some sort of a an apex\nAbout six months ago we had an entire date that was ruined because of the argument we had in the car going to the date\nAnd it was about a choice of road the difference being like a minute or two and I got home that night and I was like something's gotta change and so I decided that\nI was going to really rethink how I was in the car and I enacted something in my own mind I titled the code of silence\nI just decided that I was not going to at any point comment in any way about anything related to the driving when she was driving and so I started this code of silence and something incredible happened we took so many wrong turns [noise]\nI mean like insane amounts of wrong turns\nI probably spend an extra six hours at red lights that we could have got through that they were yellow\nWe definitely got on the freeway going north and we wanted to be going south like three times\nAnd also it has been the best six months of my life [noise]\nBecause I realized it doesn't matter right like it's not that big of a deal we're going to get where we are going and all of a sudden now I like enjoy being in the car with my wife we like\nHold hands and we like to talk about our lives and we listen to music and it's like I it's like night and day so here's my plan for twenty Eighteen I Want to try to take that principle and apply it to the other areas of my relationship so I Want to use that same approach for questions of like when the Greek yogurt gets thrown out\nOr if both of the pets need actual birthday parties with presidents and hats\n[noise] do they understand that I Would say no but whatever\nI'm really going to try to change some of these things I'm going to keep you posted on how it's going okay [noise] well [noise]\nI did this is true I did buy some lower ... light bulbs\nFor the TV room [noise] I did not put them in yet but I bought them before I made this decision so they're grandfathered in so\nI just want to say that's er [noise]\nLet's get our first guest out here they are beloved radio hosts and now they're authors who\nAre staking their professional reputations to the extremely contrarian take that brunch yes brunch that favorite activity of the Portland leisure class brunch is ruining America\nTheir new book is brunch is hell how to save the world by throwing a dinner party please welcome Rico galley on and Brendan Francis noon him the live wire\nRefund Brandon welcome to live wire thanks for having thanks for having us but um I Want to just warn you you know this book is is pretty critical of brunch and here in Portland you are really behind enemy lines\nRecognize a ... to just put their arm around you and like Jack Nicholson styles they face it this is brunch town\nI think I saw people waiting in line for brunch on the way here like four or five hours early yeah I think there I saw scrambles in their eyes for\nA man in in your professional opinions or end as authors of this book why do you think brunch as hell\nLet me start by saying we were tweeting about ... today and some guy said yeah but it's a great for hangovers and I want to know what part of waiting in the sun on the sidewalk for like an hour for a seat than going inside spending Eighteen dollars on eggs\nHaving a very weak orange juice but most of the thing now you're very tired and you such um what part of that is ... pain is it ... it doesn't make any sense\nWhen you say it like that it does sound kind of ...\nIt sounds weird and bad does what it is and and uh you know basically what you're doing is you're taking one of the two days off that you've worked your entire week to have in your stabbing it in the heart [noise]\nThat seems to be kind of the primary argument against brunch seems to be that it is a real a torpedo duty submarine that is your day yes that explained Brandon well it's just I mean he captures it perfectly in that um\nThe Judy with a surprisingly practical contrarian opinion actually money conquers way more than love most days [noise]\n\nUh Gregg says their country an opinion that nobody else buys into hybrid and electric cars can't be trusted there too quiet what are they up to [noise]\n\nI'm going to withhold this person's name because I Do feel like they could come under\nA real threat a physical danger particularly here in Portland this person's most contrary an opinion no dogs at all [noise]\n\nSuccess it's a contrary an opinion that not many other people agree with [noise]\nOur next guest career as a writer seems contrary to whatever the supposed rules of doing that are her books the small backs of children and the book of Joan are best sellers her latest is the misfits manifesto which started as a Ted Talk which now has over two million views\nI just have to say I watched it yesterday at my house and I just basically started sobbing at my desk get is that powerful um I have now got myself together I'm happy to say and were overjoyed to have her here please welcome to live wire Lydia ... which [noise]\nLydia welcome to live wire my pleasure\nOr I have to be honest I don't know if I even really believe in TED Talks anymore or do I like sometimes they just feel like somebody wanted to give a Ted Talk so they came up with some supposedly clever way to think about the world and yet I watched your Ted Talk\nYesterday and it just totally destroyed me in a good way excellent is that\nI mean had what kind of reaction have you been getting to this well part\nOf my jam is that I make people cry [laughter] really [laughter]\nNot necessarily meaning to I Know what you mean about TED Talks on the one hand they seem like soundbites of cleverness but then the other thing I was thinking about is that with TED Talks nobody is the perfect\nExpert on everything because there are ten million ways to hear a story or think about something and it kind of democratize is different truth instead of claiming there's one way to think about things\nSomeone I thought about it that way I was able to get on the stage but then they put me on the stage after John Legend and I almost die\nThat's how that's John them tough warm up act [noise] yeah it was not the used\nCar dealer John Legend but the Grammy winning nationally famous singer John Legend heaven or nine Grammys jeez Louise how long did you work on that Ted Talk\nI think about seven months of practicing I'm I'm In ... river like hardcore ... so I'm practicing alone in the room\nWith a computer of people watching me telling me what I'm doing well or not well way way way\nWhere they with the Ted organization or is this is like a webcam situation [laughter]\nIt was Ted folk it was the most strange alien experience of my life and occasionally I just run out of the room and hide in the bathroom [laughter] and they wait for me to come back [laughter]\nOr we are talking to Lydia ... which are are seen as we can live whereas on the contrary I'm your memoir the chronology of water a talks a lot about your experience as a competitive swimmer and you're still the if your website is to believe you're still one hell of a swimmer what makes you so good as swimming\nA v.'s ... because my stroke was butterfly and I'm One of those people who who is very awkward and physically bumbling in the world is there anyone else in the audience besides me who's physically we please make us our\nThe more efficient ways to ask the one person who's not to raise their hand\nJust way faster that way\nBut if you put me in water I'm I'm weightless or doesn't matter if I'm beautiful or not it doesn't matter what my successes are failures are I'm just a mammal in water and it's OK\nDid it always feel that way 'cause you're a very competitive swimmer as a as a young young person yeah\nBut I never cared about winning I just happened to be good at something and writings the same way for me I I happen to be able to swim in language the way I happened to be able to be in water I came from a home that was dark and not great like a lot of you and swimming got me out of the house\nAnd saved my life [noise]\n\nOr their points in your writing work and you're writing career where any of that sort of swimming experience and discipline and what have you informs how you write\nEvery day I'm particularly not so much swimming pools that ocean waves\nSo I'm not a disciplined writer in addition to being an introvert or I Can't write every day and so one day I came up with the idea because I'm a water person that the metaphor of a wave you know the surge they get big they come they crash they come all the way through your feet gently\nAnd then they go way back to the ocean to build energy kinetic energy that's how I write when I figured that metaphor out I thought I'm going to be okay 'cause I'm a wave\nAnd that works for me so maybe I write every day for four days maybe I don't write for a month or two maybe I go on a three they binge writing thing and when it's coming it's the wave and when it's not it's going out building ideas\nCan you remember when it started to crystallize and your mind this idea of the waves as opposed to the more conventional way of doing this yeah the Ted Talk really yeah because I didn't die\nIt's not a joke [noise]\nI uh I literally thought I was gonna die and my husband was with me and he was in the audience and they looked at 'em right when they called my name after John Legend [noise]\nTo go up on the stage I looked at him for support you know my rock my love my soul mate Eighteen years and the look on his face is you are so aft\n[noise]\nBut the thing is I didn't die\nAnd when I came out of it which you know it took me about two weeks to even comprehend that that it happened and I was still me in my life [laughter]\nUm I started hearing from other people and I realize the reason to do it wasn't for me at all and the reason to do it was to remind us that all of our stories matter\nEven the quiet people even the people who are ... even the people who\nMess it up daily our stories deserves some light on us too and when I realize that I started to fighting the way right as okay [noise]\n\nYeah as as a person who\nHas had lots of big plans in the back of their mind and lots of things that have moved from the front burner to the back burner to the side burner to the front burner in terms of complements in projects I found that Ted Talk and then the subsequent book the misfits manifesto I found them just to be so\nComforting because it's so easy to beat yourself up about particularly you're talking about creative stuff\nThe stuff you're not doing and I feel like this is the best I've ever read it at helping lower my anxiety about all this\nI'm not doing now if I die having never done anything I blame you [laughter]\n'cause you gave me permission but at least right now I'm In this list out like three day period where I'm like feeling like I was still my habit higher I kind of an because I mean one of the things you talk about is that you got by the way we are talking to Libya you know which uh her latest book is the misfits manifesto this is like where radio one of the things you talked about\n'em in the Ted Talk is that you had this one this contest you won the chance to go to New York and to meet with all of these incredibly powerful literary agents and publishing houses right right and all this stuff and it was really happening for you and yet\nIt took you ten years more before you actually followed up when these people who are more or less begging you to to be able to represent you or to get some pages from you what happened in those ten years\nWell and the opportunities came to me I was in my twenties like twenty five and when this big writing cries and I got to go to New York and meet all these amazing agents and editors and so it was kind of being offered to me on a beautiful place but where I was in my life was in a place where all I felt was a sad\nQuiet stone my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me it took ten to Twenty years for me to stand up inside the thing that was being handed me the front of me and to say you know I might I might be able to stand up inside this too\nAnd so I'm kinda here to remind any of the rest of you that uh we all deserve a place at the table and it doesn't matter what shape it takes and we're not all going to look like celebrity culture", "show_name": "Live Wire", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "07"}
