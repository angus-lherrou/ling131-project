I'm doing the same exact thing was take a\n\nTest test again then test again\nThat became Carmen ... test pregnant women early and often she believes women deserve options\nMy responsibility as to provider is to have that conversation you know you can continue or interrupt your pregnancy it is your choice you needed diagnoses too hot that decision because I watch anything either but you don't want you to come\nSix months from now and tell me that you've never had an option because nobody told you about it\nMost people who get sick I don't have any symptoms so the only way to know which babies are exposed is to test\nEach had double actually triple job\nI'm also concerned about public health so slowly ... indeed like health future of the country and there's some ...\n[noise] [noise]\nDuring our first meeting Carmen talking a lot about how bad the economy was how many doctors were leaving the island to practice on the mainland still Puerto Rico was ahead of many places when it came to ... all pregnant women retested and for babies who were born with a virus the government set up a system to track them for\nThree years and all this was free by two thousand Seventeen\nPuerto Rico was tracking four thousand babies with the gun then in September\nCame Hurricane Maria said was a hundred and sixty five and now the national Hurricane Center\nFor me the way to show up for retail for ensuring warning\n\nI tried reaching comment on the phone when the storm hit\nIt took me two weeks\nShe told me it was like the island had been hit by a nuclear bomb and she was exhausted from working around the clock now wearing a\nMuch more situation only six percent of people have power right now sixteen days after the game where we're going to survive on ...\nEven though her hospital was barely functioning it was one of the few open and Carmen was delivering more babies than ever thirty percent more than usual\n... collapsed I Swear I step our system as a communication system and we're only dealing with emergencies so anything that she was dean like all their babies born from women infected with the ... evaluation that stopped and\nIt will not me ideas maybe weeks from now that these services was surely start\nA me knowing and and name them and\nWeeks and that's how long Carmen thought it would take for the island to recover enough to start thinking about the again\n\nAfter that first call I checked in with Carmen at least once a month and on each call she told me the same thing there was no word from the government about restarting seek a testing for pregnant women\n\nSo in the spring of two thousand Eighteen six months after the hurricane I went back to Puerto Rico to find out what was going on\nThere was no she got this thing ever done since September to south since Seventy see if they hear it so we have no way of knowing if we are still having transmission are not\nDoctors could still draw blood to testify physique huh\nThere wasn't much point to it that's because they were being told the government health lab that performs the test was closed for business not only that this is when officials announced that does he get crisis was over that there were no new cases of ... on the island it was like we had been swept away by the hurricane\nThey ... they ... the firemen which by the way it's no longer there I check yesterday they do have safe I made a website to see whether they had any secrets that these states nothing they have nothing there now it's only they all have reports\nCarmen couldn't believe it the government was saying there were no new cases of the ... after the hurricane but Fifteen hundred pregnant women had been diagnosed earlier that same year\nDr she works with couldn't believe it either Dr Cynthia Garcia Cole is a clinical psychologist who spent Seventeen years teaching child development at Brown university\nI mean if you don't test for ... how are you going to know how many people are being infected\nBefore the storm Cynthia spent a year traveling to government health centers around the island gathering data ... babies after they were born the ones that government is following for three years\nDo you feel like they're gonna have to file you\nOh boy a good one\n[noise] uh this point the program that I was part of monitoring the development of children born to\nSeek out exposed pregnancies within the department of health we have they stopped\nCynthia tells me the government fired her and took all of the data she'd collected\nShe says they didn't give her a reason for letting her go and health department wouldn't tell us either\nAfter Cynthia stops working for the government she teamed up with Dr ... and they're monitoring children on their own without holding Cynthia focusing on babies who were exposed to Zika but Moran\nLooking completely normal babies like Kimberly hanging\nOut okay you're emphasizing the locals say oh yeah right so what we're doing here is the baby scale so he hadn't development\nKimberly a seven month old and because today is actually her seven month birthday her grandmother do they're up in a fancy dress and a headband with one giant bow that seems to say I don't have hair but I Am a girl\nLittle statement\n\nAnd then the uh looks like a kid herself exaggerating her expressions and practically climbing under the table it looks like she and Kimberly are playing\nBut everything Kimberly does how she reaches for the rental how she holds it the way she tries to squirm off the table it's all a test trying to answer one question is she able to do what's expected of a seven month old now for the most part yes but\nI noticed that you know it's there's a little ... here in terms of self regulation is what I just notice so far\nAs you have in mind sharing data to these asks what is you know Jay and\nYeah there's a very wide range some kids are doing really well and some kids are very compromise I think a lot of small motor the maze moving your hands\nThe lay ceding the lay walking\nThese kinds of exams are crucial because if a doctor notices that have babies motor skills aren't developing the way they should they can start therapies to help the baby\nStudies like this also help researchers understand how ... works yes they can cause massive problems like microcephaly but it can also cause more subtle neurological issues trouble swallowing walking seeing\nAnd I made that there hasn't been that many studies on this kid and the samples right now thinks that same publisher thirty kids you know forty kids ten\nAnd we have two hundred we have over two hundred so that's why we think this data is really important to publish\nBut it's not clear if this study will ever see the light of day the health department needs to authorize publication and so far it's refused to do so\nI told them that I've made in that we had I said I can leave here being completely unethical\nIs those who were you talking to and you said your officials from the department of health that were in charge of this seek a monitoring system yeah now I I've never seen politics getting involved on on research\nNo way that this looks like [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI've wanted to understand the politics behind ... ever since I started following it two years ago and I did everything I could think of to talk to someone from the health department at first I called [noise]\nLike [noise] I mean\nWhen I showed up at their offices again and again\nThe problem is I mean I've been to the office many times now in person and also called\n... finally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago\nWe meet in the hallway of the convention center where she's speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis is over\nA so far we are not that they think Neal case uh the guy on our state epidemiology [noise] they'll son expect to have cases right now\nShe's a pastor and real estate agent [noise]\nWhen I Walk inside hemp taking a phone call from a client\nThat morning and family helped\nHer desk is covered and paper and folders and posted notes walking clients are constantly coming in and out and as soon as she gets off the phone just rang again\n[noise]\nBut more to him and helping\nAs the client talks on the phone hands scribbles on a yellow legal pad\nOkay when can you are coming in to do that patient what nine pm here until nine PM I hadn't been off is hardly even as late as ... you know because they're not talking about it and using more\nThan me if you're going on\nHands than hearing from a lot of flood victim and besides wanting a place that won't flood again pretty much everyone who called or drops in has one request [noise] you know I'm trying to be in a better area for myself for my kids have um like I Want to\nHave a long haul\nLabor like you're going to be\nOne of those clients is a woman named Denise Taylor she's from Chicago and she reached out to him on line just a couple of months before the hurricane when she was thinking about leaving Denise did not feel safe in her old neighborhood and she wanted her daughter Christie not to go to a better school to meet\nIt's the backgrounds on the west side of Chicago is just African Americans and Hispanics [noise] that's it and I try to find that it's not normal fester phenomenal what where can I take her to really see it\nLike most of ... clients Denise have something that's supposed to help her get what she's looking for it's called the housing choice voucher also known as the section eight voucher\nA government benefits that helps low income people pay rent [noise] about twenty thousand families in the Houston area use these vouchers the program was designed to be this ticket to a better neighborhood maybe a better life it's federal money you can use the voucher anywhere in the country\nOn the last day of July in twenty Seventeen Denise and Christie and I got into therefore focus hatchback and drove from Chicago to Houston they hardly knew anyone there except him\nSo I said when you come down you can stay with me why you decided on some\nSome of the world's going to do to end up no by she could have been killed but again you know what I'm saying a lot of ... the only thing I got here you can have as close as opposed to blow you left me a key my first day I was gone I woke up\nAnd I was like she just bust here and there was a key to stay at home\nIt didn't take long for needs to find a job at a pharmaceutical plant packing and shipping but just\nA few weeks after she moved in with him Harvey hit and Denise as housing search suddenly got way tougher Harvey damaged more than forty percent of Houston houses and apartment buildings there was a lot more competition for what was left and the vouchers\nExpire in as little as two months if you don't find a place in times so she had the phone [noise]\nMy name is Denise out of hiding a reference to your apartments you have ...\nThe nieces voucher would let her rent a two bedroom apartment costing up to fourteen hundred dollars a month with the government paying maybe half of that she found plenty of apartments within that price range neighborhoods she liked\nAnd my next question is do you guys take the housing choice voucher so you do or you don't at all okay that's okay thank you [noise]\nDenise made dozens of calls like this everyone said no a month after Harvey hit and then two months Denise was still staying with him and apartment manager's we're still telling her no\nIn some parts of the u._s. it's illegal to reject around her just because they have a voucher it's considered discrimination that's not true in Texas though which I'll explain more later\nIf is degrading and if you're not morally if you're not built up morally it can really puts you on a you know depressed kind of safe like when\nI you know it makes you put yourself in a category that you're not in\nOne out of every four families in Houston that receives a voucher never gets to use it that's according to the Houston housing authority Denise was worried she'd have to give her back\nWhy don't you take section eight what's wrong with sex right\nDenise thinks this isn't about her voucher she thinks it's because she's black like most about your holders\nRan the numbers and found that almost Ninety percent of families and the Houston area without trees are African American most of them live in areas with the city's highest poverty rate the way that he sees it she's deliberately being steered toward the poorest and most racially segregated neighborhoods [noise]\nLocal housing officials recognize that this is a problem and ... is actually one of the most\nSegregated cities in the country\nA few years ago the Houston housing authority tried to take a small step to address the issue it didn't go well\n\nOfficials had this idea to build a mixed income apartment building in a wealthier part of town called the Galleria it's known to this giant\nGlitzy mall with an ice skating rink [noise]\nSome of the units in the building would have to accept vouchers getting poorer families access to better squirrels\nBut hundreds of angry he's donations revolted here for\n[noise]\nBack in twenty six teams they showed up in force to a public meeting at the neighborhood elementary school it was standing room only lasted for hours [noise] almost all the people in the crowd were white they complained that the building was too expensive way overcrowded schools lower property values\nOf four\nOr more [laughter] [laughter]\nOh [noise]\nPeople's unwritten comments to one person complained about what they called Hulu shouldn't upscale neighborhoods with the poor only a few people smoke\nUp in favor of the proposal including a woman named ... most of\nThese really rooted fear\n... black and she works for a housing advocacy group she told the audience the people who want to live here are your janitors your ... your wait staff\nSo we want to\nSay you're ... you're not [laughter]\nWhen this whole debate was going on Pamela banks was watching it unfold and thinking about our clients these apartments could have helped them\nIf they could move that neighborhood with a voucher they could get a leg up but the project was killed not long after that public hearing I called him recently and later some of the tape\nThe part where the guy talks about compassion for people who need affordable housing but also that poison grapes him told me\nIt made her think about how after the hurricane people set up animal shelters on that side of town\nIn the gallery you ... shows just out there for you and your name is\nThere's a reason pan is saying we and us here for her it's personal in her late twenties after she and her husband separated him landed in Houston as a single mom she applied for a section ... voucher and waited for seven years to get one\nWhen she finally got her voucher back in Nineteen Ninety seven Pam spent months searching for a place that would take it one day she came across this lifting a brick house with a fireplace in the suburbs in an area known for better schools so she drove out there to meet the landlord\nIt was raining I got out there and it was the youngest and America later than a BMW she got out toward the house\nHam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave she went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\nSaid okay that's it and I have housing and I know you may or may not know about housing neo stereotype image but take this other friend about it and let me know if you want to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after pan and the kids move than she bought her own house [noise]\nThis is why Pam does this work today why she's trying so hard for Denise can Cook County Illinois where Denise from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter the she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take out or it's as she got that", "year": "2018", "show_name":
