[noise]\nBrian Kemp is in a tight race for governor of Georgia he's also the secretary of state there overseeing elections can facing allegations of voter suppression\nThere are people on the left literally have called me the secretary of suppression they don't why they wouldn't have her Motorola schooling\nKemp set of threatening letter to hell in Kim hope after she registered minorities to vote like scared you know um and then pass so she turned to Atlanta attorney who's been defending voting rights for decades wrote if you want to you guys hear K corral\nYou came to the right place on this episode of of the election shootout and George first [noise]\n\nHelen says her group signed up\nMore than Fifteen hundred people but there was a problem hundreds of them weren't showing up on the voter registration list she contacted secretary of state Brian Kemp office but Helen didn't get any answers so she went public and got a swift rebuke from camp can you walk me back to exactly when you receive that letter from the secretary of state's office\nI'm sure I read it and I got scared you know um and then passed\nCan split or claimed some of the applications for late or didn't come in at all and he turned the tables he suggested Helen May have broken the law by photo copying the applications and keeping copies\nIn Georgia that could lead to a felony charges so Helen turn to a prominent Atlanta attorney ... ... bond during the second\nThe fast number of ordinary people\nAre easily intimidated by\nExactly that sort of letter\nMr Bond or in eighty one he's a successful corporate lawyer and also something of a voting rights legit\nWay back in Nineteen sixty three he won his first case before the Supreme Court increasing the power of black voters in Atlanta after Helen asked for his help bon during wrote a letter to the secretary of state letting him know he'd be representing Helen and her organization\nAnd if you got any questions about their activities you direct them to me\nYou want to shoot at the OK Corral you came to the right place and be better to think about fat\nCamps office backed off and didn't file any charges but he's investigated other voting rights groups including one founded by his political opponents Stacey Abrams Kemp says he's just making it harder to cheat pondering calls these investigations part of a broader playbook used by Republicans to suppress the vote\nSo what happened to hell in Kim hope when I asked her she told me that two years later she went back to check on the people who are group tried to register half still weren't on the ropes and then we try to\nPhone banks have on the phone and many of them were no longer interested in\nWorking left that are going back to them because they in turn Bob so badly\nThe problem Helen Kimmo faced hasn't gone away earlier this month voting rights groups filed a lawsuit claims Brian camps office has violated the voting rights act and the constitution and issue is a law that freezes applications a name or other info doesn't exactly match other government records even if it's just missing a hyphen\nDo people can still vote but activists worry they might be discouraged by the confusion\nAnd they bond rent says there's another voter suppression strategy that still has him stumped it first dawned on him in twenty twelve\nYou're reading an article that the number of registered voters in Georgia had gone down\nThis raise serious questions because\nWe knew Georgia's population is growing you knew there had not been the black death to kill off\nA third of the state's\nAbout population and so\nWe had to be somewhere else for my own\nSo here's what's happening to bond earns missing voters states routinely perch hundreds of thousands of people from their voter registration rolls these are people who've died or moved away or gone to prison but Georgia and at least eight other states have what you could call it use it or lose it laws not voting can get you removed from the rolls\nLike this if you sit out a couple of elections you can get put on an inactive list the state send you a mailer if you don't respond and skip to more federal elections your perch and if you don't know your removed you may show up at your polling place only to find out you can't vote\nUnder camp there's been a massive jumped in purchase going on hair brown camps job is to protect our vote and this is an ad from power pack Georgia if donors promised ten million dollars to boost Stacey Abrams campaign we just can't trust that Brian camp [noise]\nCan spend on a bus tour around the state talking about his record\nI went to a stop south of Atlanta outside spray varies barbecue restaurant\nJust regular campaign stop for Georgia Republican\nKemp steps off the bus and gives his stump speech it's all about putting Georgia first and protecting its values then he gets back on the bus\nI get onto I asked him about the allegations that he's been aggressively purging voters he looks a little irritated\nWell I Would disagree with that statement what we're doing just within the law and required by law\nSo your office hasn't been more aggressive than others in the past in terms of removing voters from the rolls [noise]\nNo I don't believe we have them and we're just going through the process but you know having secure lessons you gotta have secure voter rolls\nKemp says he's made it easier to vote by setting up online registration but during his time in office there's been a big jump in the number of people who've been removed from the rolls more than one point six million have had their registration cancelled [noise]\nTime in my mind [noise]\nI decided to try and find people who've been purged without knowing it in Moultrie the small agricultural town in southern Georgia\nThere's some concerns over there in line\nWith Angela ... she's an investigative reporter from a PM reporting this we've got to sort of guide a database with the names and addresses of all five hundred thousand or so people purged in Georgia last year and our analysis shows that in the county where Moultrie is any more than two dozen others\nThe purchase are disproportionately affecting people of color\nAnd nine hundred and ten ran in that way\nMoultrie if the county seat we pass white column homes with manicured lawns and lush magnolias in front on the other side of town we drive over potholes streets along the rows of one story ramshackle houses [noise]\nWhen we get to the homes of people who are listed is perhaps some are boarded up and the residents have moved away at some of the other addresses we're told the people were looking for have gone off to college or the military as\nI Am this woman tells us she doesn't vote for religious reasons\nI like to\nWe're still looking for someone who wants to vote in November but doesn't know they've been purged so we go to seed Cornelius ponder a member of Moultrie city council and how you doing but he's also a businessman and pastor at the real church that stands for restoration and if ... and love\nHe says his family's lived in the area for generations\nMy great grandparents uh it was small\nSharecroppers Reverend ponder won his election last year by the slimmest of margins just nine votes he says while he was campaigning he encountered people who've been purged for failing to vote in previous elections\nI came across all quite a few people and the legend Iranian some of them went down to a vote and they could and then uh I had to be said that they got down there and they didn't have proper documentation anytime there's confusion like that during the election that's not good\nHe says with Trump in office enthusiasm is low in Moultrie in the last election voter turnout was below ten percent voters are also frustrated with all the obstacles purges confusion over polling locations and long lines\nThe racist there is no longer more devoted now and I think that's what we're we're we're in trouble with\nThen Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nTo Kathleen by their parents\nShe's Monti yeah\nSteve record say Kathleen ponder registered to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls Reverend ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he and\nKnow that she's been taken off the voting last\nAngela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside multiply\nHer I'm handle I completed and the reporter went public radio has our\nStory about people who've been removed from the voter last\nI don't know if you've heard of that day St\nAngelo explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years and very that Obama is saying do you remember\nYou know the book making her there and\nThen a last July you were taken off the voter last a cell that have been on July twenty eighth as twenty Seventeen and let you didn't get any notification that you\nWould do this you know\nDid you know they say that they take you laugh if you don't\nMiss ... says she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for Governor Rhodes obey the rules do back at Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nIt wasn't just that either he found training videos passwords plus a serious vulnerability in the architecture of the site itself\nThis would have allowed a hacker to modify and delete files on the server without detection was what you were doing here even technically hacking [laughter] um no I Would not counted as hacking now\nWhat was it then\nIt was it was browsing the Web site so at this point\nHe sits down and compose an email to the people I Kennesaw state\nHe says look I'm a local cyber security researcher I don't want to make a big deal out of this but you should probably know that I turned up all the scary stuff he doesn't hear back right away so he gets the cell phone number from rural king the guy in charge of chaos you get some on the phone but the more they talk Logan says\nThe weirdest things get he said that I should\nProbably stop a doing this or to work otherwise people downtown\nWould crush me what did he mean by that\nAt the time I took that to mean a politician's right and I also took that as more of a warning that a threat\nNo but in hindsight I'm not really sure\nLogan didn't get crushed by politicians or anyone else though the FBI did pay him a visit a few months later now he's sitting at the center of a messy situation one that says a lot about the state of election security in Georgia and across the country\nLogan first planes the problem Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp is in Washington DC\nI Want to thank the committee and chairman hurt for invited me to discuss election security\nHe's testifying before a house subcommittee on information technology and and over the past few weeks he's been boasting about the security of Georgia system he's also been calling out the federal government for overstepping its election responsibilities and trying to quote subvert the constitution under the guise of security\nBy the way it kept doesn't know about Logan findings yet and that this hearing he's going off again sure he says back on the DNC was troubling but\nThe D.C response to these attacks has been to take steps towards federalizing aspects of the ... election systems in standardizing security measures there is a better way to\nHearing goes on for hours eventually Kemp starts getting pushback from Jerry Connelly a democratic senator from Virginia Mr Kemp um I Want to make sure I understood your testimony\nCommonly skeptical you basically says so you're telling us that there's never an election situation that calls for any kind of federal intervention ever in camp is like no not really Connelly doesn't buy it\nWhat about the voting rights act he says states were actively disenfranchising people than the government stepped in isn't that positive Kemp doesn't seem to understand the question\nI Would say that the voting rights act is still intact\nYes but it's an example of the opposite of what you were asserting it was an example of federalizing something to protect the franchise I don't believe it because of the states weren't doing it in fact states were actively suppressing boats you don't deny that do well\nI'm not sure I understand what that has to do with the election system\nWhile I'm dealing with your assertion of the principles that we shouldn't federalize any aspect of this and I'm arguing that the voting rights act is it clear exception to your principal\nAnd that perhaps the federal government in federal elections at least has an interest that overrides state interests when it comes to protecting at the cyber level the integrity of the results\nWill certainly your opinion on differs\n\n[noise] back much Germany\nAt the end of the hearing campus given one last chance to speak and he stands from states have this cyber security staff handled he says and in fact maybe federal officials should pay us visit maybe they would learn a few things\nI think there will be very pleasantly surprised [laughter]\nThe team in Kennesaw state was certainly surprised in fact slogans email sent them scrambling [laughter]\nThey didn't want to be interviewed for this story but all the emails for public record which means you can get them if you ask nicely [laughter]\nLet's start on August twenty eight twenty sixteen Logan emails chaos you you tell somebody found any says quote there's a strong probability your site is already compromise\nMembers of Cass youth center for election system starts circulating the email around\nAnd over the next few days they start to realize\nYeah this is that the school's information security team recommends doing some scams but then the director of the elections team weights and he says wait a minute wait a minute this is our busiest time of year the last thing we want is for the site to become unavailable all these counties Nita\nReading this at first it's easy to think okay that makes sense\nBut this idea that you can't make elections secure because you're so busy preparing for the elections\nThe scenes problematic [laughter]\nBy September fifteenth these scans still haven't been done\nSome of the elections team says they're struggling with the technology quote we discovered we're a little out of our debt\nFinally the elections team gets the breach fix or so they think it's October twenty seven two months after Logan first emailed them they think the security team and said quote this has been a huge help to us reading this email you can basically here this deep sigh of relief like\nThis is over except it's not [noise]\nYou might be wondering what brand camp has to say about all this well despite Logan land downloading dreams sensitive information\nWhich camp called deeply concerning Kemp also said that Georgia is protected with layers upon layers of security and specifically he's made two arguments number one the voting machines are never connected to the Internet which makes them safer from hacking\nAnd number two breaking into just one wouldn't really do much you need a wide scale conspiracy to actually mess with an election [noise]\nSo there's a good reason to push back on both of those arguments will lose arguments are wrong rich Milo is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech\nHe used to be the chief technology officer at Hewlett Packard\nYou don't need to mount an attack on thousands and thousands of polling places you just need to have a really good idea a word at target your tax in order to flip the right number of votes in order to get above with racial\nPlus he says because Georgia system is so centralized there are multiple points of entry for an attacker that's part of what Logan discovery proved not only did Georgia leave itself exposed the people running things didn't even seem to understand how bad the problem was or what was at stake\nThere making it up they're scared to death they're making it up on a day to day basis they have no idea what's going on in these systems they have no idea why they work or don't work and they're kind of living in Boston fear that this whole thing is going to come crashing down around two years\nThey also failed to realize something else something really important\n[noise] five months after Logan made his initial discovery he was hanging out with a friend another cyber security guy I was like Christ I ever tell you about that wacky stuff I found a K issue and he said no tell me more they sit down at a computer and download everything again\nExcept this time there's more because it looks like new info has been added since January so were you able to get the exact same amount of stuff the second time or effectively yeah so nothing had changed\nWell they edit hinted to fix it but in such a way that I I actually don't understand what they were trying to do\n[laughter] okay\n[laughter] those those by my reaction [noise]\nYeah I don't really understand [noise]\nKen didn't want to talk for this story but I was able to chat with Kathy Cox Georgia secretary of state from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand seven a Democrat she oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early two thousand and unlike every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake um they're just so many opportunities limited truly only by one's imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that Bernhardt is a\nPHD student at the University of Michigan\nHe studies the Ariz ... vulnerability\nThat says the problem of Georgia system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the group's your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it's set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree [noise]\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional\nRights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise] they asked\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Austin", "day": "21"}
