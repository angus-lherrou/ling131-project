R. ... this is revealed a male let's\nWe're telling a story about two men [noise]\nPrince Albert does in jail and Leon tennis zero is the district attorney who put them to\nBe a can is Errol use Louisiana's three strikes law that would be to offender statue to lock up Prince Albert for a really long sentence and reporter ... has been hearing a lot that it's not just Prince Albert thousands of people\nBelieve what does the d._a. has to say about that well\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me\nI asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person\nUsed to work for Kennedy era as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you in da a well\nIn regular here's a seven years but India's a job like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard was even lower her office relied or a better way of describing either it was just the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that that too often or statute it was the policy that the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like do you can has their own never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's as mines that are the more people will be locked up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop Iran from punished fun as fun as far as ... you know our services are the times\nIn fact he helped create and goal as law library and after Harry comic was elected da ... noticed something guys were being prosecuted really aggressively under the habitual offender statute and given sentences like a hundred two hundred years for small crimes\nPeople will come in to prove them with like senators and like when we did was like to do that\nWell for\nFeeling a little bit and then he was like that\nBut you did an analysis and found the vast majority of guys prosecuted under this law were black\nHe also found there were white men comic could have gone after but didn't in other words comic used his discretion to punish black men more harshly so in Nineteen Seventy five biggie and another jailhouse lawyer filed a civil rights suit alleging racial discrimination they sued comic\nHe loves to gun [laughter] yeah I forgot I did it or what but anyway Johnny Was sleeping in a motive real so much and greed\nWill war cool hers\nTo plead guilty with the threat of main mode to build\nAs soon as the life and so a lot of people who were pretty good the even the wind June\nSo be saying this law courses innocent people to plead guilty\nAnd out everybody said that still true in New Orleans all the lawyers I talk\nIf for this story which will get back to anyway biggies lawsuit against kind of getting go anywhere but he was a good jailhouse lawyer and after Twenty one years in prison he got himself out on lifetime parole\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo kind of began using this law to lock people up most of them black men than what happened\nState after state started passing their own harsher three strikes allies and the prosecutors who came after comic kept going on that note guess who Harry kinda hired right out of law school to begin assistant da\nLimit is Leon Kenneth zero bingo ...\nWas about prosecuting cases he certainly wanted us to be successful\nWhen Kennedy was an assistant ... almost five years then he ran for judge and one and for almost two decades every case he presided over came from ... office these are the legal waters Ken is era learn to swim and\nOut I told you can is arrows used a lot more than two thousand six hundred times to send people to prison well Ninety percent of these people had been black Ninety percent New Orleans is only around sixty percent black\nSo what you're telling me as a nothing's really change from the time he was in prison\nIt's even worse now because so many more people have been locked up and from the inside Prince Albert sees what that looks like\nWe're always doing most of them on a road runner to bring to the same for George [noise]\nEnded other people mentioned the habitual offender statue\nYes when we all have similar ... for those of everything and all these other people were they also from Orleans Parish yeah\n\nKenneth Hardin was one of princes attorneys he's a public defender also a sharp a dresser blue suit and tie crisp white shirt\nMr Albert because of his prior convictions his past felonies and they were on drug charges he faced a circumstance where the either decided to go to trial or face life face like if you lose mandatory life basically the epitome of the three strikes you're out\nFor six to twelve [noise] and they're still come to my children were was old for\nThat we're going to ignore one of those ... convictions and charged him as a double film you but they also include a number the number of the shows was ten\nTen years in other words charge prince not for the three strikes just for two double bill him\nFor was to use the bubble boo loved it for him\nWas this the first time you've heard of that ...\n[noise] those those are the ... river\nPrince was hoping for drug court some sort of program to help them tickets habit and stay with us five kids\n... [laughter] true true true\nYou feel like you were being black child won't won't like drug been cores to begin with [noise]\nPrince had to make this decision outside a cramped courtroom people call the addict\nSmall courtroom and you know this is a very narrow hallway so a lot of our conversations we had to have around the corner where there's a little bit more standing [noise] and I remember there were two two women with him and his dad Conrad was there\nThere are ... and ... ... or ... you're from\n... fair and he was very emotional\nAnd I remember going back and forth because I wanted to give him the time that you needed to discuss this with his family and they want to be intrusive\nPrincess ... Linda was there to\nHear you so a lot of the he was\nOnly asked me if I put them in a tub or life day to help those that have occurred\nTo me there were a lot of tears at one point a recall and being in prayer about like literally huddling together really just deciding what to do this was literally all morning and there was one point where I'll go back to his job and it seemed like he wanted to take the risk and go to trial\nAnd then there was some points where it's like you know what I'm going to take this deal to travel more time to see if you can you know they were lower and wish I did and they didn't\nReally wool or above lead and learn to love forever or ever loved trove of covering about ... above\n... to ... ... ...\nI remember him saying that very fate very\nVery low voice\nI'm I'm gonna take to do\n\nOne of the things that you have to do when you enter a plea of guilty and Mr our we had to do Critz had to do was on the form to\nSay if I have not been forced Britain or her into his plea of guilty\nAnd he has to initially that\nInto their jaws when she asked him back to him yes ma'am what\nEver you a face between life or ten years how is that not ... how would that not forced how is that not threatened\nBut yet we have people every single day stand before a judge\nAnd they are entering this\nBecause they feel they have to avoid a worse consequence\n\n\nTwo thousand and twelve the your prince was prosecuted with Ken is there is high point for using the habitual offender statue he prosecuted five hundred people under the law that year it has gone down since then officially but even these numbers of people prosecuted under the law\nThey don't tell the full story ... ... what do you mean well the da's office also uses this law in a different way to get people to plead guilty in cases where the law never appears on the record\nFor example don't tell someone charged with a misdemeanor crimes petty offense plead guilty or will bump up your charge to a felony which is a much more serious crime New Orleans public defender Lauren Anderson sees this every day\nWith a client has for example a simple battery charge which is an estimator but there was some kind of object he's ... we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here and like all across the street and aggravated battery and so they'd be looking at twenty to life on it for ... like\nYou're saying that they would change the charge so that they could then inside the multiple bell correct exactly and there was no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nWe know cannon Sarah Hughes the law in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [laughter]\n[laughter]\nMm of course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a ...\nAgreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believes himself not guilty he could've exercise has constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy said my hope is that Mr Albert well apply himself toward programs by which to better himself", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "07"}
