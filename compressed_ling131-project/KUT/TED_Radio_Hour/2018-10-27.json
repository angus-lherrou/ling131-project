I'm not coming out to listen to\nThis episode painfully funny first this news\n\nBut yeah you become the data to such a low again we took the British feelings for very long period of time nobody really wants to talk about today was horrified that I had been say upfront about it\nSo in a way I sort of wasn't us any questions atoll because they in the polls that somebody was not checked out had children and all the children seem to have you know just one had each and happy or Mr animal\n[noise]\nI have to say I have to tell you that my kids had my mother started having two moms and my daughter was in a sea she go ... moms rushed to be with her and we were both looking after her and making soup and tightening up and one of her friends came in and went\nTo my mom's not fair [laughter] that way but [laughter]\nUm did it have a negative effect on your career at all for any period of time\nShow show I lost what special and was told to I couldn't possibly has certain shows and to that it was a wouldn't be appropriate\nI Wonder whether I mean you describe what happened after you came out and um this long period of fear and and obviously it must have been quite painful to endure that um how were you able to withstand it I mean what do\nYou have if you get death threat to trust me it's not fun but you have to stand for the things that you believe in you have to stay strong inside and I I don't know how else you do it I I Love that there's a T shirt in the ... when I was lost in America that said I stand on the right side of history and you have to believe that [noise] I genuinely believe that equality\nFor everybody is better for the whole society [noise] Mm\nSo after coming out and then dealing with everything that came with that Sandy's activation button was pressured again in twenty Fifteen\nTo sign for women's rights\nWe decided to found a brand new political party because if the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal is that the ballot box that nobody no idea what they're doing but didn't know how complicated it wants to start to political party I sold it can't be that difficult men have been doing if\nSomebody [noise]\nDefinitely stop it by calling it the women's equality puff a at a gay and straight away people's heads you may\nCall it that\nDon't know I just thought we'd be ... I [noise]\n\nI've been doing to secrets you know I just [noise]\nTo call it that much of this was\nI'm telling you how many times I've heard somebody say I'm not a feminist buff always think of as a button\nSometimes they count all the roses in like ... and then I started getting off the hilarious legend games have been you'll bras [noise] yes because it was a famously made a flammable material\n[noise]\nThat's why women stock when they will [noise]\n\n\nHow were you able to react that way like how are you able to to joke about things that other people might just pulled her hair out and get really angry at the party looks blood with anger\nBut when I was ... I think yeah I think that the way to get people to pay attention is to not to them and ... like some you know raging person who wants to run around with\nThat because actually I'm not like that I perfectly normal sensible human being who wants to try and make the best players and I'm very interested in like keep an eye here in the u._k. if the big increase in ratings that seems to be a late night shows it's all using humor as a\nWeapon in the current political situation uh I I think that is the way forward and nothing is more disarming to protect the new finding them sunny ... how do you call the policy whose aim is to get the call Jay for winning the women's equality wind isn't should pretend unfolded either the pain can beg budget is wrong with you [laughter]\nIf that is yeah and also a life is full of things that we believe to be ... which are not true no woman ever been to ... in the sixties was made up by a journalist\nI even looked it up on the Internet and I could not find anything about\nWhat happened was a whole two of my ... young as anything but a that was a time when a Vietnam or people who didn't want to go to saving the Vietnam War but the ... and that that idea was conflated with the protests that were held at the Miss America contest at the\nDeed crown a sheet Miss America which is funny but nobody seems to remember that that I Would have liked to say\nTo me this is like that's the thing like I suspect that you don't sit around and consciously think I Am going to use humor to advance by ideas but it just sort of your temperament is\nThat right that is absolutely and and I have to keep the money that's a bad things happen in the wild things every day I think really this is happening now it's just so hot breaking and so I'm holding the the only thing I think you can do is you have to start combining it ah that activism but also\nWas remembering that by human beings and we have a sense of humor I don't see any other way forward frankly because if you just something about those things you would just so they\nKnow we're in the world for example the women have equal representation in positions of power they looked like a very quick look at the top one hundred companies in the London stock exchange in twenty sixty one hundred companies uh how many women running\nSeven I suppose I'm realize that seven main I'll run by men will cool Joan\n\nJoan running hundred company [noise]\nJane run by men who have [noise]\nI'm sure David ... job okay [noise] why\nDoes it matter and well it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap or guy\nNo we're in the wilds do women on the same as men and that is never going to change unless we have more women at the ... in the ... with the law or the equal pay act in Britain was posted in Nineteen Seventy five\nNevertheless there are still many many women who from November until the end of the year by comparison to them male colleagues are effectively working for free\nI in fact well Economic Forum estimates that women will get equal pay\n\nI mean all the examples that you give in your talk like more companies are run by Dave's or John are women who run companies I mean it ... it would be funnier if it wasn't so depressing sign up\nI Know I'm ... I'm just trying to pointed out ah you know life is uh is is has its many amusing sides to it ah I have to say Mr Trump bless him has been a boon frankly a boon to factor is slow so [laughter] it could be depressed or you could just also find the funny side\nAnd uh so it makes me smile and I have to say when I say something and I can see the long enough enriched by that just makes me laugh mall and it just it ... the Greek drama mosques were tragedy in comedy and they stood side by side and the Greeks knew that we should know that that in the midst of this bad that\nWe are still ... and and the sense of humor and a good love is one of the things that makes us human loved it brings you together I think that's one of those in the last night and I had some other people laughing together\nWe don't even know each other but with the book together by that was\nWe've just got to keep going for\nMedian Sandy toxic she hosts a show Q.

drank years now and I had come on my back I was done in the dead sea and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking it's where\n\nDo you think ultimately that comedy can change people's minds I think Gary has we've seen\nFor generations comedy taking the risks that no one else would weather was will and grace\nMainstreaming the algae repeat community on prime time television or you know black fish right now I think comedy is the easiest most reliable way to tell people things they don't want to hear\n[noise] you know earlier you were you were saying that you didn't set out to be an activist or or an advocate but I mean you sometimes ended up changing people's\nMinds right right so like I've never been like okay if I'm going to talk about Palestine Israel and how people deserve equality regardless of faith\nHave to use comedy because otherwise people are going to get defensive if more like oh I'm going to tell a joke about when I was strip searched and I'm not really thinking about like\nThis is the best way to deliver this message I'm thinking about\nThis is a really funny story I'm totally and get them to laugh and then it's usually not till after the show where I'm like oh my God someone just came up to me and said they didn't know that Palestinians where people they thought it was the name of a terror group and it's like it's always afterwards that I realized I shaking someone's ground\nIt's never my intention to go out and do that my only intention is make\nThem laugh get on General Hospital women\nLet's may soon as I can hear her full talk to dot com\nOkay so may soon was just saying that she's not a comedian and activists being you basically use comedy is like your form of activism yeah\nComedy is like the best tool for that it just opens people up and what makes comedy so effective is that if you're making them laugh along the way they're going to listen to the deeper cuts stuff\nThis is Nick ... also a standup comic they use the daughter of Iranian immigrant and as a kid her parents were regalia her with stories about life during the Iran Iraq War specifically the unusual way they got\nThrough bombing range\nAnd they talked about how they would go into the\nBasement and how they would turn on the canals and how they would block out the windows and they would be like oh we would play\nCards with raising we tell stories and then we hear a bomb and then we worry that it was our neighbor you know and\nThen again [laughter]\nSo I think the human capacity you\nKnow the way humans get through these really terrible times is by flipping the script on themselves ... kind of lets you take the story back into your own hands\n... own turn flipping the script happened when she was in college right after September eleventh and the start of a wave of Islamophobia\nAnd it started becoming clearer and clearer that Islamophobia is one of those things it's not going away\nI kept thinking like oh will be will hate Muslims for like a few months and then we'll stop [laughter] like I just thought that was going to be some reasonable projector\nUm and then that guy never never stopped you know and um and I felt like I could you know I had a voice in that my voice doesn't Iranian American Muslim was\nNot something that the average American has already heard\nAgain decided that the best way to disarm the haters was to make them laugh and that's\nBeen the goal is just um you know if you have never had a Muslim friend\nUm maybe my stupid faith can be you're my friend\nThe game does this through what she calls social justice comedy and how it works well here's the gains explanation from the stage\nOf the population can be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and Florida\nCategory here are the haters comedian if\nMichael's a convert these haters because they hate a lot of things which leads to negative outcomes like a racism violence and Ted new Jet Blue is we have to reckon with the haters but there's various within this group and it's not they should go after all of that right so what\nI've created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters I basically took all of haters I put them in a petri dish like a scientist and this is what I found\nThat we have the trolls they're the people who have quit their jobs so that they can post on Youtube videos all day long\nOn their haters now these people will be at a stoplight they'll wait to turn green and white male that tree\nMost interested in is the swing hate are they just don't have enough information and then by like the target was social justice comedy because\nIt makes you laugh right I don't think you enter into a state of openness and a moment of open that's a good social justice comedians can still get a whole bunch of information and if they're really skilled uh rectal exam\nFor social justice for us it's not partisan okay this is a political comedy is about justice and no one is against justice I don't want to make me feel like you're sitting in front of a burrito\nLike either be hearing a real like an interesting treaties on income inequality that that are really sophisticated poo joke right\nOkay so she wanted to do something about Islamophobia and wants to look for swing haters\nSo me and another comedian ... decided to round up like a bunch of Muslim American comedians I'm mad as per usual\nAnd take him around the country to places like Alabama and Tennessee Mississippi and arrows on\nThe you know what I mean just like places where you are accustomed to seeing like a bunch of friendly Muslims and so we would duty street actions we would set up like an ... in the middle of town square any\nQuestions about Islam\nNot the joy just about on the road to join\nReplied them with pastries so that they can feel like hey somebody's going to give me pastries doesn't have it out for me what would people get tough oh my gosh they could ask literally anything\nWhy do some Muslim women look like you are right\nYou can't tell who they are\nA bank and you can\nReally go to class you know we got a question like that all over the country um you know because I don't wear that job and I don't you know cover so you know so like people could ask those questions I don't\nI'm another question that was frequent was\nWhy don't Muslim denounce\nTerrorism tell me why I haven't seen\nWe got that everywhere and I continue to get that and my travels all over the country why don't Muslims denounced terrorism um so there's a huge PR missed after\nThat happened and where American thing that must have felt like the ... and I don't know how that happened they got literally every Muslim I Know done\nI'm like did we not ... like out of the habit at\nWhen we come back in the ...
