[noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up\nI Love this idea of law and the thing that translates dreams about just as we all believe in America is when you were just in plain old you but you're not supposed to notice it don't give up on democracy or did they are in a democracy in which was something that everybody can understand using shake\n\nRobyn Steinberg [noise] she wants to change the way to bail works in the U.S today because she says it creates a two tiered system one for the rich and one for everyone else\nLet's talk for a moment about what it means to be in jail even first you day where it can mean losing your job\nJeopardizing their immigration status is amazing losing after they've your children what's more if you're in jail on bail your four times more likely to get a jail sentence than if you had been free and that jail sentence will be three times longer and if you are black\nOr Latino and cash they'll have been fat you are ... times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell and if you were white now imagine just one moment that it's used ... and you don't have the five hundred dollars to get out and someone\nComes along and offers you a way out\nIn the guilty they say you're going to go home back to your job just flea jumping the nights like you just like anybody would do in that situation you plead guilty whether you did it or not but now you have a\nCriminal record that went to follow you for the rest of your life\nSo we've interviewed really some really innovative thinkers about how to reform the criminal justice system and you came upon a a really simple way to kind of hacking to kind of look at this and say wait a minute there could be simpler way to start to tackle this can you tell me how you came to that idea\nShort so uh my husband and I are actually sitting having dinner one night many many years ago I he's also up with a public defender\nAnd we were venting about watching one more client plead guilty so she could go home and my husband said you know we should just start paying bail for our clients we should start to bail fund and just start paying their mail and in that moment the idea was boring we weren't sure whether we could do it we weren't sure what\nThe results would be but we knew that we had something there that if you could attack this problem at the end we might be able to actually begin to unpack some of the injustice sue you we just got to work you started to raise money we did so\nWe we pitched the idea for very long time and um had a very hard time getting anybody to 'em and give us any donations for the ... and then I met Jason ... and his father Joe ... and they had a Family Foundation and they were courageous enough to be our very first donors and they gave us a donation\nA hundred thousand dollars to start the Bronx freedom on and we began to pay people fail with that fun and what we learned is the revolving nature of the bail fun is that a dollar that you use any gear it can be used two or three times because of the end of a criminal case the bail comes back into the fund\nA I Would be bold enough to say that some of those dollars that the farm family gave us way back when it's probably still operating in the Bronx today so when when when\nSomebody post bail and they go to trial and their case is dismissed that bill money's returned\nSo then when he gets returned regardless of the case how come I'm at the point of Vail is to ensure that people come back to court so somebody comes back to court for each and every court appearance at the end of the case whether it was a guilty plea whether it was a conviction or whether it was a complete liquid alert dismissal\nThe bail money comes back so it can revolve over and over again if you create if\nSo how does it work I mean you you have teams of people who would go to jail and say don't plead guilty we can help post bail for you and is that how it works\nSo the most important work gets done by our local people on the ground we called bailed is raptors many of whom live in Portland cross razor impacted by the criminal legal system themselves they work on the ground to interview people in jails\nAnd what we've learned from the Bronx freedom find is that all you need to ensure that people come back to court is effective ways to notify them about the next court dates and to provide support systems while they're out of jail and asking them to services that might exist and community so when problems come up to prevent coming back to court\nWe can help them solve that we're all\n\nTen years may have been paying down low income residents of New York city and what we have learnt habits alone at our ideas of white people come back to court\nAnd how the criminal legal system itself is operate it turns out\nMoney isn't what makes people come back to court\nWe know that because when the ... and pay the bail Ninety six percent of fires for try for every quarter parents it's how awful evidence\nThat we don't need cash or ankle bracelets or unnecessary systems of surveillance has supervision we simply need court reminders and that way to come back to court\nNext we learned and if they're held in jail on a misdemeanor Ninety percent of people will plead guilty but when the sun pays veil over half the cases are dismissed\nAnd in the entire history of the ... that had two percent of our clients have ever received a gel that is kind of a [noise]\nUm\nIt sounds like over the course of your career and you sort of come to the ocean that system these massive reform\nBut that may be a decades long struggle and in the meantime one way to attack it is by attacking bail is by dealing with the bail issue yeah the way I like to think about it as being while we're thinking through ways after systemic reform to happen while litigators litigating\nCases wild policy reformers are doing their work people sitting in jail self today they need a lifeline we can't ask them to sit in those cold concrete jail cells while we talk about systemic reform it takes too long so when we think about revolving bell friends when we think about the ... project or the Bronx freedom fund or the community bail funds that does is turn this country\nThat is an immediate lifeline to those folks sitting in jail cells as we hope to continue to Nate and moved systemic reform forward\nTo when we think about like ... you know examples of criminal justice or injustice in America you know like vigilante justice or the way people behave in the wild west and we thank\nGod you know one uncivilized time like we think we're we're just so much more involved than in civilized and the way that we deal with this now but but we're not\n[noise] so we're kidding ourselves um and I know that that is very hard for all of us to grapple with because all of us are implicated in what has become our criminal legal system\nUm you know we seem to have in this country and insatiable appetite for incarceration\nAh we seemed to have in this country I'm very harsh mentality around punishment to we have views are criminal legal system to solve social problems that we used to look at as all of our responsibilities\nAnd instead we have pushed it away from our consciousness as if it didn't implicate all of us but of course have done\nThat Robin Steinberg in November of two thousand Seventeen and

hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights\nLawyer Stephen was that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes Steven was\nAnd it's not gonna take a hundred two hundred years and we have come close twice or one of them just as Barbara Jaffe in two thousand Fifteen became the first judge in legal history to actually issue or read the papers corpus on behalf of the nonhuman animal on behalf of Hercules and Leo so we actually had a hearing\nVery similar to the hearing that James Somerset had an\nSo Jaffe actually was quite similar to a more Mansfield she in a long decision made it clear that she was quite sympathetic to our arguments but ultimately self that she was bound by the decision of a higher court in another part of of the state of New York but I Believe is she had not\nFelt that way she would likely have rules in our favor\nYou are trying to change the law in a big way this is a big uphill battle like you may not see the end of this battle\nWell just like a human rights lawyer is not going to see the end of the human rights battle the battle for human rights will continue as long as there are humans who want to explain to each other but what I'm already living to see is the beginning of the battle there really\nIsn't a battle when one side to sing and the other side to person there there isn't a battle the battle begins when both sides are persons and their rights begin to conflict that's the battle then I'm already beginning to see\nAnd that's the one that I was hoping to live to see and to bring about and it's happening [noise]\nThat Steven ... he's the founder of the non human rights project you can watch his entire talk at ... dot com on the show today ideas about hacking the law and how we can change\nGovernment to be more fair to the people it represents [noise] do you think that there are better alternatives to democracy or do you think that in general democracy is the best way to govern ourselves [noise] I'm a big fan of democracy [laughter] this is bad headache and even though he's totally pro democracy\nHe's actually got a big problem with elections my ideal\nOf democracy is that every person should have an equal say in the direction of that country in the laws of that country\nOf course this is seriously accomplished by giving one person one vote but as most people now in practice it's not practical they call it the most votes a wasted many people don't vote lots of people such as migrants refugees count votes\nUm so my ideal democracy is one where the considered will of the people is taken into account and I think elections don't achieve those ideals\nSo in your view our elections just fundamentally anti democratic [noise]\nIs fundamentally flawed in the way the practice now\nThey have a elites and they have a a money interests ... famous thinkers for centuries equated elections with aristocracy and all the ... or so I'm I'm happily putting myself within these group of people and saying you know I think elections actually fundamentally flawed\nAnd whether we can overcome the crisis I think there's basically two responses that we can take the money has to go down the populist cause the fascist roots and the other was to trust fund mechanisms and modes to do democracy veteran differently\nThan the exact mechanism for fixing democracy that Brett has in mind well it's pretty radical here's bread headache on the head stage\nSo I'm going to ask you two questions I Want you to put your hands up if you agree the first question is who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing [noise] the second question is who thinks as democracies a functioning wow Valentine must be one politician in the audience some way\nNot but my point is there was a massive paradox contradiction here I think there's two ways to resolve this paradox\nOne is to give up on democracy the other option I think is to fix this broken system which brings me to my ... my ... month\nIt's technical name it's still too soon but it's common name is random selection and the id is actually very simple randomly select people and put 'em in parliament [laughter]\nWait\nYou know you want to just put random people into a into a legislative body and say here you go up figure figure it out is that is that more or less what you're saying [laughter]\nUm this seemingly are absurd idea is actually based on hundreds of experiments worldwide where this actually\nHappens happens while the Ireland is the most recent country to have randomly selected nonchalant people to talk about the constitutional ban on abortion to talk about how they can tackle climate change to talk about other things I fix him parliaments\nThe Ninety nine randomly selected sample of people went through\nWe cans of deliberation informed by experts with public input into that process and they came up with the proposal supported by around two thirds of them to abolish this constitutional ban on abortion which was input to referendum on about two thirds the Irish people agreed with them\nIf these people are so good at it why do we still need politicians\nHave to be honest that idea scares me I don't want the first hundred people on the phone book running the country I Want people who are steeped in policy who understand the nuances of how laws get made Abu understand the consequences like that's what I Want so random democracy you know solve this problem\nElections don't produce experts this is a complete jealousy otherwise we would elect a brain surgeons um yeah elections produce people who are good at winning elections\nAnd to be good at winning election you need a massive war chest of money you need to be charismatic you need to be out to inspire people with digital sweets I don't I'm not sure\nBut it doesn't mean that you're good at making policy I making so I Would actually argue that's a random reps any simple with good process informed by experts who've costs or don't have power they just have the power to get it from ...\nUm [noise] would result in better policy of course you would potentially need these people to go through an induction process what they learn about how the system guys will how low making is made except for\nThe other option that we hand over the running of our country to a group of experts is exactly what else are turned regimes argue China\nIn theory is run by groups of ... yeah yeah I think it's it's a you open yourself up to the accusations ... and if you say I think we should actually handed over to a techno ...\nWell that's the thing like let me see if I understand correctly\nIn a system that you think would would be a better system more representative essentially you would eliminate the lectures yes right you get rid of people voting for elected officials you get rid of that and you have some kind of system a lottery ... a lottery whatever it is where people are randomly selected from the population\nAnd they get a letter in the mail and they say hey you know you're going to be a representative for the next two years and\nThat's that's how you would you do do a there's a lot of protests questions around that but the key thing is that it works when people do this people make trusted balanced decisions and I I I think it would lead to a massive increase interest in the in the governmental system and the decisions that are my\n... and we come back and just a moment red headache describes how he envisions randomly selecting leaders on the show today hacking the law I'm Guy rise and\nYou're listening to
