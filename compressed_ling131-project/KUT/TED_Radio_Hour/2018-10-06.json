impossible\nTrue nature of reality that is\nFrom NPR [noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up [noise]\nUltimately we're interested in understanding how life works\nAre your eye where you're where we are\nWhat we need to do is figure out how the brain do so that was a biological machinery Merrill have technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their email\nThis episode what makes us us\nFirst this news\n... and and presumably we can pinpoint things that aren't diseases at all\nSure to the shape of our noses that was a recent paper that was published twenty three and be just released a study a defining the associations between gene variants and\nWhether or not you're a morning person while we're talking about the kinds of things that ... out about it the water cooler or on your way to get a coffee\nAnd we're beginning to understand the DNA sequences that can explain those behaviors it's it's pretty mind boggling\nWho we are what makes us us it's why the oldest questions out there like new technology means we've never been closer to answering it in all kinds of ways that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago\nSo today on a show ideas from science ecology and philosophy about why we are who we are [laughter]\n\nSo Sam Steinberg worked in the lab that developed one of the most groundbreaking innovations in gene editing you may have heard of it it's called CRISPR and Sam describe why it's such a big deal\nOn the head for ... for over half a century that DNA can taint the blueprints to make all living things [noise] but you know to tell us a lot about ourselves about our ancestry in our traits and our disease susceptibility\nBut there are things in the genome that you might not want to find out for example with two misspelled versions of a gene called April before your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is more than ten times above average\nAnd was a single disease copy of the Huntington gene virtually guaranteed Huntington's disease a devastating form of nerve the generation\nAnd then both of these cases there are currently any effective prevention or treatment options and sort of seen as many wondering is this information even worth knowing\nWell what if we could do more than just learned that information by reading the genome but actually rewrite the genome secure genetic diseases at their source what if editing the letters of you know you were a simple and easy is fixing typos in Microsoft Word\nThis is no longer a science fiction thanks to a new tool called CRISPR Cass nine in the last three years scientists have delivered CRISPR cast lines of human cells and precisely fixed the genetic mutations that costs cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease\nGenome editing and animals themselves is teaching us more about how cancers progress and revealing promising new drug targets and companies have already raised almost a billion dollars to apply Christopher ... as a fair\nImpatience\nThe CRISPR cast my technology was co invented in my PHD lab at the University of California Berkeley and many considered to be one of the biggest breakthroughs the last couple of decades but five years ago when I started my PHD with Jennifer down or CRISPR wasn't the technology at all [noise]\n\nSo you're saying the technology didn't even exist five years ago I mean how\nHas become a huge deal\nSo when I started my PHD and Jennifer's lab that was too many ten you wouldn't find a single\nMention of Christopher in you know delay media unless was talking about a vegetable CRISPR ... a but in the scientific literature we're really talking a few dozen articles so it was about maybe one month was coming out\nWe now or at a point to day where every day we have around five or ten articles being published I think you will will not find a biologist in the world\nThat doesn't know about Chris ... and you probably won't find many left that aren't actively using CRISPR to how to study whatever biological question they go after and their laboratories because ultimately we're interested in understanding how life works and\nIf we know that DNA in codes life than what better than a tool to rewrite the DNA and study what effects are\nOkay the technical details of how Chris protests nine works are complicated CRISPR for instance is an acronym for clustered regularly enter spaced short\n... repeat and cast mine is the key protein that makes it all work but what you need to know is that CRISPR cast nine makes it easy relatively inexpensive to edit genes in precise waste any gene can any living thing from bacteria to people\nComing back to the four letters of DNA thinking about those eight hundred dictionaries filled\nWith the same for letters and they'll imagine that you have to\nSearch for a single page and not just single page for the single letter on that page and mark that site for a change and maybe not any change but an aide to a tea not an agency or an aide to see [noise] so for decades this was the kind of science disguise science fiction idea that we could dream about doing\nBut no one was going to be able to do it because it just seemed like it would never be possible\nSo that now with with CRISPR basically you can just go into the body find that chain of letters causing a disease or something and then just cut out one or two letters and replace it with with the right letter absolutely\nThat's exactly what it does and I'll just have one ... it's not been demonstrated yet in human patients so\nIf you just said the same thing for human cells in a petri dish absolutely with human patients come to the additional challenge of getting to the right cells and that's the same challenge at every drug has to contend with this this issue of delivery and now it's just a matter of figuring out how to do that inside patients\nMailed the next frontier will be really using this tool to improve human health\nCan be achieved the ultimate goal of sharing a genetic disease at a source at the level of DNA instead of just treating the downstream symptoms\nImagine the future you stem cell technology together as Chris protests nine to remove disease cells from patients repair them in the lab and the transplant those correct that cells back into the body\nClinical trials are already underway that offer a cure for HIV aids by editing the DNA in blood cells taken from HIV positive patience\nAnd I suspect we're going to see more and more clinical trials with CRISPR entering the pipeline to the next few years what really got folks speaking this past year was a report in may but for the first time ever scientists use CRISPR casts line to edit the DNA in human embryos\nAnd unlike therapy and adult patients this would introduce heritable changes that can be passed on to subsequent generations you can imagine the controversy that this has provoked\nAnd many fear that this technology can be abused that it would usher in an era of eugenics were designer babies were select few could pick and choose the best use for their offspring\nOthers would say a free deny unborn children a technology that could ease human suffering or eradicated disease it would be immoral\nChristopher cast line is forcing us to rethink what kind of world we want to live in\nAnd they're already ethical issues to discuss about how we should use this technology and how it should be regulated [noise]\nThat ... when we come back in just a minute a little more about how gene editing could change who\nWe are and how we should feel

I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR it could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with\nOkay just to clarify our environment is helping mould our genes\nOh obviously I bet if I was brought up as an Apache or as a a a Japanese samurai or as a a Romanian\nPeasant and the fourteenth century there'll be differences undoubtedly compared to who I Am now\nSo we just have to to Sam Sam brag about you know like how being um\nA person is is possibly in that did have genetic codes so so what else are we probably born with\n[noise] so are we know that that intelligence has a a a big heritable component which doesn't mean that it is\nA completely determined by our genes but it doesn't mean that some of the differences among people can be attributed differences among their genes we know that the differences in personality how conscientious how agreeable how erotic how extroverted\nA are influenced by a by our genome and even behavioral traits such as ah how likely are you to be a smoker or alcoholic all of them show some influence of a of our genetic condemn it\nAnd even though we can now prove our genomes to actually test some of these things out to eat or drink or says there's another slightly bizarre old fashioned method\nSuch as looking at similarities between identical twins who are separated at birth\nBecause identical twins separated at birth share all of their genes but of course not\nTheir environments and they show that uh there is a a a pretty hefty statistical or influence of the genes that is if you know what one identical twin is like you can make a lot of predictions about the other one who he or she may never have met me growing up uh an ocean and the cultural way\nMy favorite example is a a pair of twins one who was brought up a as a Catholic and are not the family in Germany the other was brought up Jewish family in accented that when they walked into the lab and Minnesota fan wearing identical navy blue shirts with apple ...\nBoth of them like two different buttered toast and coffee both of them ... rubber bands around there is\nBoth of them flush the toilet before using it as well as after\nLike to a surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them John [laughter]\nSorry my seemed too good to be true\nOr when you Mr or batteries of\nPsychological pass a you get the same results namely identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities\nThat's just unbelievable so then like even things like like habits or or personality quirks are more or less assigned at birth\nWell they're they're influenced at birth I wouldn't say they're assigned because um there are probably some unpredictable changes that occur as the brain and gels and the first couple of years of life ah\nThere are changes that that to unfold over the lifespan whether they are a response to outside forces or if they're just the way that the the brain spontaneously develops we don't really know\nYeah there are certainly ways in which anyone can be damaged if you if you undergo a trauma or abuse that can leave lasting scars but I think there's certainly a um their statistical forces there's there's definitely pressure that makes one person different from another across the board\nYeah when when you think about like who you are I mean do you do you think you're the same person that you were when when you were a child or or a teenager or in your twenties as as you are now\nI I Do see myself as basically the same kind of person I like seeing music I like same foods I like the St pastimes I have I have similar kinds of interests\nAre and ... and research on personality shows that there was a a a substantial amount of continuity in a person's character ah as they go through life\nBut a ... there are certain changes that I see myself that probably occurred in most people as they as they get older we get less an erotic we get nicer\nAh we get less anxious as we get older all of us but still if one person is more anxious than another at the age of twenty uh he'll probably be more anxious than the other person at the age of Seventy as well even if both of them are less anxious across the board\nSending it if we are more or less the same right at at twenty or at Seventy is it even possible to make big changes to to who we are\nI think we have the capacity to change our behavior which is really what counts I I don't think that there's a lot of room to change who we are in the sense of a fundamentally nervous person becoming um constitutionally calm and I have easy going\nBut certainly there are methods of say cognitive behavior therapy that are politically effective at reducing anxiety and phobias in treating depression yeah uh\nAnd the thing is that that those don't appeal to a some if serial immaterial so they are our ways of acting on our neural circuitry\nWe kept to keep in mind that are neural circuitry ... intricately complex and has been shaped by evolution to interact with the world through our social um mechanisms of of interacting to language to facial expression the body language back there are ways of of changing our\nFeelings and thoughts by the old fashioned route of conversation and example and a ... and ... of evidence based psychotherapy\nSo there is the scope for for a range of behavior within the ... with a given personality type and we can ... the outside of the ... the genes make available to us\n[noise] do do you when you think about what what animated person do you think that it can be figured out pretty logically or do you think that huge parts of it or just mysterious\nHuge parts of it are are certainly mysterious because the interactions are so unfathomable complex yeah there are I\nTend to a hundred billion cells in the brain connected by a hundred trillion ... says and no one can keep track of all of them even in a computer simulation\nWe also know that chance plays an enormous role above and beyond the role of either genes or\nEnvironments or we can see this in identical twins who are brought up together not not the exotic cases of twin separated at birth but just the kind of twins at all of us know\nIf he knows a pair of twins you know that they're they're they're they're more similar than to people plucked off the street at random but they are unique individuals yeah there you won't you don't confuse them when once you know and sometimes they're not friends and sometimes they're not friends are indeed a\nNow how do you account for those differences it's not fair ... at least not the ones they inherited from their parents there could be some a few mutations that each one or idiosyncratic we acquired\nA it's not there by and large the environments because they grew up in the same parents the same school the same house the same older subs seemed younger sibs\nReally forced to the conclusion that uh there's an enormous role for a for a chance for the role of the dice in or who have become because ah\nTo people who have everything in common both the genes and the environmental level nonetheless don't turn out to be a distinguishable\nHarvard psychologist
