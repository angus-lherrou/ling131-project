Austin the time is twelve o'clock\nThis [noise]\nAnd radio our [noise]\nEach week groundbreaking hadn't talked\nLousy entertainment design\nIs that really stems from him never known that delivered and hadn't had conferences around the\nWorld if the human imagination we have to believe in possible the true nature of reality that and [noise]\nFrom NPR [noise]\nI'm Guy rise coming up the\nDefinition of food is something that sustains or nurses we all think we taste food and ... that's an illusion food processing completely changed\nOr we can change the way we live my thinking about why we grow things how do we grow things and we ... this episode the food we eat first this nice\nAnd well why we've got communities across America on your own credible is it I mean what can America in Japan\nAnd you say like how can I ask what can you tell them to do in order to incorporate some of the public space ... local really into\nThe heart of Christ Church\nWhere they invented a new form of terrorism it's called vegetable service and I believe it oh no people come from all over the world to poke around\nAnd outright fats Eva when that's not going [noise]\nBut he stops the conversation [noise] and you know we're not doing it 'cause we're bored [noise] we're doing it [noise] because we want to stop a revolution\nWhich I talked to this simple question you'd find unifying language the coast because age an income and co check that will help people themselves find a new way of living [noise] the spaces are riding them different let's think about the results they use different like\nInteract differently and the I don't want to be a tipping yes and the language would appear to fund [noise]\nMuch less just go to the supermarket pick up a plastic bag of lettuce or shrink wrapped Styrofoam tray of meat and get our home to make dinner but we don't always think about how that food got there or how certain forces shaped the choices we make in the supermarket so then the show ideas about\nHow we connect with food why we eat certain things and not others and with the future of food may look or rather tastes like [noise] one thing Pamela Hearst showed in Todd Martin was health food could spark a change in every part of people's lives\nPlant food tell people what that\nFrank go on Facebook asked them you know help themselves and that stops to reshape the look of the time and then the next day so that's the ... at the next day is\nLet's show people how to cook let show people how to grow that show people walks in season and then let's talk to some of our oldest citizens who knows how to do all that but nobody is bothering asking 'cause if you grow up seeing food all over the place in stock to connect with it and if you know what to do with it you are more likely\nTo think about if you can't support in your local market your local farmers your local you know food businesses rather than thinking not meaning anyhow nipping to the supermarket and buy something in a plastic packet flown all over the world\nI'm curious because like to be able to do some ... I mean that the north of England does not have like the the greatest farmland in the world trade\nWe snakes now is is very mild you know it's it's absolutely amount you know but we just talk about food to get people talking you know because [noise]\nShe led there'll be decreasing them that says land in many parts of the world that we can go down but we still need to feed us out so we need to think about can we go out and raise ... close it can come and go up besides the buildings but of course the cat\nAnd well I think it's that happened over the last nine years of people are suddenly out in their eyes to space and seeing their environments in a completely different\nWay and so he could grill said on that I did some testing so even in the north of England we can change the way we lead my thinking about why we grow things highly grow things in ...\nI'm totally moving to time more than in the summer [laughter] yeah it was great [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... that movement she started entire Martin and now in towns all around the world it's called incredible edible you can learn more about it in hands full head talking to Ted Ted dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay so fruits and vegetables in every corner and Todd Martin that's real food right but the problem is that in most modern supermarkets especially in America that is not what\nWe eat you know it's it's sort of ... hands how you define things but I Would say a minimum of forty percent of the of the stuff in American food markets wouldn't really qualify as food by the dictionary definitions ... percent wouldn't qualify sued well if you think of food food\nThan the definition of food is something that sustains nurses and the definition of nourishment is something that um increases your health so if something is not increasing your health but make you ill it doesn't really need the dictionary definition and food\nIs is food writer and cookbook author Mark Bittman his most famous cookbook actually one of the best selling of all time is simply called how to cook everything to hug you and airports [laughter]\nIt's happened had that not often but yeah it's happened\nAnyway as much as that most of what we eat today isn't real food but it wasn't always like that has marked man on the head stage\nA hundred years ago just what everyone was a local for every family had a cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of Europe [noise]\nThere was no snack food and until the twenties until Clarence birds I came along there was no frozen food\nMargarine didn't exist\nIn fact when margarine was invented several states pass laws declaring that have had to be died tank so we all know that it was a fake there were no restaurant chains\nHeating ethnic was unheard of unless you were asked\nIn those days there was no\nPhilosophy of food you just hate you didn't claimed to be anything fats carbs proteins they weren't bad or good there were food you a\n... hardly anything can pay more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the corn flakes hadn't been invented the pop tart to ... cheese whiz none of that stuff goldfish slap [noise]\nAnd again every one aide local in New York and orange was a common Christmas presents because they came all the way from Florida\nFrom the thirties on road systems expand the trucks took the place of railroads fresh fruit began to travel more are just became common in New York the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland\nThe effects of us are well known there everywhere and the deaths of family farms as part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good\nTomato even in summer\nEventually California produced too much food to shift fresh so it became critical to market can them frozen foods loss arrived convenience it was sold the proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework would have cut down on a variety of food rid as well many of us\nGrew up never eating a fresh vegetable I for one and I'm not kidding\nDidn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was Nineteen who needed it though me was everywhere what could be easier more filling her healthier for your family the boiling estate\nBut by then had or already raised unnaturally rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed there were forced to eat soy and corn they've troubled digesting those grains of course but that wasn't a problem for producers\nThanks to farm subsidies uh find collaboration\nBetween agribusiness in Congress soy corn and paddle became tank and chicken soon joined them on the throne\nLike that then I'll be back in just a minute to explain why those foods have stayed so dominant for so long\nAnd why our relationship to food could be on the brink of another big change and

S. D. A. and the FDA Nineteen Seventy seven the first dietary goals for Americans said eat less fat\nWell if you eat less that the food tastes like cardboard the food industry knew that so what they do they pumped into sugar and now I've heard this corn syrup was cheaper so they could do which Wow Let me give you an example of how this works ... my favorite product of all time lucky charms\nYeah they're magically delicious Hadar right why are there marshmallows in the box 'cause they're delicious secondary why isn't marshmallows in the box\n'cause they're fun to eat 'cause marshmallows or sheep and goats are expensive pick up more room in the box and they can sell them for more wow great business strategy\n[noise]\nSo everyone says education educate the public as you get off with tell what's going on\nExcept for one thing education has it worked for any other substance of the news that Nancy Reagan was just saying no work\nReally so\nWhere does that leave us everyone says wait a second don't tell me what to eat well you know what you've already been told what to eat\nWhere were you for the last forty years as your food supply was being changed under your nose where you're protesting then\nEveryone says get government out of my kitchen you know I don't want government my kitchen either unless there's somebody more dangerous already there okay so the real question is who the hell do you want in your kitchen the government who will take your freedom and your wallet\nOr the food industry who's already checking your freedom your wallet and your health\nThat's your only choice [noise]\n\nSome given that choice what do we do ultimately we have to figure out how the food industry can still make money selling real food\nAnd the answer is can they absolutely they can but not with the current business model the food industry grosses one trillion dollars a year in the United states\nOf that four hundred fifty billion of it is gross profit no health care costs in America total to point seven trillion dollars a year of which Seventy five percent\nIs chronic metabolic diseases of which Seventy five percent of that could be preventable if we would do something about our diet\nThat's one point four trillion dollars\nTriple what the food industry makes we spend triple cleaning up the food industry's mess than they actually make the bottom line is they're going to drive this bus till the wheels fall off the only answer\nIs real food we just have to figure out how to make it available and profitable for\nEveryone at by the way I'm assuming the sugar industry\nReally hate you sure yeah [laughter] intend words or less yeah they they they love me yeah\nThat's the way this works my job is to provide the science so that the public to make its own informed decision and then but not\nMany people are saying what you're saying I mean\nYou know look there's a lot of noise in the system for obvious reasons you've got all of these this ... of people with their own vested interests I have no vested interest other than taking care of children and seeing\nChildren get to adulthood to have a decent chance in life that's my vested interests and to be honest with you it ought to be everybody's vested interest\nSo are you just like totally anti sugar or do you like do you in college is still a little bit of course now and again the problem\nIs I'm for dessert yeah for dessert right but if you're going to have breakfast cereal with orange juice and a capri sun and\nA granola bar and that's all before three o'clock you know then you've got a problem\n[noise]\nEver less take is a professor at the University of California in San Francisco you can see his entire talk at head at NPR dot org were back in just a minute stay with us on the show today ideas about how we connect to food I'm Guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nHere part comes from ... central appraisal district now seeking Travis County citizens to serve on the appraisal review board next summer online applications for these compensated positions or do you know later in October twenty\nMore at apply A R B dot com communities appointing public radio I mean the authenticity K U T Ninety point\nFive membership drives officially sites on Monday but she can be kind of Nebraska K.
