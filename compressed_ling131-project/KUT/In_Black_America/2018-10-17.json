nominated actor I said I Know the you know if you've got nominated in your category and he said he didn't\nSo I went to his category the outstanding actor in a short form comedy a Web series and saw his name there and started screaming again\nAnd that's how we found out I Know for what were you born and raised I Am originally from Atlanta Georgia ACL and raised in World War I was growing up it you know it was great\nI didn't know anything else because that's where\nI was born and raised and all of my family was there and my parents were from a small town called ... um which is about three hours south of Atlanta\nAnd you know people talk about the humidity and how bad the humidity was there and I didn't know what they were talking about it until I moved out to California and then went back home one summer and stepped off the plane and it literally\nTook my breath away I enjoyed my time in New Orleans and they fear but I\nWanted to be a forensic psychologist and after I saw the ... track that they had me on I took my first science test cast it ... it but and I just decided I Would much rather be one on\nTV than in real life [laughter] so [laughter] I went back home and got my degree in theater\nSo when did you know the ... who didn't tune\nYou know honestly there were two two films\nThat really kind of sparks an interest in me the first one was Charlie and the chocolate factory and and I got to do a play in the fifth grade with my teacher Mr horn speech and I got to play Charlie the lead\nAnd then I remember my dad he took me to go see a couple of years later the five heartbeat and I fell in love with that movie it became one of my favorite movies and so acting was always something I\nLoved and was passionate about but as I got older I had convince myself that it wasn't a real job\nAnd it was this more or less something I could do on the side so that when I really kind of began to to focus on the forensic psychology um and then as I got older I realized like OK girl you this is a real job acting is a real job [laughter]\nAnd how did you did to pardon me\n[noise] um my team reached out to me for the audition and I went in an audition with the Ali and Thomas casting office they are amazing had the audition\nTo call back and then got the call that they want to me for the part\nWas the audition similar to the ...\n... yeah the audition was very similar and there was actually more in the dish and then there was in the final scene that we got to see on once rain but it was it was very similar there wasn't a whole lot taken out but there were a few things that were removed\nNow you're in season two of them so for a very normal for ... to ... just a short period of time in a series\nYou know according to all of the articles that I have seen

an audition is try to memorize the lines in the first thing I Try to do is\nUnderstand who this character is what the character wants in this scene overall what the care to watch the physically from the other person or people in the scene and so\nWhat what I Am proud of that I Do is that I Do take the time I can easily spend two three four hours on end audition and really just\nDiving into it and
