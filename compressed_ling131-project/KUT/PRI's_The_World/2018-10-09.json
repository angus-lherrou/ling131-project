[noise]\nI I Would imagine when you're talking to your patients about lifestyle changes that they might consider making people either tell you they're willing to\nExercise more eat a different diet or not do people believe it's possible to really get a handle on the amount of stress in their lives and and to improve the quality of the relationships in their lives\n[noise] well I mean it's very hard to do yeah uh and which is one of the reasons I think that the American Heart Association does not list\nEmotional stress as a key modify up little risk factor for heart disease if they still don't do that after so many years\nUm I think in part because it's easier to reduce cholesterol than it is a you know ... emotional and social disruption so ... it's it's not easy or but\nI think that um it's well worth the challenge um because it's it's very clear that um intense emotional disruption and chronic emotional destruction I'm can ah can affect her our hearts and in very very detrimental ways\nYou say that there's really no way to practice cardiac medicine without trying to understand where your patients are coming from emotionally how do you do that when they walk into your office for the first time\n[noise] uh you\nLet them talk [noise] uh you know most doctors um and probably I Do the same thing I'm\nA will interrupt or a patient um you know within\nSixteen seconds [noise] um so I uh especially now I um I make it a point to let the patient have free range of\nTalking about what's bothering them what's important to them um and non interrupt or and then\nYou know if we have to direct conversation to um you know some uh some treatment plan or you know than than we do that but it's very important I think for patients to feel like they were were hurt 'em and and a lot comes out in when patients are given a chance to just talk freely\nYou mentioned that I'm the sort of family lore\nOf of the death of your grandfather's one in particular really kind of formed you as a kid and made you interested in in cardiac medicine you also mentioned that you have children yourself I Wonder if you've tried to reframe that story of how heart disease kills people in your family\n[noise] [noise] well\nI think my son is is also fascinated by the heart ... uh we we were when you know I wrote about this briefly in the book uh you know early on we would uh I mean we would watch PBS special on heart disease and and it was a scene where someone was getting ... related and he was asked me fascinated by that him\nAnd we watch it and then I can turn it off because of the freedoms can affect him\nIn a bad way and then and then we end up watching it like the next day or so\nYou know ... you know like my children are very interested in in you know in the heart and\nYou know I think one of my fears when I was growing up is that that you know heart disease and sudden death just came out of nowhere and in a sense there is some truth to that and you know you can't really have no discernible heart disease and and and have your heart suddenly stop and that that is that does happen\nUm but I think that as I've learned more about uh the heart I I Believe that we have some agency and I try to communicate that to my kids up there are ways of um promoting\nHeart health you know yes you know don't smoke\nYou know eat well exercise but also you know pay attention to other people pay attention to your community pay attention to where you where you are and uh and and and pay attention to your relationships that's that's equally important those things are also a matter of life and death\nDoctors Sunday John ... is a cardiologist and writer his new book is called heart I history Sunday thank you so much for making this time for I\nThink he was my pleasure [noise] you can find our Twitter handle ... he are a think on Twitter obviously you can subscribe to pod cast and learn about upcoming shows I think that he R.
