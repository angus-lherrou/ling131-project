is less on the mechanics of citizenship that that's not unimportant\nBut to think underneath what it is that we hope citizenship accomplishes for us in order to have this conversation I think partly we have to think about what are the values what is the value of family today that same fourteenth amendment that gave former slaves integrity\nWith respect to their families is being used as a weapon or size separating families in our country in my view that is not a values sort of consonant with the role that citizenship should be playing\nMartha Jones a professor at Johns Hopkins and the author

on the tree of life synagogue\nI've been thinking a lot in the past forty eight hours about all those people who happen to be Jewish in my life who may know there were no hesitation about welcoming me into their family\nThat's Jose Antonio Vargas author of a new book dear America notes of an undocumented citizens murders was born in the Philippines and his lived in the U.S without papers since he was twelve Vargas was part of a team of journalists who won a Pulitzer Prize at the Washington Post in two thousand date when\nHe spoke with my colleague group ... you began by describing the role Jewish Americans have played in his life story\nWhen I got to this country and in the early nineties I I didn't really know anything about Jewish people and especially when it got to high school there was some family the green Steinway family it was the first time I've ever had a Jewish friend but I didn't know what that meant either\nA in a friend was Natalie Natalie weighed my classmate and then I ended up meeting her mom Gail Gail ... mom Rita and read us husband he lie and then they adopted me into their family and then when it got to the Washington Post I was assigned the professional mentor\nAnd his name was Peter Pearl and he taught me the meaning of the word match I didn't know that was and he was the first and only adult at the Washington Post that I told that I was really and he made a very\nCrucial decision that basically saved my career\nTo accept you coming out as undocumented yeah and I\nTold them everything the fake papers you know everything I had to do to live my way into a job with the Washington Post and I expected him to report me today charged department instead Peter said this is now or a shared problem don't tell anybody else just keep going [noise]\nYeah you describe in the book how you almost have to families wide apart from your actual family\nAnd the family of partially Jewish and other people they kind of helped you survive while being undocumented but then at home your family was frustrated with you for coming out is undocumented and you were getting these conflicting messages how did you navigate that\nWell I mean it was I think a lot of people who grew up in immigrant backgrounds can can relate to this because there's the there's the dynamic at home in a immigrant households\nThat were told that we should watch too much and she put her head down don't make too much noise we're here to just work we're not here to be this all to be seen [noise]\nAnd yet I had this other family that was mostly for my high school ... high school and then Peter Pearl the Washington Post who just want me to succeed in all the waste could succeed you know it's like if I didn't have all those people in my life\nWho told me to keep going right to these immigration laws didn't make any sense at all I'm not sure I Would have allowed myself\nTo being courage and to kind of pursue what I wanted to do\nWell is that an important point to make that American citizens helped you survive and thrive in this country\nBecause when we talk about undocumented people like me in this country it's almost as if we exist\nLike islands onto ourselves when the reality is people like me in this country cannot be in this country working living surviving thriving without all those us citizens who help us out at every juncture at school\nAt work at the church and yet when we talk about immigration special illegal immigration the role of us citizens are are actually not much part of the conversation\nWe're looking at this quote unquote care than coming up from yeah Central America and the president saying we're not going to let them in and things like that one thing you did in your book is explain the history up and to the point of your own name and how\nYou ended up being part of the family that wanted to come to the states and how it was influenced by the west can you tell that story\nI think that when we explain white people move to America or white migrants are moving to Europe I think we have a very simplistic way of doing it in America which is what I Know people assume that migrants know about the statue of liberty or the American dream\nI didn't know anything about that owning you was when I was a kid America was coke was Nike he was spam it was the first she's kisses it was all the stuff that my grandparents in America who are naturalized citizens you know set to the Philippines to my mother and I\nSo American Capitalism was there was was very presence since I was a kid McDonald's was their right\nAnd I think we don't kind of interrogate what American foreign policy and American economic policy in addition to the wars that we fight that we thought what those reasons have to deal with white people move\nYou know I was I was in North Carolina a few years ago when I was doing his Tea Party that\nAnd I ended up saying that there are four million Filipinos in America where the third largest immigrant group Mexicans Chinese and ...\nAnd this man got up elderly white man and he said why there's so many of you here and I said well you know sir we are here because you were there the Spanish American war my name is a product of\nSpanish colonialism will say ... but has said that seem to have an accent and to eat because when the Americans took over after the Spanish American war\nThere typewriters didn't have accent works so my name is a marriage of Spanish colonialism in American imperialism\nUm just to circle back to the beginning we started out talking about the people who helped you become on line and go places where\nPeople wouldn't think you'd be able to go like the Washington Post newsroom and now we have this a synagogue that was attacked people who did help refugees I mean do you think people are still helping young people like you and there can citizens are still playing that role and do you think that's going to change\nAbsolutely they're helping I Know this [laughter] I Know this because they follow me on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and they suddenly messages\nI Know this because if it weren't for the generosity\nOf all these people including choose who know a lot about homeland and search for\nIf it wasn't for that generosity I don't really know why the sky hasn't fallen by the time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people I have to believe\nThat we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific tragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nWith

GBH here in Boston\nOperation faithful patriot that is the name of the Pentagon has chosen for the deployment this week of more than five thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border a deployment ordered by President Trump just days ahead of the mid term elections\nThe president says the troops are needed to protect the country from an invasion of migrants he's referring to that group of thousands of migrants from Central America currently making its way north through Mexico the migrants by the way are still more than a thousand miles away from the U.S border and they're not expected to arrive there for weeks\nThe president's critics are dismissing the deployment as a political stunt ahead of the midterm so what practically can those troops do\nDo you know harkens is a reporter with the defense new site military dot com a dean of the defense department likes\nMission so what does the mission of these troops\nWhile the request actually came down from the department of homeland security and it sounds like we're going to be happening with these active duty force that is that they're going to be staying border patrol agents on the ground\nSo they're going to have the military police unit will combat engineers maybe Asian to court and medical personnel who can exist at the border patrol agents I got to try to address this caravan it that makes its way toward the U.S border\nThe defense department has made clear these troops will be carrying live ammunition ... what's the justification for that\n[noise] well apparently a secretary of defense Jim Mattis made that call and as long as the troop normally carry weapons they're authorized to do so on that particular mission\nNow it it doesn't sound likely that they're actually going to be coming face to face with any of these people it sounds more like they're going to be at the thing that border patrol agents and their mission and they'll actually be the ones on the front lines so that's a little unclear\nSo the president as a commander in chief there's nothing legally to prevent him from doing this but once the troops go to the border what legal authority governs what there'll be able to actually do\nThey do you face some legal restrictions as part of the past they commit ... and that dates back to the Eighteen hundreds but basically limits troops from carrying out domestic policies inside the you at\nNow there are some there is some wiggle room in that a U.S northern command which department of homeland security is called to send these troops down to the border has some authority to partner with agencies like that when it comes to defending a U.S security interests from inside the U.S\n[noise] there are already several hundred National Guard troops on the border so why doesn't the president ask for more guards rather than going straight to regular forces\nThat wasn't really clearly addressed during yesterday's press conference and it's a good question uh there are as you mentioned about twenty two hundred I Believe National Guard troops along the border and they've been in place since early this spring\nThose trips are mostly unarmed and there are there also is this thing you know the customs and border patrol agents on on the border\nA President Trump in an interview with Fox News last night made an interesting comment that previous presidents have called up the national guard but he's actually called up the military and it's really one in the same you know\nThere are a part of the military so it's a little unclear why I'm President Trump wants active duty forces and play for national guardsmen it it could be for\nUm maybe a political deal with it\n[noise] ... the other thing is that critics have been saying is that the deployment is going to negatively impact training and readiness or what have you heard from your sources of both um\nWell I think that is a definitely a concern you know when troops are in their home bases they are typically training and they're they're gearing up for a whatever deployment they're going to be carrying out next taking them away from that mission and putting them on the border\nThat take them away from you know not only training in the field but also some of the military education that they need to carry out to further their careers and some of their other requirements so it is a fair point\nDo you know has any one of the Pentagon discuss how the selected the name of this operation faithful patriot ... doesn't so I'm totally random [laughter]\nI have not heard anything about how the name uh came came about\nJuno hurricanes with military dot com thanks very much thank you for having me\nThe most terms and immigration and remain top of mind for President Trump less than a week from election day today though he made room on a schedule to travel to Pittsburgh\nIn the wake of the attack on a synagogue there on Saturday to visit with controversial even before he landed the rabbi the tree of life synagogue welcome the president\nThere were also protest from some members of Pittsburgh Jewish community is that Trump was not welcome we also noticed that the reaction in Israel after the attack expose them devise between Jewish communities there and here in the U. S. we\nAsk Dina craft about this she's a reporter for the newspaper Haaretz and based in Tel Aviv\nReaction on the official level one where am I ... you know condolences and shock\nBut there was also a lot of center the ... ear going on I mean starting with the chief rabbi Israel the ... chief rabbi who ah refused to refer to the tree of life synagogue conservative synagogue in Pittsburgh to attack as a synagogue he said it had some sort of essence of Jewish character but he would not call it a synagogue\nAnd why not call it a synagogue\nBut for the ultra orthodox establishment which he represents in Israel conservative and reform Jews or or or reconstruction issues or any Jews or not worked at ox Jews are not really considered full Jews in their eyes [noise]\nSo what do you attribute some of these ten ear reactions as he put it to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think it's cynical politics and you have somebody like enough Taliban at who's the diaspora administer a officially he's also former aide of\nNetanyahu and now turned rival and uh he tries to always play to a base it's even more right wing the nets on Yahoo and she should I Would argue no better but yet he's still found a way to compare the hand\nThat shot down eleven Jews praying on established morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza into Israel I Am ah which I think also shows like a disconnect and a completeness understanding of history\nYeah I mean not totally but it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. so Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWanted the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and knows and civic anti Semite so usually not me not singing on college campuses they're promising the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's all single life whether it's social life yeah\nUm I think here again it's really Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America I think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from whole support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic policies important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel in the trunk or the strong Israel\nSo and Ron dreamers comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI'm over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the expressions of shocking to hire\n... did you kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nThat has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did like you know hiding out from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend\nAnd a place where you would playing kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share story I did I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where all hell\nAnd I'm One of the stories that move me most of the story of", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "30"}
