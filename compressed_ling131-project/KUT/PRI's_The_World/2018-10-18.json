{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "And often within that population that's a lot to a large extent the folks that I come from\nUm there is I'm a I think I'm a more deeply progressive streak or a the the seeds of a a leftist populism versus the the populism that has been successful in the last couple of years in the among that demographic certainly on the right to\nTrump at the helm and I think that part of it is for decades the I'm a conservative end of the the um American political spectrum has been very\nUm directly I guess kind of claiming the the cultural touchstones of the place that I come from and so\nYou know and and validating those things so whether it's um you know pick up trucks or or a a sense of patriotism about the American flag or um the there is a an acknowledgement of just to say you know the\nParty has been signaling to people in those places for whom that's their reality that they rarely see portrayed in popular culture or even the news media in any\nUm you know a dignified way there there is a signaling today and we see you and that you know regardless of of your your politics on the issues and heck a lot of people frankly [laughter] couldn't even um articulate them but they but that since that psychological sense of being validated by one party\nUm goes a very long way and the way that our politics work actually has a lot less to do with rational thought than it has to do with\nUm research will tell us um our social groups and it and it's largely an emotional and irrational business and so I think that that's part of it and and so on the other side I Would say that the Democratic party has failed by that measure to\nUm be showing up in those spaces and um and validating those pieces of our country and and so I think that's\nTo vet now if we're going to talk about the actual the ideologies that that run as currents through the and Republican and democratic parties\nUm rural life is just by definition a largely and individualistic pursuit and board I mean by that is you are often geographically isolated from places where government ... you know scoops the snow and police patrol the sidewalks here\nA on a well earned and deserved sense of pride about doing stuff yourself and that strain the rural psyche or experience just correlate more with conservative ideas about individual is I'm\nI'm now if we can broaden our view and see all the ways in which rural America also is like downright socialist in some ways like you share about which I mean you know you um you\nMight um uh like my small rural perishing in Kansas had this communal space where we would all come together and share pie or whatever\nAnd um there or just the way the neighbors rely on one another um\nYou know if you're the farmer two miles away breaks down his his tractor is stuck in in the field and you you go help\nNow whether government should serve such a real or not is is um for for people to decide for themselves but I Do think that at the core of rural life there are a lot of touchstones of liberalism to that\nThat may be the Democratic party has has overlooked tapping into\nThis just think I'm ...\nI'm a we have actually since you mentioned your parish ah we have an email from misty wanted to know um what role religion played in your family story\n[noise]\nWell uh I was I I Am as I say a cradle Catholic and I had you know my all my Sacramento from baptism to confirmation were were done by the same priest and um\nAre so we're definitely I'm deeply culturally Catholic there was not the really like the cross pollination with politics that I see now in that church and many other aspects of Christianity I'm\nSo by that I mean you know we saw each other every Sunday Morning and our tiny little church that my\nUm own grandfather help repair the people on but we will no one was telling us how to vote and I think that there is a little bit more conflicting between religion and politics in the last couple of decades and was the case for me as a rural Catholic and Kansas\nUm but you know I think it was for us it was mostly it was it was our community pillar that little church in the context of\nThe economic demise of the place that was happening in real time as you know businesses were closing and farms are going under the church held true and we showed up and fight each other every Sunday there and while a lot of the people in those ... might not have even believed in the dogma\nOf the church um it provided a shared space where we got together and I'm Jenny afflicted and and um had a shared sense of belonging\nYou're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd how's your move into the middle class created any distance any social distance between yourself and and members of your family or your extended family ...\nI don't think so and maybe the reason is that I don't while I I absolutely agree that that assessment is accurate um I don't experience it that way and I don't think of myself as um you know having formerly been part of one class and now part of the other\nI think that you know we we talk about class has this kind of a ladder as is often the the um visual metaphor that we use\nAnd I don't think it's really it that's not how we experience it is not actually the as an individual you quote unquote get out of our own place and then you arrive in another because\nYou know the the deepest truth of who I Am come from that that place that that we as Americans call poverty and and I'm and many of them are gifts and they're\nUm simultaneously now is this is my reality today I'm with the the privilege of of being hurt as as a college educated journalist\nAnd I just I kinda hold those truth simultaneously and and you know when I leave here I Will have text messages from my family who are very much you know uh the working poor of America\nAnd uh we have the same kind of conversations we've had since I was a kid and and I go to New York for some of my business and I go to public radio station and talked to good people like you and it it all just kind of world around simultaneously so now I\nI don't think there has been a distance um it's a code switching as we talked about earlier but um but all the same people that I've always loved her are still in my life\nSarah ... is author of the book heartland a memoir of working hard and being broken

is also responsible for some of the worst human rights violations in the world\nThat is what this man this defector from North Korea\nIs up against as he tries to alleviate the suffering of other North Koreans but story comes to us from our WG be partners of the ground truth project and reporter Kelly\n... we're outside of ... apartment building in southern soul getting ready to head over to an island along the border of North Korea\nBut it was clear right away that he was having a little trouble waking up\nThis er junk stomach hurt\nFrom drinking is a\nLittle on the\nRun up I've interviewed Mr Jong before and this is the first time that he's ever been hung over but somehow it's a perfect portrayed on them on one hand he's living large drinking too much whiskey and enjoying being a grandfather\nHe's fifty six years old and re next is Korean valid in his spare time\nMainly\nMom nice\n\nOn the other hand Mr Jong is haunted by his past\nHe's dedicated his free life the one that began when he made it to South Korea to helping people still in the north and he's found himself on the world stage at a defining moment in the history of the Korean Peninsula\nTown on the go to\nWhen he's not in his day job at a furniture store\nHe's running an organization called no change for North Korea it's a ragtag group of North Korean defectors and some supporters they raise money

food rations and they watch propaganda movies together in the evening\nWhen you go like this one about your hands brutal occupation of the Korean Peninsula\nWhen he was about Seventeen he joined the military for mandatory ten years' service when he got out his parents arranged marriage and the government signed him up pretty desirable job as a traitor of goods to China\nHe had two daughters and life look promising\nThan Kim Jong il took over the country in the Nineteen nineties as a horrible famine swept through North Korea conservative estimates say about a quarter of a million people starve to death\nMr John was able to keep feeding his family because his job as a traitor gave them easier access to the black market but do you remember the horror of watching children waste away and the streets\nWhen was your ... your ... and\nSo whenever she goes to work you could see a body of people piled up on the street who's tied up hunger\nLate one night in Nineteen Ninety nine Mr John was
