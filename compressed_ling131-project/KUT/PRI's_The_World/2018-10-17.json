{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Think about that one it's got an ... billion dollar a technology or a year technology infrastructure and Seventy billion of it that it just spent keeping up these ancient legacy systems from the sixties it really is you know it's not an environment it's easy to get things done in\nSo the the kinds of people who insist on coming to it and still get things done are incredible um they are people who are there for a mission and you're right it is one of the things in one of the patterns\nIt is that I'm not that wouldn't notice this is a fellow named max star who has a ... a nonprofit called partnership for public uh for for the public service and it is I said a un organizations devoted to try to fix the federal government\nAnd and attract young talented the federal government and one of the things he max noticed is that the ... some of the people doing the most incredible things to sell government our children of immigrants and why because they come from countries that don't have stable governments and they know what happens if it doesn't work\nRealize how important the mission is but apart from them you go into places like the national weather service and what you find are people who\nWho are developed a passionate interest in the weather when a tree fell in their house in a storm when they were nine years old and have devoted their lives to the ... the business of of keeping people safe from the weather and that's why they're there and they care about it and they're willing to\nWork for a third of what they're making the private sector and that still alive and well we just need to nurture it\nAll right let's go back to the phones now our number one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to Kevin is on the line in bend Buckeye Kevin\nI thank you for taking my call Cher so um it seems to me that food has to be very pleased to see all the chaos and and disruption in our government agencies\nAlso Steve Bannon famously talked about wanting the federal government should be um um destroyed if you like um as as an agenda item for him to what extent beyond just in common and it's a\n... um the transmission and and the fact that you already mentioned he think either of those issues\nMight have some um involvement in what's going on\nSo I can and are you asking is this on purpose this just aren't yeah thanks for calling\n... ... ... so if it's a good question I think when you sit Bannon\nDown as I have and ask him I'm\nLike what what exactly do you want to destroy and you start you want to destroy the physicist who take care of the nuclear bombs no didn't want to do that do you want to get rid of the weather service no you don't want to do that that it was a veg rallying cry rather than a specific set of proposals for what to do with this enterprise\nAnd you you're right you're right that no one should be happier about what's happening then our worst enemies because this government of ours is not just a tool for for dealing with\nProblems it is the only tool for dealing with some of the most pressing problems\nAnd it is responsible for all kinds of good stuff we all benefit from that we just take for granted is responsible for an awful lot of the technological innovation is going on in this society we don't get the Internet or GPS ah ah without without early stage investments we don't get much of the biotech industry we don't get\nA we don't get a lot of what our economy turns on without the state being actively involved as it has been and ... and ... intelligently involved so when you look if you're sitting in from the outside of the United states and you're thinking how wide gum them up how do I weaken them\nThe first place you would go is to the federal government um so I ... ... ... you're right about that do I think that Trump himself\nIs like some mastermind were working for the Russians trying to dismantle this enterprise the ... the only reason I Would say no\nIs that if you were a mastermind trying to dismantle an operation you'd actually want to learn something about it uh I mean there are ... he's actually doing only a haphazard\nJob of undermining it and it is not put in ... with the Barry Myers is an exception Barry Myers is someone who really knows enough about the weather service to cause damage but Scott Pruitt if the EPA a as many people pointed out to me it was a it was a blessing that he knew so little about it because he could have caused so much more damage\nAnd I say so I think that that speaks to just\nAt the motive being a a kind of neglect indifference obsession with other things are than an actual conscious attempt to dismantle government\nMistake I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right so what are the challenges in your opinion Michael to appropriately\nReef staffing all these ... agencies either two years or six years from now when another administration takes up in the White House\n[noise] um so a couple of things um\nOne is there is a kind of like it's a bizarre silver lining but it's a silver lining up until the moment Trump actually threatens enterprise with with destruction that threatens the to really dismantle the government\nIn various ways uh it's not interesting enough for people to pay attention to I mean I wasn't paying attention to it\nAnd what we were as its think of it is it's like a squeeze it machine import especially important machine that had been allowed to Rustin rest interest for Thirty years and then someone comes in with a sledgehammer\nThe wresting doesn't interest engage any of us but when a sledgehammer starts being wielded against it we start to pay attention to it so I think as you know he's electrified the material and this I think\nIs an opportunity for public education which might lead to renew all\nThe the ... before you reach staff all these play before you come in and kind of try to repair the damage um they really need it it's not going to happen unless there's a change in the narrative um so the narrative has been the government's the problem that the solution\nOr it's you gotta get get it off our backs\nAnd it's going to require and this is why I wrote the book or it's going to require people to see that the government can be the solution and someone can sell who can sell that idea getting himself into the White House to attract the kind of people who you'll need to fix the mess that's being left behind that finished by saying\nI ... I interviewed a senator or I won't name him because I Can't remember whether it was even on the record but I was just talking to about how problematic it is from his point of view trying to\nTo to make sure the proper funding goes to the proper places in the government when the White House has not asking for it\nAnd he was saying you know I'm afraid I'm gonna spend the he was a young senator the rest of my career repairing the damage that created and that might be true [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk Michael really interesting ... thanks so much for making time for us to\nHave any [noise] if you'd like to tell us on Twitter handle is ... ...

I mean what you've been describing is a very deliberate charm offensive by mum had been some on to get us investment into Saudi Arabia so wouldn't be very surprising if the Saudi Government sponsored a hit on July ... of all the signs appointed to that\nMarket you're not the only one scratching your head I have been walking around for days\nWondering why they would do something as stupid as this but it seems that this is in fact what has happened and it it goes back to what people have said about Mohammed bin Salman style that he is\nThat he sees Saudi Arabia as a top ... your country and looking around the world he sees the Russian government bumping off people who they don't like the Turkish government is the leading jailer of journalists in the world the Chinese have disappeared the head of Interpol\nAnd can find a million ... says are Muslim Chinese in concentration has\nNone of those governments have paid a price\nSo one can imagine the Saudis thinking that they wouldn't pay the price for chilling journalist I think it was a a a terrible miscalculation on their part but one can imagine that is the way in which they perceive the world around them and their place in it\nSteven Cook of the council on Foreign Relations his latest book is false dawn protest democracy and violence in the new Middle East thanks very much Steven thank you mark of as I mentioned earlier there's also a lot of Saudi money invested here in the U S Eliot brown of the wall Street Journal has been looking into that and what's at stake\nSo first of all what do we mean by Saudi money are we talking about the country's own money or money invested by private\nBusinesses and people\nYes the former so it's actually out of this fund that they have called the public investment fund which is Saudi sovereign money it's called the sovereign Walton spends the country's money in its country and around the world\nSo how much money are we talking about in the sovereign wealth fund invested in the U.S and us markets in businesses\nSo it's a little hard to track precisely what you know it's in the order of low tens of billions of dollars what we calculated this is just relating to start ups which is sort of the the biggest chunk of investment they happen to us that we can find is in the order more\nThan ... billion so far\nSpread around pretty wide variety of companies\nYeah where do they put their money like how does the Saudi sovereign investment fund a different from say a like a pension fund\nSo if they actually work relatively similar where they'll give orange chunks of money to individual companies and it just takes takes in them and then often not have too much saying how the company works so some companies people will have heard of a they\nOwn a steak and Tesla they own a large steak around ... percent and over\nAnd then there's a very large chunk that has gone to a different fun run by the Japanese company softbank\nAnd they've given them forty five billion dollars to spend on start ups in tech companies around the world so that's where a large portion of of their us investment has has found its way is through the sufferings on\nYeah and as you've looked at the where this money goes what sectors of the U.S economy are the Saudis invested in most heavily\nSo ... most heavily it's taxed\nAnd start ups at that because a couple of years ago the crown prince in Saudi Arabia decided to really sort of take some of their money is derived from oil and their wealth and try to invest in the future economy sort of out of the realization that\n... in the future oil will run out people will shift to electric cars or people just stopped by oil and they will need and waited for by their own economy\nSo we've long known about the the kind of money for human rights trade off with Saudi Arabia prior to this episode with Jim ... I'm ... how stoked wouldn't Americans started to get Saudi money would they be happy about it so I think it ... they certainly aren't\nVery eager to talk about it right now those that have taken it we reached out to twenty two of them and the only one that got back\nWas over a my sense is that generally they had been sort of believing hoping that the crown prince was a reformer\nAnd Saturdays darker days were behind it um but they also probably just didn't think about it much because they were offering a lot of money and a lot of it was coming through a different party that being the suspects on them and\nSo Elliott relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia become strained how could these massive investments be impacted\n[noise] so the ones that are already invested such that they over investor I'd rather have a port seat on the company I I think it's sort of what's done it done it it's not like a campaign contribution where it's easy to ... on it\nThe question that we're interested in is what's gonna happen going forward for a lot of the tech sector a lot of a start up sector\nWhich has been sort of expecting a lot more Saudi money to be the rain down on it through the soft banks on which has been really powering valuations and a frenzy out here and so rally and so if if there's a lot more strained relations if it becomes toxic to accept Saudi money\nThat could sort of slow things down out here in Silicon valley\nJust slow them down I mean could U.S companies forced the Saudis to divest if they suddenly saw the real liability it possibly if it's a pretty difficult\nMechanism that would have to happen for that are especially with private companies you know it's sort of hard to see how that would even a happened but I'm a lawyer ... but yeah I Do think it's more of a sort of going forward type thing\nAnd if the relations between the U.S in Saudi Arabia became really strength would it make any sense for Saudi Arabia to\nLike divest itself in order to maybe hurt the U.S economy\n... you could see that I mean in in the trade war with China that we've seen sort of pulling investment\nAs a lever a negotiation and certainly just in the past few days it seemed like the Saudis have tried to sort of hurt some of the companies that have pulled out of their conference or at least send a message to them but yet it is a bit of a guessing game here\nElia brown with Wall Street journal really appreciate your time thank you thank you [noise]\nSo can the U.S economy run without Saudi oil\nStick around the world the world is supported by as low dedicated to those who make build and do more offering mobile business banking with tools for freelancers and entrepreneur including built in ... mobile deposits in online account set 'em learn more at A.

S. and Saudi oil and for that we turned to Jeff Colgan at Brown university\nStarting point the price of oil right now well it's\nA trading roughly Seventy two dollars a barrel or these days it could rise and it's going to depend on some things that are like fundamentals you know how much oil is being applied to the market or not\nBut that claim in the op ed is is wrong I actually the United states is not vulnerable it's caught on me it's not seriously vulnerable to Saudi oil news the United states\nProduces more than half of the oil it consumes these days [laughter] and of the oil that it imports only ten percent of that comes from Saudi Arabia directly wow temper down\nJust ten percent so it makes so Canada is our number one supplier and is a far more important player and while Saudi Arabia as significant for global oil prices which affect the United states economy it's not the case the United states is vulnerable to it\nAnd so these kinds of threats from Saudi Arabia or not terribly credible and can largely be disregarded\nI'm just curious where does Saudi rank global in terms of oil exports he says\nThe threat that the Saudis are making is that they can cause havoc in global oil prices are raising the price of oil overall which would in turn affect the price of us oil and that way it's you know increase gasoline prices at the pump et cetera\nAnd so that's the threat they're making but it's just not terribly credible because to do that they need to cut their own production\nGoing to hurt them financially so to raise the price up they have to cut their own uh and so they might be able to kind of that I watch uh uh in the short term or without losing too much money but they're going to lose politically and they're going to lose the reputation as a reliable supplier of oil\nSo let me just pursuit two scenarios with the U.S living without Saudi oil proposal um ten percent with the U.S would go where to kind of short that up in Canada\nThe U.S imports from a huge number of countries and so it could import more from Canada it could import from\nMexico or for Norway or from other Middle Eastern countries ... the global oil market is actually very fungible I'd think of it as sort of a bath tub with lots of oil pouring in from different ways and it all becomes kind of one big pool and then buyers ... stock markets to select their oil off of that and so\nLosing Saudi Arabia oil for the United states would really not be such a big problem because there's always another buyer available\nAnd the U.S were to say we can live without Saudi oil and Washington cuts way back its ties with Riyadh um what was that due to security in the region because Washington events on Saturday for some measure of regional stability right\n[noise] yes uh an and here's where I think that you ... the United states needs to walk a fine line because we don't want to go too far with this I think the U.S Saudi relationship has been one historically that has tamped down a interstate conflict in the region\nIt's a very volatile regions of course it doesn't look so good but there's nonetheless an effort by us and Saudi Arabia to reduce conflict\nBut lately and this is under the new crown prince new as a couple of years ago in Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudis have been much more belligerent causing all kinds of trouble in the region including this sort of humanitarian disaster in Yemen but also hostility with neighboring cutter and ramping up hostilities with those neighboring countries and so\nTraditionally United States administrations have talked to Saudi Arabia and said listen we don't want that kind of instability stopped doing that\nBut the Trump Administration has given them a much freer rain and that's caused some real problems\nDo you think that the war in Yemen is in some ways maintaining the relationship between us in Saudi Arabia and that there are arms deals in there that Washington likes\n[noise] well I think look defense contractors like selling to Saudi Arabia there are a big purchaser\nOf weapons there's no question about that but I wouldn't want to draw to clear a line about that the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia has always principally been about oil and us has looked for cooperation from the Saudis on oil markets\nAnd what's changing now is that the U.S has a lot more ability to say listen Saudi Arabia you need to respect what we're saying to you and and to to work towards peace and stability in the region or we will cut you lose and we can do that because\nYou're actually not able to leverage against us and the oil market nearly as much as you might have been in the past\nJeff Colgan is the author of Petro aggression when oil causes war is also a professor at Brown thanks very much for being with us Jeff\nIt's been the Tom story in India Today a government minister resigned after being accused of sexual harassment during his previous career as a prominent journalist an editor\nAnd Jay Akbar as accuses are more than a dozen senior women journalists colleagues he'd worked with as editor several Indian publications Akbar denies the charges and does even filed a defamation lawsuit against one of the journalists Priya Romani she says she looks forward to seeing him in court\nThis one case as part of something bigger though over the past week the me too

pulled the lid off the problem or did the women just spontaneously start talking there cruise\nBut I think since the beginning of last year the me too movement which began in Hollywood it did gain momentum across the guilt India started\nTalking about it but what she wants to pick up ... is an account of the young woman who talked about how students they just stand up comedian and that actually
