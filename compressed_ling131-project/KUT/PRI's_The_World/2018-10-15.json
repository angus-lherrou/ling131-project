{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Hey Hi yeah on equal often um I for putting me on the show is fantastic uh interview fantastic show thank you so much um my question is not about a impeachment exactly my question is is a\nInvestigation comes back with something of a smoking gun and it's pretty obvious um that are allergic or something was going on with the Russian a campaign of with a Russian mhm is there a mechanism for and I know that on election\nInteresting question no uh there is not a whatsoever or if if it is found that the majority of the majority of the Senate feels that something was done that meets the standard for impeachment Mike Pence is your vice president excuse me my friends as your president now I I Will say well what's really amazing to me about that question is\nWhat evidence could we possibly think of today\nThat would be the equivalent of the smoking gun in Nineteen Seventy three Seventy four because\nAt that point for the president's it with their own ears discussing crimes that he was trying to cover up that was convincing guessing in two thousand Eighteen and our partisan world um where as Rudy Giuliani say facts are not facts truth is not truth\nUm where we can easily photo shop any picture and we can easily forge any documents I'm I'm genuinely as a citizen hard pressed to think of what evidence could appear\nThat with the supermajority of the senators and a super majority of Americans would be convinced by that evidence I think that if there was if you will smoking gun evidence that appears today it's quite likely that you have some news networks screaming their heads off about how guilty but he is and other news networks saying\nThat's clearly forged it's not true don't believe it\nAnd it would choose the matter is a ... a less we get a super majority to come down one Saturday other that's a recipe\n\n\nMy guest is Jeffrey angle we're talking about his book impeachment in American history you're listening to think I'm Chris Lloyd\nDo you see evidence Jeffrey that them all our investigation is is timing itself so that it is released after the November midterm election yes I think that that's the ... of all the things that we\nThe smoke and mirrors of the of the mother investigation behind closed doors that seems to be the most obvious the FBI and the Justice Department have\nClear rules that you're not supposed to make anything that could influence an election I think Ninety Days before an election maybe forty five days but before the election you're not supposed to come out the rules are very sick\nI'm One of the things that's critical about remembering why there is a bipartisan um discomfort with James Comey is that he directly violated that rule back in twenty sixteen by coming out with a politically important\nNotice days before the election that he was reopening the trial of a ... to ... the um investigation for Hillary Clinton um so I think there's no way I Would bet my last dollar that Mueller's team would not reveal something or indict someone between now and\nThe day it\nHere All right ah let's go next on the phone to I've had\nA taking my call and my question is is I live in California and the early ... and at that time is when governor Gray Davis was recalled so they didn't paycheck that had a recall and state voted to recall him and he was put out of office and Schwarzenegger and\nI'm Wondering if you know anything about what went on that and also it anything like that happen or on the national scale of the United states\nFor that to having a national scale read first need to rewrite the constitution there simply is no mechanism in the constitution that we have now for having any kind of\nDo over vote if you will um there's a mechanism of impeachment which means we're moving a guilty president or excuse me between conviction removing guilty president um and then it's very clear it's next guy up just like in football I'm Mike Pence will become part of the United states and they would have to find a new vice presidents in case something happened to him\nUm there's no way that the public if you will can remove a president of their own volition with their own will with their votes until the next election\n[noise] um you say absence of virtue in our president is the best sign we might have that the founders would want at president impeached um what do you mean my absence and\nBirch it well the reason they went back to George Washington is that they all could trust at the end of the day that\nNo matter what he did no matter what decisions he made even if it was when they disagreed with the new the he had the best interests of the country at heart and when they see the country I mean the entire country all Americans not just people's his own political persuasion um the founders believed much in many ways like a a sovereign king\nThat the president's responsibility was to take care of the nation as a whole therefore they found the presidents who they thought was thinking about other things in the nation as a whole they weren't sure that he was thinking about\nUh the nation as a whole first and foremost a he was pressed concern with his political party arresting sharing with themselves perhaps concern with his own bank account or with his own ability to stay out of jail\nThat if you start making decisions for himself or herself instead of for the nation\nThat's the absence of virtue that would really have set off warning bills for them\n[noise] um it's also pretty there that you don't think that in any case no matter what the circumstances that any impeachment and rent subsequent ... and conviction and subsequent rule removal from office will unify the country at least it never has so far\nNo it's it's been quite the opposite I think we're living in hyper partisan times today and historically when ever we have an impeachment trial it divides people for the very reason I mean let's stop and think would impeachment really is impeachment is ... popular will the will of the people\nOur country is based upon the will of the people that we elect our leaders to make decisions on her behalf where republic but we do that through popular sovereignty\nIf you then impeaching convict someone you were saying to the voters what you decided that the polls no longer is valid now maybe no longer valid for a very good reason but that is the threshold that we're going to cross so anyone who voted for Donald Trump if he is impeached and convicted\nYou're basically saying to him man did you make a mistake and Americans don't like to be told that um they'd rather have a do over if you will and the next election rather than be told that they have to forfeit if you will\nVery briefly was it a mistake for Gerald forward to pardon Richard Nixon\n[noise] it was exactly a mistake for Gerald Ford I actually think in retrospect you know this was many years later it was exactly a good thing for the nation because of exactly what you said the nation was divided the nation was torn up and he thought especially in the middle of an inflation crisis in the middle of post Vietnam and the middle of the energy crises\nAs a nation didn't need the divisiveness of a trial and he thought he would put the nation if you will virtue Wesley above his own political future\nAnd he paid the price for definitely Jeffrey a angle is founding director of the center for presidential history at Southern Methodist university and co author of the new book impeachment in

giant ball of concrete on the Arctic Circle you're going to find out today on the world\n\n... senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thank you so much\nGood to talk my pleasure thanks for having me boom\n\nBoom and oh\nA big election yesterday in the German state of Bavaria things did not go well for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her already strained coalition Merkel's party of the Christian Democrats has a sister party in Bavaria the Christian social union and\nThat party lost its long held absolute majority in Bavaria yesterday another ally the Social Democrats also fared badly the big winners the center left Green Party and the far right AFDC the alternative for Germany party Melissa Eddie is the Berlin Correspondent for the New York times\nI think what we're seeing here is that migration itself remains a really hot button issue on the one hand you have the far right that has pushed back against the migration issue\nBut at the same time that has galvanized I wouldn't say the far left but the central laughed a lot of voters who feel they want their country to be open they want their borders to be open they want a dynamic pluralistic society and they are starting to push back against the far right\nSo the woods zoom in a little on on that push back because I'm a support for Merkel drained away to the greens are in Bavaria but also some votes went to the FDA but they're also previously undecided voters or people in twenty Thirteen who didn't vote who wound up supporting both the AFC immigrants so\nToday do the greens on the left have more support than the AFC on the road\nThe greens are are making us stronger come back and the interesting thing is is the greens were originally themselves a fringe party that grew out of the environmental movement of the late seventies and eighties and\nOnly came into power at the federal level in Berlin and in the Nineteen nineties [noise] so it's been very interesting to see them sort of move into this vacuum\nIf you will in the center that as being left by the collapse of support for the main centrist parties which is Merkel's party and then the Social Democrats\n[noise] so what is the Green Party doing right because they walked away with more than doubled their results in Bavaria than in the last election\n[noise] well the Green Party tend to be very strong in urban centers or you know climate change is a really big concern for a lot of Germans here it has been for many many years and so the Green Party that has been there a key issue a since their existence and I think that has helped them out [noise]\nThe greens have also always banned\nFor the idea of a very multicultural pluralistic society and\nYou know the the history of what the Nazis did in this country what the right is capable of has\nAlways been very strongly in the minds of many Germans and the greens have just been able to capitalize on that idea of we do not ever want to go back to a dominance of the far right we have seen in the past century where that will lead us\nSo just tell us a little bit more about the Green Party like how big are they in how president are they in German politics right now and should we expect to be hearing more about them in the future\nRight now they've been polling as the second strongest party interestingly enough at the national level and that certainly wasn't the case last year and the election they really struggle to get in so I think they've benefitted very much in the past\nYear from the entrance of the AFC into opposition uh ... they don't want to lead the opposition over to the far right and people have rallied around that idea\nMost uh ... what does this all mean for ankle America because after the federal elections last year a winter coalition fail to get a strong majority in parliament a lot of people said this is the end of the road for Merkel at least the beginning of the end of the road so after this regional upset and Bavaria how much further does is take us down toward the end of the road for Merkel\n[noise] well that's really the central question to come out of this election we're going to be looking to the state election it has that which is coming up in two weeks' time where her party holds the governorship and if\nThey are to lose that it could really uh make things difficult for her in December when her party goes to vote for a new leader\nMost Eddie of the New York times correspondent in Berlin thanks very much for your\nTime thank you\nGermany's complex politics make me think of a German artist an artist who's got a

complex musical mind but first I Want you to imagine Don Johnson and pastel Armani watching the waves roll into Biscayne Bay yeah this is ... take on the music on Hummer road for the classic Nineteen eighties cop show Miami Vice\n[noise]\nWell gentlemen and things to pound\nGerman men playing steel pan in Hamburg and I gotta say environmentally musically hamburgers not really the kind of place where you'd find much reason to hear steel pen music or any reference to Miami Vice so when it comes to a cover of the Miami Vice on steel and my question simply is\nWhy I ... I can tell you I mean I'm I'm a kid of the uh the eighties and that fame just stuck on what's play that techno pop\nOr cost me ... over here in Europe so it's actually part of a dance track over here and that just didn't get it off my head [noise]\nCovering old funk and so in hip hop is kind of the currency of a book how rhythm and steal band or I Know you lived in Trinidad for a while so that must have been pretty influential on your music when was that in why were you there\nUh totally yeah that was a long time ago that was I think right after September eleventh I was in my early twenties twenty five at the time I had a friend who was already on the with the steel town movement and the bill's main instrument and he showed me the first steps [noise]\nTell me about the cover of the Lenny Hitler tune 'cause that takes us right into the Caribbean doesn't it [noise] yeah it does provide before it's probably closest to a ... I'm a I just played in a ... and the not so much at all that's left some that just is\n\nSo what is it like to tour with a book out with them and feel bad I mean is it a is it hard to do the uh the loaded with the steel pan drums\nUm we don't to a project for several reasons one of\nThe load and maybe and um the other is that um we do a lot of over ... because we have three instruments and maybe three players don't they also play over and spent like to play guitar that's the sex is one of those who plays\nOn the record on them so we have done a couple of shows just specials like TV you saw a wall so [noise] but we don't want to do a ... or ...

GBH here in Boston long before he became president Donald Trump wrote in a tweet in which he called climate change a hoax now in an interview with sixty minutes he's reversed himself\nPresident Trump told the CBS program yesterday that he does not believe climate change is a hoax but he also said he's not sure if climate change is manmade\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but it I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nSo the president told sixty minutes we're going to fact check some of what he said and for that I'm joined by the world's invite\nAnd a reporter Carolyn Beeler Carolyn hey markup [noise] so let's start with this moment\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again\nHeroine will the climate change back again\nSo Trump there seems to be talking about the natural cycle of earth warming and cooling um this has happened in the past that's why we've had ice ages and glacial retreat\nBut humans in the past century or so have pumped so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that we are now literally off the charts when we look at the natural variation and we're not going to go back to the way it was anytime that's relevant on a human timescale\nAll right here's another Trump statement\nI don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade\nOr we know there is a strong scientific consensus that climate change is in fact Mamet wrote\nThere is even among Trump's own scientific and see if this is what a NASA website has to say I'm quoting here the current warming trend is a particular significance because most of it is extremely likely to be the result of human activity since the twentieth century\nRight greater than Ninety five percent likelihood of by the way and finally this argument from Trump about acting on climate change costing us lots of money\nI Will say this um I don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nRight and that's a common argument from politicians pivoting away from fossil fuels would cost a lot through or false\nWell there are a couple of different ways that people poke some big holes in this argument the first is looking at the cost of changing our economy versus the cost of inaction\nAnd many studies have shown that there will be a significant drop in global GDP if we don't do anything to combat climate change because of a loss of productivity increased storm damage et cetera\nAnd that is true specifically for the U.S as well as globally another thing to look at is jobs it's true that with any structural shift in the economy there will be winners and losers think about folks who lost their jobs in factory that automation has risen\nBut there's also the argument to be made that there are a lot of job opportunities that come with shifting toward a green economy and right now there are about two and a half times the number of people working in the solar industry here in the U. S. as there are in the coal industry\nGrowth Carolyn Beeler ... you're all come into\nThe Arctic is feeling the effects of climate change faster than anywhere else we're going to be looking at those changes and the people living through them we'll get help from our partners at the threshold podcast host Amy Martin will be sharing tales from her travels in that region over the last\nYear there was a very basic question what is the Arctic or more specifically what's the Arctic Circle Amy found out that the answer is not so simple [noise]\nI'm On the island of ... of the northern coast of Iceland standing in front of a huge concrete ball it's nine feet in diameter and it has a great pockmarked sort of lunar looking service and a big hole in the center that the wind is blowing through\nI'm standing on the Arctic Circle my voice sounds really strange right now because I Am logging into an enormous wall rain\nThis fear is wonderfully weird it feels like I might have found a stone flung from the slingshot mythological Nordic giant it's called orbits and global that's Latin for circling sphere it was placed here to mark this line we've drawn around the top of the world called the Arctic Circle\nSo it helps to answer one fundamental question what is the Arctic there's a seemingly simple answer everything north of here but there's a twist we put this line on our maps in Globes as a fixed permanent thing but the sculpture was designed to move\nWhy is there a giant mold resulted in circles and why this huge soldier every year to stay on the Arctic Circle [noise]\nOne of the most fascinating things about the Arctic is the way it's scrambles our relationship with light\nIf you're north of the Arctic Circle in the summer solstice the sun never sets on the winter solstice it doesn't come up at all this is why the Arctic Circle is where it is it's supposed to mark this region where there's twenty four hours of light for at least one day each summer and twenty four hours of darkness for at least one day each winter\nAll across the Arctic their signs marking this line little spots for tourists to get their pictures taken maybe buy souvenirs\nAnd that's the way it's always been on the island to until these two guys got involved\nAnd I'm Steve Chrysler and I'm an architect\nBut I'm ... and ...\nHow did you see lessening corruption UC [laughter]\nChristian and Steve both live in Reykjavik Iceland capital in twenty Thirteen they heard about a competition to make a public art piece marking the Arctic Circle and ... and as Christian looked into it he got intrigued by one small detail about the project\n... a crush on a smaller number is is that the the Arctic Circle is moving forward to ... meters a year and the phone was rather strange ...\nHis research led him to the third character in this story ... ... ... is an astronomer he's retired now but he used to work at the University of Iceland\nMm are treated much pressure to use the effect of sun on youth\nAnd he told them it was true Arctic Circle is moving and that's because the axis of the earth is moving slowly racking up and down between twenty two and twenty four and a half degrees or seen says this movement happens in a predictable cycle\n... for two thousand years twenty thousand years and one grocery and twenty thousand years back\nIt's called ... and it changes the amount of the planet that goes into total darkness and total daylight every year when the earth's axis gets closer to straight up and down the Arctic Circle shrinks when it gets more tilted the circle spread out\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down\nSo the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away grants he is currently the only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle and not drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you ride the plane as soon as the sign the maid of honor minimum thoughts with all of the ... the urban that go walk around the sign gives them a certificate and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores teen told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touched currency for a few more decades", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Austin", "day": "15"}
