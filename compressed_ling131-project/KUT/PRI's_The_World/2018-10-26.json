should private companies be entering into lucrative contracts with the federal government that help the Trump Administration build tools for use in areas like immigration and defense that debate is alive and well at Amazon\nThis week the Daily Beast report is that the company is trying to woo ice immigration and Customs Enforcement into using Amazon's controversial facial recognition technology\nAndrew Peterson is with the nonprofit project on government oversight and co reported the story she told us emails she obtained show Amazon and I started discussing this over the summer\nThough it's not clear if and when this facial recognition software would be deployed by the agency I asked Peterson what we know about how that would work\nSo basically facial recognition technology is when you have an algorithm set up that can match pictures with other pictures in a really automated super fast speeds up much faster than like if you were looking at a picture and I'm like oh yeah that matches that one that much is that one these are the same person\nAnd what's concerning to civil liberties advocates and even some former ice officials is that Amazon is\nPromoting a technology that's capable of doing that but using it in real time so real time facial recognition which means they could set up like a video camera across the crowd and scan it as people go past and say oh it's the front of the people that were looking\nFor [noise] so so do we know that ice has used facial recognition technology in that manner we don't know that\nAt this point and we are actively investigating to try and find out more about how the agency interested in using this kind of technology but at this point they've been very tight lipped\nNow you mentioned immigrant rights and privacy advocates are worried about ice using this technology ah why immigrant\nRights groups and civil liberties advocates are worried about ice using this technology for a number of reasons and I do want to say it's not just limited to those groups in fact for our story we spoke to a number of former ice officials\nIncluding Alonzo Kenya a former deputy director at the agency who expressed real concern that what the agency would end up doing with this kind of technology if they acquired it\nWas setting up cameras as sensitive locations like churches or hospitals or schools and then using those two almost randomly search people trying to access those vital services\nI understand there's also a concern about this technology giving false positives what's that about so false positive is when\nA recognition system looks at two images and says yeah these are the same people but they're not actually the same people\nAnd facial recognition technology to date has had a lot of problems particularly when they're trying to match for people of color which has and potentially you pretty scary consequences if you consider this kind of technology being rolled out and for instance an immigration or law enforcement and\nA situation have Amazon employees raised issues about you know their company being part of something like this\nYes and that's one of the really interesting things about who to Amazon's continued interest in working with ice is that Amazon employees actually publicly came out with a letter saying hey we are very uncomfortable with recognition being sold to local police department\nWe know from the emails we received that over a month later ice continue their discussion with recognition\nIs there anywhere in the U.S is using Amazon's a recognition there which is the name of their facial recognition software so yes\nThe ACLU earlier this year reported that a number of local police agencies had been using recognition on sort of a trial basis so this is technology that's already starting to be ruled out in the field and unfortunately this point\nWe don't have as much information as we would like about how to be used or what the implications of it are going to be for fairness of enforcement\nAndrew Peterson is with the nonprofit project on government oversight thanks Andrea thanks so much for having me oh\nVoters in the republic of Ireland went to the polls today they were there to select a president a largely ceremonial post in Ireland\nAnd they voted in a referendum on a proposal to amend the country's constitution Patsy McGarry religious

me\nWell that's very difficult thing to do is never be property to find an Irish law and read it in her from the uh Victorian\nWestminster ... it was banned by common law in Ireland when we were

Methodist minister priest apologizing in ... I was there so distraught and thrown out of court\nOr the law says selection and are actually on ... grounds was in Seventeen hundred and five wow ... material minister was J because he said she just wasn't designed for you to find a lot of money back\nThat yeah no I understand there was some case involving Stephen Fry the British comedian and I guess he got in a little trouble after we made some comments like these an Irish TV\nWhy should I respect it pushes me mine did stupid guard who creates world which is so full of injustice paid\nI understand a citizen filed a complaint about that program right yeah\n...\nC I who doesn't believe in God ... started really angry because leaving on that program\nAnd it was just two years later but for those ... on the ground swimming against that program and our police about looking for ... I was raised by it to stay in the allegation other charge they couldn't find anybody and ran into the sides nothing else\nAnd what's interesting about this is that the citizen actually contacted Stephen Fry directly\nHeated offered us she only got that's the only reason he made the complaint was the show an asinine ... me off and see what his trial like this until I received into a piece of no [laughter] no effect\nHas there been much pushback you know anybody want to preserve the blast make laws\nThere's very little I mean all our church [noise] a commotion in state and in recent days saying do languages saying describing it is largely ups and downs and I've been some shoe predicted with ... said no no we should preserve the dust and the law but it was very very convincing case some people say that\nIt may mean that a religion is cooked come under attack from all sorts of sons but they are protected any how to type into in this country in the constitution so that really just died and the belief is that the referendum today Wendy success so that's the bullet like a ... to remove division ...\nPatsy McGarry religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times thanks a lot in common Brazilians here in the U.

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston no question with the big story of the day is today the arrest of a Florida Man in connection with those explosive devices that were mailed to prominent Democrats and CNN this week\nOne thing the intended recipient have in common they were all critical in some way of President Trump and it's all been on the receiving end effects inflammatory remarks by the president\nToday at the White House though a different message from Trump he said he's committed to do everything in his power as president to stop political violence from taking root in America\nAdam line is that Americans must unify and we my show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens\nTrump's call for unity today seems to contradict a lot of what he says I'm at political rallies and on Twitter he often uses of platforms to attack his opponents and the media\nThat's part of what makes this midterm election season seem especially tense and divisive even by twenty sixteen standards and comments like this one by the president at one recent rally just adds fuel to the fire\nYou know it's sort of became a nationalist\nReally we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist so\nTo find out how all this sounds from outside the U. S. so we reached out to a couple of observers first up Jefferson chase a reporter for ... in Berlin Germany\nJefferson the word nationalist has a history here uh most recently as as one half of the phrase white nationalist and of course it's also an extremely loaded word in Germany how Trump's both that he's a nationalist go down in Germany\n[noise] I mean most of the things that Trump a says and does don't go down very well in Germany to be quite honest them it might be of interest to American audience to know that when I talk to people from our own\nFar right populist party the AFC the alternative for Germany even they don't like using the word nationalist\nOr nationalist than to describe themselves\nAnd of course in Germany the word nationalist\nIs just inexorably associate with Nazis which was the nationalist socialist party of Germany um we're also joined by Cristo cynical lead us he writes for the Greek news site project on he's speaking to us from Athens Christos ... how to Greeks react when they hear the president and the United states use the term nationalist\n[noise] let's go to the beginning when he was ... to whatever he said when Don rather badly in Greece and everybody was saying the ... what what is he talking about how can the president from the United states of America speak like that\nI'm now there are quite a few people who are beginning to speak openly in favor of him and these people come not only from the Golden Dawn ... which is our uh extreme right wing of the um it's many people called a neo Nazi ...\nNow and they were repeating all these last days that Donald Trump was actually copying them because they kind of want to change the label which was a neo Nazi buggy and they called themselves in national politics and when they heard Donald Trump\nCalling himself a nationalist will make come out openly and they say you see or even the strongest president in the world currently is calling himself a nationalist\nSo it sounds like from both of you when President Trump uses the term nationalist ... there's residents in both of your country's in terms of the far right parties except obviously Jefferson you mentioned in Germany that even the far right party there just does not use the term nationalist\nBut Christos I Want to go to you and for this next topic which is the big story this week here in the U.S\nThe explosive devices being sent to a prominent Democrats and ... and long with CNN and authorities have someone now in custody who they believe might be behind these bombings but I I don't know how you've been writing about this big us story what's your take on it\nI think in in what we call here in in in our cars are the more intellectual side of the press and the more democratic than them were pro European they seem to agree that uh these parcel bombs have ended up where they have\nJust by luck all the articles seemed to agree that this was ... by the rhetoric of President Trump or the way that he has been dealing with the press or he doesn't have\nA almost any respect the cool he believes as we used in ... and the British that uh\nIf you disagree with him on anything you all immediately branded as a personal and\nThen me I'm a I must say give them some of the press is actually ... have actually hired a ... a psychologist to whenever Donald Trump says something that actually analyze him in the psychological weight\n[noise] Christmas I Know a grease experienced its own parcel bomb episode what happened there\nWas a few years ago on those possible bombs were sent by a a\nTerrorist group here in in Greece which took responsibility for these specific actions\nI mean they came out very openly and they said we regard this person as being an enemy of the a left wing revolutionary struggle and therefore we have targeted him but what I've read in the ... the day in\nAfrica they draw no power over the line\nBetween this story but we have the British and the one that is still developing a mistake\nJefferson I Want to come back to you for this final issue which is about ... phones and eavesdropping something that a German Chancellor Angela Merkel experienced herself\nThe news this week is that China and Russia has been routinely eavesdropping on President Trump's phone conversations what are the parallels with what happened to the ongoing Merkel\nThere certainly are some parallels\nI mean what sort of different about the reporting is that uh with ... it was almost like how\nCould are good friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to people off the record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff goes on all the time we know that old major countries eased drop and spy on one another but they shouldn't\nBe doing in such open crass ways that seems to have gotten a bit last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing\nThat he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat and save the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Kristof described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension that's generating a lot more passionate about what he\nThen the salt that someone's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and journalists from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over a ... and that kind of thing I mean how ... how are your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think it's a love affair slowly
