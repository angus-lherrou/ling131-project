MIT is more or less thing which really\nDug really deeply into this sort of inconsistency between\nThe methods that a a university like Harvard MIT leads with of being a sort of ethical leader in society why our relationship with Saudi Arabia so problematic I think relationships with Saudi Arabia and universities are problematic and the way that I think and my relationship with rape beyond the weapons manufacturers as problematic and and to be clear\nRelationships like this are not new they've been they've been going on for for a long time I think that when an institution of higher education take the perspective that they are values based organization that they have an ethical mandate to sort of lead\nSociety in a particular way building into that opaque partnerships that you know may extend to believe the unrestricted quote unquote but you know in all reality uh do come with strings attached I I just think that there's a there's a an inconsistency between the sort of ethical language at the university is using and how they're doing business\nSo the the opinion piece you were talking about that you wrote that was in the guardian correct what kind of reaction did you get\nWe did not get their response we would've liked from Harvard MIT a despite our efforts to get this in front of\nOf leadership um you know there wasn't any public response I Believe president rice didn't make a a response to the MIT students or editorial letter but that was sort of along the lines of well we have relationships with everyone and some Saudi PHD students got to come and isn't that great\nAnd of course it's great that sounded pitched it students can come to MIT but to me that's sort of Mississippi the bigger issue\nSo you are also part of a group of people who urged the Cambridge city council to pass a resolution expressing a its opposition to the policies of the crown prince a you even testified why was it important to go to the community around at MIT and Harvard\nIt's important to recognize that when\nOur city is it's really been used in a particular way and that's what this relationship with mom and been salon felt like I felt like the ... the city of Cambridge the institutions in Cambridge where all the uses a basically as one giant photo op to\nContinue to legitimize the you know the power that mom and then someone was gaining that help legitimize and turn things like the war in Yemen um I felt like as a citizen I had a duty to participate in and I was very proud of one of my um city council members Clinton's on driven for putting forward a very bold\nA policy order which which basically went on record\nNot only against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and they're and they're a record and in Yemen and that sort of very spotty progressive or liberal allies in quote unquote that might have been someone has has undergone but also turning it to the University of Harvard and MIT and and basically saying\nYou know we are not a playground for you to be having these very opaque a backdoor relationship\nWhat do you think this MIT review shouldn't tell like what would satisfy you\nAt the very least I Would like to see some public acknowledgement that they were voices who were speaking out against this before the ... before the show the assassination and that's not to\nTo necessarily validate you know a Clinton thunder oven or a yard in and myself\nBut to recognize that the signs were there before this this this assassination and an MIT chose not to look at them and that in terms of the legitimate station that's happening with my ... these are just very different avenues that he can use to pursue the same the same goals and I think some sort of recognition that\nAh you know when you're dealing with a country like Saudi Arabia\nAnd all the relationship ultimately go back to the same place I think that needs to be recognized and understood because I think when you do that it's been a little harder to sort of justify each little relationship is being innocent\nWell we've reached out to MIT and Harvard for their responses to their partnerships with Saudi Arabia but have yet to hear back ...
