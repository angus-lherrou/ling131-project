{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Um before before I reached out um before I maybe was ready for it but I liked it meant a lot to me that she tried that she cared that she remembered\nUm and so again I Can't I Can't speak for anybody else who's adopted but um you know especially if you are really willing to take it at the other person's pace respect where they are and if you're OK with waiting if they want to wait for more or okay what's going slow if they want to go slow I'm\nYou know I I think I think it can be I think it can be handled really sensitive Lee and really carefully and um it might it might be a comfort you know a that was to me it just to know that you're thinking about them um but obviously everybody's different so I Can't say for sure\nIn hindsight you have empathy for why your birth parents made the decision not to really ah reestablish ties with your excuse me are adopted parents made the decision not to um a stylish ties again with your birth parents I I Wonder if she felt that way in the moment though or if it\nFelt like a like a betrayal I really\nDid feel very upset at the fact that my birth mother had reached out had written a letter and then I wasn't told about it for a very long time um my adoptive parents also didn't hang on to the letter so there was nothing even physical for me to hold onto or look at\n'em and I remember asking well did you did you did she signed her name did you get her name 'cause I grew up not knowing her name and they said\nYou know if she signed that we can't remember which to me it just seemed like a very strange answer you know like your child birth mother writes to you and you don't like remember the name I don't know but they they really didn't they didn't have it they we didn't there wasn't much to discuss because they didn't remember claims they didn't remember a lot about it\nUm and I did I did feel I'm Upset and\nI have the trade is the right word I just wish I'd known and I felt I remember feeling very bad for my birth mother at that point like\nIt must have been difficult for her to reach out and then to just be turned away I remember feeling a lot of sympathy but it was too late for me to do anything about it um I I remember being convinced you know with like the righteousness of a teenager\nThat I Would have handled it much better [laughter] but I don't I don't know it wasn't me in that position so I I don't know it was it was definitely it was upsetting at the time for sure\nThis is think I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right let's go back to the phones we have not calling now from Austin Hi Matt\nHi um\nI'm actually would ruin your tree listening to everything um originally connected with my biological father in law they'll remember he's from Paraguay and you actually go out of trouble and gum and as we connected\nIt was the how except in the woods and and\nThe knowledge and everything and I'm always knowing that I was a dolphin people ask me this question that I wanted to you and I'm sure the show is um have you ever considered adoption of a thing that we're pursuing your own life for your own family\nNext recall um thank you for sharing that I have considered it I um my husband and I have talked about it before I think that\nI think we both really like to foster V. foster parents um whether that's temporary or whether it led to adopt and one day it's something we talk about a lot um so yeah it is it is something that I've considered and would consider in the future\nDo your ah your kids look like you\nI'm yes [laughter]\nYes I think they do mhm I Wonder if you I mean I think a lot of biological parents sort of delight in the resemblance of they have 'em to them and their spouse but I Wonder if you feel like it's it's something that mattered more to you based on not having looked like anyone in the family you grew up and\nYeah I mean I Can't compare being adopted to not being adopted and then becoming a parent but I Do remember right after my daughter was born just like looking at her and ... and she has my nose\nYou know a her eyes or brown like mine her came in darker like she heard our skin tones almost exactly the same just things like that I Would notice um and still do like the shape of our faces it's they're they're very similar um and I look a lot like ... both my kids with a lot like me and very different ways\nUm and certainly that meant a lot just having grown up never seen you know myself and the faces of the people I Love the most\nUm and it was interesting to how like really at the same couple of weeks that I was becoming a parent I was reconnecting with my sister Cindy so seen pictures of her for the first time like as I was becoming a mother\nYou know it was I was seeing like two different versions of myself but like two different biological relatives who are so close to me\nUm and I never had this experience before and here he was having it like ... that that really meant a lot to me\nSo I have to imagine writing the story it's not exactly the combination of everything right because this is still ongoing it's still your life you're still making sense of all this but what was there something about completing a draft of the book that made you feel like\nThere's an aspect of this part of my life that I can at least set aside now it's not the front and center in a way that it has been\nThat's interesting I I really do I felt I felt very satisfied on finishing the draft um I was really I was glad to be able to share it with um with my family you know the different people in my life um I said earlier versions to almost everybody\nUm and that that meant a lot um partly because I didn't want them to be surprised by anything I wanted them to have a chance to help me fact check or correct the record 'em and just give feedback\nBut that was really meaningful talking about it with my adoptive parents in particular I felt like you know we'd already been talking about some of these things we didn't talk about when I was growing up but um and we talked about them while I was reconnecting with my birth family and after that the book also kind of forced to new ways and I think it was overall a very good for us\nAnd good for them to be able to read at length you know what it was like for me what I remember\nUm and just have a chance to really share that as a family um that was really meaningful to me\nUh and I I think it's good to that I wrote the book when I did I don't think I could've written it while everything was happening I don't think I could have written that even just a year or two after reunion I think I really needed the time to think um process and figure out\nHow if and how to tell this story um and what what about it would be like worthwhile hopefully to others um so I I think also the timing of it felt good to me like it felt like now with the right time\n[noise] Nicole ... is editor in chief of catapult magazine former

say the Saudi Government sent a hit squad to kill on this\nTeam showed up at the council a of just before he came in and then rush back to the airport and less\nStumble and another disturbing detail among the team of Saudis there was the head\nForensics pet general security in Riyadh so basically a coroner was there the Graham's suggestion is that this was the guy in charge of cleaning up after they did a number on demolish hoagie\nThe disappearance of a Saudi journalist and what it means for international relations today on the world\n[noise] some of his friends are speaking out his fiance had the judge ... recently wrote an op ed pleading with a White House and Saudi officials to get to the bottom of his disappearance and Turkish officials of course the pointing the finger at the Saudi Government how Saudi Arabia reacting to all of this\nJust denial they're basically trying to hope that this goes away and they're kind of online trolls attacking\nThe journalists who are reporting the story accusing them of anti Saudi bias there were attacking both had teacher changes the fiance as well as other friends of Jamal show who spoke out to the media\nI think the nature of who demolish Okie was his connections to elites in academic the think tank world and journalism make it very difficult for this to go way the way the Saudis with like\nHow are journalists like you and assemble feeling at the moment\nJamal ... if someone I Know it was a source of mine someone that I talked to for a few years now\nYou know I talk to him when he was a strident supporter of the regime I Would call them to get a pro Saudi comment I talked to him when he was in Saudi Arabia under been saw him on and said I'm Sorry I Can't say anything and I talk to him once he left and you know wash his sort of evolution read his columns\nAnd read his commentary spoke to him and so on\nJust on that level I think it's horrible I think it's terrible this is someone I knew someone that I considered a colleague as well as a source so it's devastating that there's something like this could happen\nI think I've some measure of protection from this kind of saying because I'm an American but I you know fuel for the other dissident journalists and activists who are in Turkey the Arab Spring\nProduced a lot of dislocation of many people people were you know spread out across the region and across the world and they you know suffered enough having to say goodbye to their homes and their families\nNow they have to be living in fear that the government that they escape from\nIs going to hunt them down and kill them were kidnapped them with impunity\nReporter ... either and assemble President Trump has invited ... distraught fiance to the White House us secretary of state Mike Pompeo was called on Saudi Arabia to support a thorough investigation of ... case and to be transparent about the results\nMembers of the Trump Administration would seem to be on the same page but to what end\nI think they're unified view is please make this go away quickly it's causing us a lot of\nProblems that's tomorrow Kaufman with us of the Brookings Institution she notes the U.S has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia really since World War two she also says ... disappearance threatens the very personal relationship the White House has established\nWhen these guys do business together they get on the phone with each other or Mohammad been summoned the crown prince of Saudi Arabia cause Jared Kushner his son in law of President Trump directly rather than working through ambassadors are lower level aides\nAnd there's also the constant refrain from President Trump that this is my great friend\nAnd indeed this is a language that he is is with regard to a number of autocrats around the world whether it's Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia a president Abdel Fattah el Sisi in Egypt where president to charity and the Philippines\nWhat would you say that ... relationship translates into\nAt least in recent decades American presidents has then it pains to demonstrate that while we have friendships all around the world\nWe do business with all kinds of government our best friends are most reliable friends are most valued friends our fellow democracies that's been a standard refrain in American foreign policy\nI'm pretty much since the end of World War two and and strengthened since the end of the Cold War and that still language that President Trump has thrown out the window in essence I he's made it clear including in his speech at the U.N General assembly a couple of weeks ago that he's\nReally not concerned about how other governments govern their own societies he just wants to know what's in it for him\nI guess I Want to know what difference it all mixed because I mean the Trump White house has been described as enthusiastically pro Saudi but are there really shades of being\nGross out because it's the world's biggest arms importer and one of the biggest exporter of oil I mean that's a that's a wild combination that you're either in or out where the U.S is in right and we've been in for decades\nThe United states has been happy to have a very close relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia since the end of World War two the last and Saturday worked together to develop those Saudi oil fields and yes the kingdom of Saudi Arabia purchases quite a lot\nOf weaponry from the United states President Obama in fact sold a record dollar amount of weapons to the kingdom during his eight years in office and Trump looks\nThat record 'em so there is continuity but there is a substantive difference in the Trump administration's approach in that\nPresident Trump has really signal that he's willing to give the Saudis have free hand not just in terms of repression at home but in terms of regional policy as well under Trump the Saudis basically have a blank check\n[noise] so what are you seeing as reaction from the White House right now about what could well be an assassination of this journalist or ...\nLook a lot of this information that seems to be leaking out of turkey is still unconfirmed and as someone who knows Jim all I have to hope that this is not true but there are increasing a indications that what we're looking at here is a very brazen\nAssassination of a journalist on foreign soil\nThat's shocking not because autocrats don't try to shut down their critics\nBut it sprays and because it appears to have been a planned murder if the report information is accurate and it's brazen also because ... is someone who is well known both in Saudi Arabia and in the west and\nRoosevelt of the state of Virginia\nYes and he's been living in Virginia and writing in the Washington Post and I think that the swift and fears outrage among all these other sectors in Washington pushed the White House into a response where we might not otherwise have seen one\nThis is notable because it's the first public criticism that we've seen from the Trump Administration at any senior level of Saudi human rights behavior\n[noise] how much did U.S intelligence know about cause she'll be safety before he walked into this consulate in Istanbul\nThis is a very important question and one to which I don't think we have a complete answer the Washington Post reported last night\nThat uh sources were telling them that U.S intelligence intercepted communications uh among Saudi officials talking about their desire to lure them all back to place where they could get their hands on him [noise]\nThat's very disturbing if true because it raises the immediate question of when\nThe intelligence community and learn this information and what if anything the U.S government did to warn a resident of the United states about the fact that a foreign government was plotting against his safety\nAgain if it turns out the Saudi officials plant and executed this assassination what's going to mean to other allies like in Saudi Arabia get away with this on the world stage\nIf the United states is not willing to stand up against the violations\nOf basic human rights if the United states is not willing to stand up for a a journalist who was merely exercising his right to free expression\nThen other governments that also believe in these rights also think they are important but have less power less influence flexibility to insulate themselves from the blowback\nWill be deterred from speaking up themselves and moreover those vulnerable people who most need the protection of international human rights lot dissidents journalist a civil society activists\nThey take on the risk of doing their work\nIn the face that democratic governments around the world will speak up for them if they are arrested or disappeared for exercising their rights and so it's a betrayal of those people around the world when the United states fails to play that role\n...\nCome from and give me the biz dot com where vehicle owners container purchase

Rios and this is what he told me\nI could make this base impervious to rush I'm an engineer and I believe it all things or do but this base is not an Iowa and\nThis is not an island meeting people have to get to it from somewhere and already I Norfolk there are days when the main road going into the base floods and people can't get to work which means they can't resupply ships that are docked there so this is already seen at the military readiness issue\nThe military has long been considered a one of the most proactive parts of the federal government when it comes to planet for climate change I mean the Pentagon very clearly a number of years ago called climate change a threat multiplier is that still the case are they still proactive\nI Would say yes and no one I was standing on up here with pat Rios at Norfolk naval base he said you know it's not my job to ask why sea levels are rising right now it's my job to know what the projections are and plan for them um so this is sort of still the attitude of the military so even today secretary of defense Jim Mattis\nHas said that climate change is a national security issue and we do need to plan for it\nYeah I mean planning a suggest the military has a really different attitudes or from the White House on on climate change what does that actually mean though on the ground\nSo there are directed being given an instruction being given to the military and the Pentagon to plan for climate change so for example the navy right now is required to plan for a sea level rise and all of its forward planning and Congress recently directed the Pentagon to identify the top ten sites\nThreatened by climate change but these directed and is planning doesn't always translate to action or money allocated in terms of preparations for climate change\nToday I talked to David Titley who retired rear admiral who actually headed to the U.S Navy's task force on climate change for a while and this is what he told me about the military's preparations\nSince I'm now in state and I have to a certain grade students I Would give the military is he might or its preparations they have done some initial or\nThey have pulled out the over arching documents say what are going to do but at the end of the day funding these type of infrastructure improvements\nIs very very hard\nTo lead did point out one tidbit of forward momentum on the funding aspect here which is that Congress authorized military spending to prepare for climate change in outside of the fence applications so if we go back to naval station Norfolk\nThe problems with people getting to work on that naval station have to do not with a military site but with infrastructure outside of the military base so there's been some funding authorized for helping military readiness when it occurs off of military bases so I think this is an example of how\nWhat's happening with Congress regarding climate change specifically on military readiness as a little bit different than the rhetoric that's coming out of the White House\nWell for the good people along the Gulf Coast we wish them an a plus for dealing with the effects of Michael the world Carolyn Beeler thanks very much You're welcome Marco\nHurricane Michael comes in the wake of two related events this week the un climate report that I mentioned earlier which urge much quicker action to avert serious climate change consequences also a Nobel Prize in economics go into Paul Romer who's focused in part on how innovation can help us tackle the climate crisis\nNew approaches and technology can definitely help but it also pays to look back to the way things used to be done\nThat is what's happening in some remote parts of Australia a changing climate and damaging farm practices have degraded a lot of land there now the Australian government is hired a group of people with deep ties to the land to rethink the way it's managed and practiced and protected\nYou might say their consultants who knows the land best aboriginal people using traditional techniques handed down over centuries here's reporter deeper Fernandez\nIt's a one morning in the remote community peach tree\nI mean a jeep with a group of aboriginal women on that whole range it on line by\nWomen from the local community Hispanic days tremendous thing a large swath of land and ti tree and doing general land maintenance on these ranges different and how they do that job she got a degree in land management\nThey studied textbooks to learn land protection techniques\nThey stopped the week like consulting with The Elders the traditional bonus at the land it's a name for the indigenous people who've lived here", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "10"}
