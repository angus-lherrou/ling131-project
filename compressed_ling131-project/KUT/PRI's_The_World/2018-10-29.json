we've seen sort of exploiting the year so it's a valid way of thinking and lots of native people think that way but there's a corny version of it but like the only way to and it's sort of\nDismissive version of it what is it mostly in relation to urban Indians it's like if you aren't on the land\nUm then you're not really Indian um\nAnd this is also has to do with with relating to Oakland as environment and as land also um\nIt's filled with with concrete and metal and clash and wires but um it's still the land I mean the alone if people were the tribe that would have lived here for many years ago and I I Know many people who live in Oakland now\n[noise] um\nYou mentioned earlier the what are you question which I just can't imagine that can be asked in a way that is not really offensive but do you ever just pretend you don't understand what people mean when they ask you that\n[noise] um\nNo I you know but like I was saying earlier I always know that have something offenses offensive is coming after I say that I'm native\nI'm like Ninety percent of the time the response to me saying I'm native tends to be offensive um in various different ways like deliberately offensive not always but it offensive questions that are out of ignorance so it becomes sort of an\nEducational opportunity if if I'm feeling especially positive that day or um\nIt just always becomes a thing or I you know or a shutdown and I walk away or you know it's different responses overtime\n[noise] my guest is novelist Tommy orange we're talking about his a critically acclaimed book it's called ... novel if you'd like to join the conversation you can call eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you you're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd\n\nDid your father tried to prepare you for this stupid things people say Q A kid who looks Native American\n[noise] no [noise] um [noise] he really didn't you very much um wanted us to feel pride in being native and to know who we come from there was that was never not a thing [noise] um\nAnd\nI'm just recently actually I was telling him so I got back my\nAttractive from the novel was in the New Yorker and um that got fact checked by the New Yorker and which is kind of a weird fact checked fiction in my case I think they\nThey maybe we're wondering what were the autobiographical elements in that particular chapter happens to closely resembling experience and family I reference the family that I'm referencing and that tractor is mine and my family knows that and they've read it and [noise] um\nSo they got a hold of somebody because I've referred to my dad um being on a reservation in Oklahoma and it's not technically reservations their tribal jurisdiction land um that's not\nSort of like a\nTo say reservations is shorthand people understand what you're talking about and my dad's even refer to himself growing up on the reservation even though it's not the reservation the conditions are very similar and it's you\nKnow it's a land base where lots of shy and people are but when\nThey're factoring they got a hold of a university professor at um Oklahoma University I'm not sure which one and uh the fact you're told me that this woman Native American studies person but he talked to said I don't think this author is met a single Native American person in their life\nI'm slowly because I said reservations about Oklahoma even though there's no reason no technical reservations now um so I told my dad died and he got um he he wanted me to find out who they were like he was going to go after them\nSo [laughter] um because he's protective of him yeah yeah\nI was the first I mean I was the first time you've ever done that before um expressed that kind of\nA sentiment there was a national what is your family excited for this book to come out [noise] [noise] yeah\nThey're they've been a incredible and um when I've talked to them about doing this autobiographical and um they're all really into it they\nThey um they don't mind me I mean I'm gonna fictionalized ... divert in ways that didn't happen that's what I like about fiction um but they're happy for her story to be out there was a hard earned one I'm so\nSort of like we should do something with it [laughter] [noise] um\nI don't want to talk specifically about the ending of the novel um\nBut I Wonder if you've heard from people who have expressed surprise frustration um satisfaction with the way the very dramatic way the story in\nYeah I've I mean I've heard a range of different reactions I think interestingly the native reaction I'm\nAs it's been very positive from Oakland natives to NATO's all over the country um I think people are just seeing themselves reflected in literature and in a way that maybe they haven't read before um but the white reactions especially to the ending um as you sort of like\nDisappointment in like what is it have to be so sad um\nSo it's interesting that make you want to strangle somebody it\nI Try to explain it um that you know\nThese are real elements from people's lives that happened and to dismiss it as just sad is um it's it's just reductive and and not very intelligent and smart reflection of your own emotional maturity or something if that's all you got from it was that it was sad I prefer maybe tragic\nHas a grander scope to it um so it's definitely frustrating because a lot of my by graphical um details or in the characters so it's like calling me sad which is a super sad thing to hear from someone [noise]\nUm do you feel like I I mean I have to imagine that there have been Native Americans who have been writing for a very long time now in telling their stories and sharing their stories but um but maybe the sort of brought her publishing industry wasn't that interested in in giving these books that place\nYeah there's been a these waves so I'm after the civil rights movement in the occupation of Alcatraz there was a wave of um what they called at the time the Native American renaissance\nAnd um then that died down and the less books were coming out and you can sort of see this over time and then in the nineties I think because of dances with wolves there was another research and there's one happening now which sort of\nCoincided with um what happened at Standing Rock and I think you know when it comes into the public consciousness people are interested in I just hope that it's not a wave but something that you know continues to be paid attention to and listened to\nNew book by novelist Tommy orange is their their

we did and and are finding it here in the u._s. safety and health and at a chance at a future\nAlso Chinese dissident artists I way way if you're on the U.S right now so what's his take on the current mood\nThat reality is about how are you as a nation to have full power to accept the difference and a half of the big heart\nI went away and much more today you're on the world\nSanctuary here where they can worship where they can express their beliefs where they can associate with the people that they want you so for them this is a sanctuary and I don't think it's really changes that\nBut of course everybody's worried about where to go\nWith the rhetoric from the president and the reception as some of his tweets are getting with people like the alleged attacker in Pittsburgh as well as the alleged bomb maker last week where do you sit in the middle of all this rhetoric and how do you deal with it\nBut I think the only way that we the only thing is to stand up to it I think that we learn a time and time again and particularly this weekend is that he speech can lead to hate action and violence and we can't give it a path anymore that's really are only weapon we need to stand up and fight against hate and make sure we don't\nDo any of it a pass anymore because they think consequences can be so tragic\nMelanie does or the senior vice president for public affairs of highest thank you very much for your time today really appreciate it thank you very much\nWill Carl is covers extremism for reveal from the center for investigative reporting he's based in Brazil where there is another big story today the election of far right candidate ... as president more on that later\nFor science will how the Pittsburgh synagogue attack fits in with his reporting on extremism in America\nObviously it's a particularly violent episode I mean we do see\nAnti Semitism really ramping up over the last couple of years really you know following the election of president Donald from you see all ... of anti Semitism on social media or on on right wing social media but also a mainstream social media like Facebook and Twitter\nAnd so you know it's not particularly surprising I mean this isn't the first guy to walk into a cynical or a Jewish center as the shooting people and sadly I Do think that he'll be the last but the scale of this attack was worse than anything we've seen at least in recent years\n[noise] I I Know it can be difficult to connect violence to political rhetoric but looking at events like the mail bombs last week in the synagogue shooting to what extent can you make that link because we've got to remember Dylann Roof went into a Charleston South Carolina church and killed people there before the election of Trump\nYeah I you know I don't find it difficult to make that link at all I mean you've got president Donald Trump re tweeting and spreading\nCompletely full anti Semitic theories about George Soros the Hungarian Jewish multi billionaire say he's you know funding everything from the caravan of migrants who's making their way to the southern border to protesters and you know that trickles down that trickles down we see\nFor example the Pittsburgh she took on his gab social media accounts\nIn the days leading up to the shooting was posting about George Soros\nOf Trump mega fun Santa pipe bomb allegedly to George Soros his home so\nI think there are clear connections and I think the media just needs to stop don't sing around this subject and just lay it out very clearly the president is spreading malicious rumors and that is trickling down to his fan base and people are going out and killing people it's as simple as that\n[noise] so you mentioned the social media site gab and we've heard a lot about it since the shooting in Pittsburgh tell us more about what are you know\nThat basically an old right twist to I mean that's the way to think about them now ... is that they're all about free speech and the reality is\nThat it's a collection of neo Nazis racist anti Semite people who like to get on and spread mostly fake known since about Jews about people of color and I mean I think most people would be absolutely the whole by most of the content on there\nI mean they've been shut down but one of the people who go to gab want they just go somewhere else to find a like minded community\n[noise] [noise] yeah this is a tricky debate has been going on for some time though you know to what extent is it\nIf a case just to deep platform these guys to shut down that places of congregation\nBut I mean I kind of think that that misses the point I mean ultimately the people who hosts gab their private company run by individuals like you and me\nBut if they don't want to hurt people who are spreading hateful stuff then that's their prerogative these guys are not being sent said it's not as if a government body or entity is coming in and saying hey you guys can spread your message they'll find someone else to hurt them I think we just have\nTo acknowledge that every time a Republican congressmen you know read tweets a conspiracy theory they make these people feel as if they're legitimate as if they're saying is true and that's something that five years ago didn't really exist you know these people lived on the fringes\nAnd were treated as out cause and today that being legitimize by mainstream politicians and in some cases by the president himself\nWell let's turn to Brazil now I mean you've got an interesting perspective on extremism covered hate us and living in Brazil especially now that there's been this election yesterday but lead to a victory for populous right wing candidate drier both so narrow what parallels do you see between both so narrow and Donald Trump\nI actually think that the power of those have been over blown up because\n... makes Donald Trump looked like Mr Rogers he says openly homophobic things he once said that he would rather his son with dead than gay I mean he's told a female congresswoman on the floor\nOf the national Congress that he didn't think she was with raping because she was basically not attractive enough for him I mean this is a guy who is very open about his hateful speech and he was also we've seen added fuel\nTo the far of racism and ... and and especially antique journalism violence in Brazil over the last few months a Brazilian investigative journalism organization has tracked at least fifty hate\nFew crimes committed by ... and our support is across the country\nThere's such in the political violence connected to ... and our\n[noise] so what is the mood like in Brazil or this day after the election they're\nHonestly the mood is pretty ... I mean especially in the neighborhood that I live in Brazil like America is very divided right now you've got the north\nWest and to some extent the north east of Brazil to sort of more rural areas that really didn't support ...

filed last week against Exxon Mobil alleges they defrauded shareholders by downplaying the climate change threat to its bottom line\nJeff Colgan is a professor at Brown university who specializes in energy and environmental policy what exactly is Exxon Mobil being accused of Jeff well\nThey're specifically being accused of deceiving the investors in that fed to which climate change might hurt the profitability of ... but of course that's related to a larger story about how extra Lobos public relations campaign have to see you\nThe public about climate change\nA Exxon Mobil was instrumental in some of the campaign led by the American Petroleum Institute which is the kind of industry lobby group\nIn the Nineteen Ninety that set out specific goals to try to um get the public to recognize uncertainty to the climate change at a certain issue where there wasn't clarity around the science of it and\nThat was very much inconsistent with what Exxon Mobil own scientists were saying where they are saying look the science settled and we understand the climate changes coming at it caused by humans\nWhat what is the Exxon Mobil been saying in his defense\nWell a ExxonMobil has changed it to go over time\nUh when the c._e._o. with Lee Raymond in two thousand\nHe was very much opposed to the idea of global warming you back even said publicly that he feared a coming ice age more than he feared catastrophic war me so he had a really kind of tough lied on climate change since then\nThings have changed so when Rex Tillerson who later became secretary of state when Tillerson became the c._e._o. the Exxon Mobil changed his tune and they started to\nWithdraw funding from the groups that had been deny the science of climate change that Exxon had been funding in the Nineteen Ninety that early to pass\nPresumably this lawsuit focuses on those earlier days is there a smoking gun like a memo where higher ups of the company said at one point look this is this is our plan\nWell that's interesting because the New York attorney general\nHas been requesting internal documents and we don't know what all those documents say but the deputy attorney general has said exactly those words that you just a smoking gun plural so we don't know what the text about it but it sounds like the prosecutors are\nConfident that ExxonMobil\nDid deceive it's shareholders\nSo Exxon Mobil is all over the globe is this the New York attorney general's office acting alone or have they been hearing from interested parties all over the globe\nThe New York state attorney general is of course very powerful because the New York stock exchange it's governed by New York state law and so other parties have been weighing including other states\nAnd presumably other countries are going to be watching this ...\nJeff Colgan professor at Brown University Thanks very much for your time thank you\nDespite what Exxon might have suggested the big picture science of climate change that's been clear for years carbon dioxide and other kinds of pollution from human activity helped trap more heat in the atmosphere that warms up the planet\nThere is uncertainty though about some of the details things like how all that warming is affecting the natural systems of the earth permit for us for example the freezer of the planet\nAnd you know what it's like when you leave your freezer door open for a

flocks of birds circling around me and this guy and I'm just sitting there like a tourist in climate change research to be so much fun\nSo much fun and the votes\nThat isn't filled a nice out she ... trade off doing rolling their masters students at ... university and they're studying Arctic permafrost soil that's been frozen all year round for at least two years\nThey're measuring the gases that promote press releases when it saw as as it starting to do because these are some of the same gases that helped to warm up to climate you'll ... he's leading this project he's working on his PHD at the same school\nWe're looking at the methane gas bubbling from the leg sediment into the atmosphere\nUsually when we talk about climate warming emissions we're thinking of the stuff coming out of our cars are smokestacks all around the earth day and beautiful places like this powerful greenhouse gases are starting to escape into the atmosphere and they're coming from Thomas sauce [noise]\nThe amount of car windows stored in here is is so it's twice the amount that we have in the atmosphere and so that will be released into the atmosphere that would mean accused climate change for sure\nWhen you say the amount of carbon we have stored here is twice with an answer you mean the amount of carbon we have in the architect\nYeah just in the Arctic for her first just to prove a for for ... yeah wow\nThis is a statistic worth remembering so let me put it in another way take all the carbon currently floating around in the atmosphere and put it in one basket in schools like all of the carbon currently frozen in Arctic from a frost and it would feel two buckets of the same size\nAway from the lake Geisha very his daddy was a long\nProbe so this is a steel rod\nAnd so this gives
