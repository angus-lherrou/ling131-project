you you have to have\n'em\nIf they understand who you're dealing with first of all and secondly you have to recognize that you need the same kind of process of a very specific set of steps that will be taken with a very specific timetable and rolled out as to how those steps are going to be taken\n'em and and um\nI Do think there is a way to get things done with Russia\nUm I I I met with putting at great length and I met ... libre many many times\nAnd we were able to work to compartmentalize even as we were imposing sanctions for Crimea and for what was happening in in eastern Ukraine\nEven as we were pushing them into you know bringing Europe together to impose tough sanctions\nWe were also working with Russia and other things because in in life in diplomacy you have to compartmentalize into dealings with great nations you have to find the places where you can cooperate and then you kind of agree that there are places where you just may not be able to make progress in a certain point in time\nA garbage I did that with the Reagan a Nixon did that with Mao tse tone in China you have differences but you try to work towards things that make the world safer and and certainly that are in your country's interests are countries interest\n[noise] my guest this hour is former U.S secretary of state and five term US Senator John Kerry his new memoir is called every day is extra you're listening to think I'm crystal aid [noise]\nUm since you do travel around the world and good international conferences and and meet with your counterparts and former counterparts I'm I'm curious as to what you can tell us about\nThe way us allies a look at the state of the world today and um and that sort of shift in America has chosen role in the world\nWhat our allies are incredulous as to what is happening right now in deeply concerned about it they feel let down a day are a asking lots of questions because they don't quite know what might happen\nWith NATO or where we're heading with respect to traditional relationships we've had like what do they ask you a specific them well I mean they just say when they ask what's going on where's your president coming from y\nOr Z attacking you know why does he approached these things away\nDoes um ah they they're careful mind you and I'm careful I don't ... you know I Can't I'm not a negotiator now I don't negotiate I don't go into anything\nBut you ask questions you have a conversation you express an opinion and they will tell you that the they're deeply concerned Russia and China are both working overtime to\nChange the global narrative ever since World War two the global narrative\nHas been driven by the United states of America and by the west\nChina has openly articulated through its president at the world Economic Forum and elsewhere that they think that the twenty first century is the Chinese Century\nThey believe liberal order or at least they say whether they believe it or not that the liberal order the west is in decline that the United states is in decline\nAnd when you look at what's happening in Washington you look at the lack of infrastructure investment you look at our budget you look at our inability to make anything important happened in Washington today\nUh it's really hard for people not to believe that we're in trouble right now um our democracy is not working as effectively as it should be period and certainly not working the way it was when I was originally in Washington\nAnd in the Nineteen nineties when we balanced the budget of our country\nA and where we found bipartisanship on and any number of issues that's not happening right now and it's a loss for our country\nYou've been describing you have described yourself as inherently optimistic um I I I'm I'm curious about how you sort of maintain that optimism\nWell I ... the book I mean in the book as optimistic and and it should be because it's a journey its traces this journey of this young son of greatest generation parents uh uh you know kid who grew up\nIn the Cold War and then went off to our own generations war in Vietnam and and then the whole\nMovement of the Nineteen sixties and seventies where we we galvanized around the environment and the women's movement and and and the peace movement and and we elected as an incredible Congress or in Nineteen Seventy four call the Watergate Congress in reaction to the abuses that have taken place\nSo I think we've proved in a difficult time when Medgar Evers was assassinated Martin Luther king assassinated Robert Kennedy assassinated and this was only five years after the President Kennedy was assassinated that's what we grew up\nIn and we made it work we made\nThings happen we created an environmental protection agency we had a clean Air Act passed we safe drinking water act we had a whole new awareness women advanced in ways we never thought title nine changed the face of education for women in our country I mean we made great advances\nWe we we um and I'm optimistic because I've seen what we can do to hold\nWashington accountable to change it ah when when we you know saw Richard Nixon have to resign only a year and a half after read one forty nine states for reelection that was because people made issues voting issues and I and I saw it when we elected President Obama\nWe can do this we can do it now remember when I said fifty four point two percent instead of sixty or Seventy or eighty percent how can we in America\nTalk about the virtues of our democracy and not vote at Seventy or eighty percent or something by the way\nWe're the only country in the world where a political party openly works as hard as it does try to prevent people from voting right here in America\nPassing all kinds of restrictions on people's ability to go to the polls why do we have\nA vote on a on a Tuesday why do we not have\nPaper ballots everywhere and have them available for a week or something we are doing this right and and we got to settle down and get her about the the process of making our democracy fully flourished and I'm confident if we do that we're gonna we're gonna be okay our institutions are stronger\nThan the vagaries of of\nYou know momentary politics and I believe in that and I've also seen what we're doing on the world in the world we're doing great things and and I think we have reason to be

vital services so your family can remain\nTogether in this country those stories today you're on the world\nSo can you tell us how your system is different from the system but failed to work\nThe main difference between our system and those systems is the lack of a bully that's on the surface things that can get vandalized things that can be damaged in heavy seas and additionally our system communicates remotely to the shore the acoustic signals\nYou mentioned vandalism I mean that was a problem with the system failed to work weren't a lot of the ... just stolen\nI don't know the specifics but in the early days of discussing making these new prototype systems that was one of the concerns is that the systems had been vandalized\nYeah so you're prototype is on the sea floor but it's more than a thousand miles from where the silhouettes they nominees struck a and uh the the epicenter of the quake how helpful wouldn't have been on friday\nWell that particular system may not have been helpful but in the larger picture of the program rather than they are just being one censoring on the ocean bottom there would be multiple sensors on the ocean bottom\nA and they could be in very strategic locations around the area and then each one of those if they made a measurement or multiple as if they made a measurement could send that information back to shore acoustic way\nSo there have been at least ten nominees to hit Indonesia the century so far I mean the death toll is up in the thousands what would it take to get your system up and running to be able to alert people throughout the region\n[noise] it's just a matter of time and having the local governments installed the appropriate infrastructure at the moment we're waiting for the next phase of testing to take place over in Indonesia I think in the spring to which the Indonesian government is installing this cable infrastructure\nKeenan ball with the woods Hole Oceanographic institution thanks very much for your time today yeah no problem\nNow to a different subject of scientific research the health of the Amazon rain forest in South America the fate of the forest is intertwined with out of the indigenous people who live there and the animal species in the forest is no exaggeration to say that the Amazon is also tied to the future of the world's climate\nThis week on the world we're going to explain why the Amazon is even more consequential than ever recorded\nSam eaten traveled there recently for us and our partners that the nation magazine and PBS NewsHour Sam joins us now here in our Boston studios so Sam what does the future of the Amazon have to do with the future of the climate yeah Michael often we\nHear of the Amazon for it's incredible biodiversity less often and more so actually you're hearing about the role of the Amazon and the climate a lot of times we'll call their lungs of the planet but actually the metaphor is kind of funny because it's in reverse its absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nThe trees grow as they as photosynthesis happens it absorbs C. O. two sets in men's carbon store\nOf the planet providing this incredible service for us the idea for this series of stories that we're going to be running this week on the world\nCame up about a year ago when science magazine published probably the most important and least noticed climate paper in years scientists from Woods Hole Research Center in Boston University found that tropical forests in the Amazon\nAnd around the world have been so degraded by logging and a burning of the forest and agriculture that they're actually releasing more carbon into the atmosphere\nThan they're storing a this flipping of these carbon sinks to carbon sources has huge implications for the planet Carlos ... is one of the researchers studying this carbon cycle down in the Amazon this is what he had to say\nIf there was that which is the biggest ... stops doing these environmental service off\nSequestering carbon from the actual issue the idea is that you were ... in the atmosphere and sue to will show a great city increments than it has me show you so far\n... what the debt because Saddam mean when he said greater increment\nBasically he's he says that we're going to see higher sea of two concentrations in the atmosphere\nOr the Amazon used to be taking something like all of the emissions from all the cars on the planet\nAnd absorbing it into the forest that's not happening anymore so Sam tell us a where you went in this very large forest in South American who did you talk to you know we're talking about a a forest that's the size of the lower forty eight United States so a massive area and the idea was\nTo go to the what's called the arc of deforestation this is where the agricultural frontier is basically chewing away at the edges of the Amazon and we wanted to talk to as many of the players so you have basically a logging on the front and then you have cattle ranching and then you have these agriculture kind of coming out on the tail end these massive soy farms\nAnd the idea was to talk to his many of these players as possible and piece together all these complex elements that are behind the rising deforestation rates in the Amazon right now so if\nMetaphor is as you said earlier the lungs of the world are no longer inhaling like they use or they're not coughing what is your take from this whole set of stories that we're going to hear\nI mean I think the biggest takeaway from this is is that there's no clear villain um it's not just\nYou know the illegal loggers going and we need to stop the bulldozers it's all of us essentially so if you're eating beef if your eating other meat that has spent ... that comes from the Brazilian Amazon if you're building a deck that has ... which is one of the highest value hardwood coming from the rain forest\nYou know this is affecting the future of the Amazon Forest and this is something that affects all of us because if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement\nIs not going to happen without these for us we actually need to be growing more trees not cutting them down\nYeah and that list you just went down from burgers too hard with like ... from the Amazon will give a lot of Americans pause so are not very encouraging picture and was serious consequences or what hope is there any glimmers\nYeah and this was a big focus of our reporting a there's a lot of energy happening down there I'm Around indigenous entrepreneur is small farmers people that are trying to create a standing forests economy how do you value the forests economically more so than cutting it down as a way to kind of get away this duality of\nConservation on one side and extraction on the other which is a very much you know a losing game assets as it's been another glimmer of hope or the indigenous groups that are protecting their for us and this is one of the best productions they've found scientists documented this hum that indigenous groups who have\nClear land rights entitled to their land this is one of the best protections against the afar station so I spent a lot of time with these indigenous groups that have basically taken you know protecting their forced into their own hands they've organized these vigilante militias that patrol their lands to keep the constant pressure of illegal logging out of their lands\nThey've also taking the fight to Brasilia to protest what's happening politically which is rolling back a lot of these indigenous rights so that you could open up their lands to mining and agriculture and I'm One of the organizers of an event that I was there where it was like three thousand indigenous people from a hundred different groups showed up in Brasilia\nAnd protested they marched I'm Sonja ... is one of the main organizers that she is also a vice presidential candidate and the upcoming election and this is what she had to say\nAbout his engaged in as lay his age they put up ... days each day\nSo she's saying indigenous people have basically been fighting these forces for millennia and she's saying that the fight is for force that benefit not just the indigenous people but all of humanity so this is not just their causes everyone's\nThe lungs of the

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston the United states Canada and Mexico I've come to a last minute agreement to update the north American free trade agreement just don't call it NAFTA to point do call\nUs MCA sort of just work [noise]\nPresident Trump at the White House today\nUs MCA is short for the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nKind of flows off the tongue joining me now in the studios the world's Jason Margolis or could have been a ... you know your abbreviated that to gay or half it could've been top possibly a missed opportunity Jason you've been writing about NAFTA for a long time now how how are people reacting to this new NAFTA the U.S MCA\nWell there's the politics and then there's the economic side of it and the quick political reaction is from President Trump we had the worst deal in the history of that\nWorld and now it's the greatest deal in the history of the world\nThis landmark agreement will send cash in jobs pouring into the United states and into North America good for Canada good from Mexico and set of jobs are leaving for overseas\nThey will be returning back home and we've already had it\nAnd the truth is what was agreed to yesterday it's not a radically different trade agreement from NAFTA it's an updated deal so it's like saying I have a a a baseball team I got rid of a couple of players who was the worst team ever knows the best team ever so when you look at the economics it's not it's not a radical overhaul updates things\nJason when you come right down to what's really different about us MCI from NAFTA\nSo there are some changes to some key industries for example autos are now requires that Seventy five percent of car must be made in North America Kevin with us or Mexico in order to qualify for no tariffs under the new deal the what is it the the us MCI\nDoesn't quite flew off my town yet I'm One of the thing it's got a lot of attention is us dairy farmers will have more access to the Canadian markets\nCanadian dairy farmers are not happy about that or they feel they've been used as a political ... on this is David ... she's the vice president of the dairy farmers of Canada and that's what he had to say\nToday the message sent to are passionate crowd and quality cautious people is clear they're nothing more than a bargaining chip to satisfy President Trump\nYes so Canadian dairy farmers not happy I'm can President Trump counts as accurately as a big political when\nI think so it does bring NAFTA into the twenty first century it addresses intellectual property the age of ... just as a nation I mean this was passed in the early nineties so it does update things but also\nKeep in mind that I spoke with Jason for men who served as President Obama's she from the council of economic advisors he said yeah this is great that we have some certainty and things are moving forward but all these things were negotiated under an updated Trans Pacific partnership and all these things most of these things were updated the sweat from and told me this morning\nA lot of this is getting things back that Canada had already agreed to in another agreement two years ago\nWhat happens now when does this deal become real\nSo the easy part is done getting the three leaders of these countries to reach an agreement in their trade representatives now comes the hard part and here's President Trump speaking today the White House\nAnd I plan to decide the agreement by the end of November by then we'll submitted for approval to Congress where in theory there should be no trouble but anything you submit the Congress has trouble\nOr no matter what\nThe single greatest agreement ever say they'll say well you know drug likes it therefore we're not going to approve it because that would be good for the Republicans so therefore we get to prove it\nDoes strike me though that the Republicans will still be in control of Congress at the end of November\nThey will but this will probably\nLead into next year and remember a lot of Democrats were with President Trump on this issue they wanted NAFTA\nTo be updated they felt it was very unfair to labor or they want an environmental provisions and I have not read through this entire revision nor have my sources this is thirty six chapters and he's chapters\nTen to twenty pages so it's going to take many weeks to digest this and little parts of going to be coming out like\nHow did the Florida tomato growers fair how did the avocado growers fair how does this industry or how did that industry we don't really know the nitty gritty and remember with all trade deals there are winners and losers and there's going to be people in Canada the U.S and Mexico who say yes I really\nCame out well in this I came out ahead and other people saying you did what you did what to my industry so that is going to be coming out in the next few weeks\nYeah we'll have to see the details of the world's Margolis telling about the new NAFTA known as the United states Mexico Canada agreement thanks very much to Mexico\n\nAnd\nThe Trump administration's treatment of undocumented migrant children is in the news again over the weekend the New York times published a report about a tent city in West Texas where many of these children are now being held\nThis tent city in the town of tornado Texas has been massively expanded and hundreds of immigrant minors have reportedly been ferried there from shelters elsewhere in the country in the middle of the night\nOne important no these are not the same kids who were separated from their parents at the border early in the summer some of them are still being held in process by the government\nThis is a different population these miners in the west Texas camp are mainly teenagers who were detained after trying to enter the country by themselves Leah ... is an attorney with the women's refugee commission\nTo attend can't is you know pretty remote it very far\nFrom El Paso which I think is the closest city\nThere's not a lot of vegetation is you know kind of think that ... really speak for themselves there's roads and both of those ... that are that children living quarters or they have a couple of other facilities on site dining facilities and the like but but it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the ...\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from the facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a home the environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction in basic you know basic subjects\nLearned some English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist [noise] a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly in route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have you know the attention that they need and the access that they need to you and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out emergency just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um ... the kids you know we were told the kids get work walks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of now mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really hot it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've just been transition there\nFrom a different ... and they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids I'm an IT table I think\nYeah and then the mind boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access [noise]\nUm well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "01"}
