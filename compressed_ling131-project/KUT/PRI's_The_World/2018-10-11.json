World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH in Boston a Chinese national is in an American jail today he's being prosecuted on economic espionage charges this is a big deal is the first time I suspected Chinese government spy has been brought to the U.S to face charges\nNow Jim shoe is accused of trying to steal technology from G. E. aviation through one of their employees he was caught in a sting operation in Belgium and extradited to the U.S on Tuesday according to Justice Department officials Katie better is covering the story for the New York times can you this is pretty amazing how did this thing actually go down ... it's\nUnclear whether or not the employee at G. aviation was working with the government but it's clear that GE Aviation selfish subsidiary was working with the government and was tracking communications between one of its own employees and the Chinese by Mr shoe and eventually mister\nYou can't ask the employee for more and more information and much of which were proprietary which the employee himself up\nHim or herself recognized a but still their communications continue and they eventually agreed to meet while the employer was supposed to be on a business trip in Europe that allowed the authorities to arrest Mr shoe while he was not in China in a country that had an extradition treaty with the United states\n[noise] so do we assume the employee was about to go to Belgium and then the authorities came in and said no we're actually doing the sting operation do we know kind of at the point that the employee was let on that there was going to be a sting operation\nWell it's unclear whether or not the employee actually went to Belgium him or herself we don't know that and again we don't know the extent to which the employee\nWas taking part in a sting operation or it's just being closely monitored by his or her company but we do know though from our reporters on the ground in Belgium is that Mr she was arrested while he was out ah just shopping indulge him and he claimed that in fact he wasn't there to be anybody who is just not the key shouldn't he remained very quiet\nHe thought the extradition which is one of the reasons it took so long to get him\nFrom Belgium to the United states he was rushed starch info first April Fool's day and he was extradited and arrive in the United states on Tuesday\n[noise] now this accused by ... to ... who is he and what's he's supposed to have done\nSo you want your shoe works for a China's\nLead spy agency you know they are ... one of the CIA and he was supposed to be\nCollecting intelligence for the Chinese government and one of the ways in which he would do that and she would pose as a representative a science and technology ... Institute\nA think tank there were court the employees\nOf uh of defense contractors to come to China to give talks to give academic talks and reports introduce some sort of intellectual exchange and then once the employees were brought\nTo China they'd be winding dined whereas we all know people can a maybe a little bit too for coming with information on their devices could also be compromised and at the end of the day he was also looking for employees like this in play it G aviation who at least seemed amenable to giving him information that they shouldn't\nAnd is he a big fish or a little fish in terms of Chinese intelligence\nWell I think that it's even though he was a regional director\nIt is a huge deal to the United states has charged and arrested this man because he's not going to be tried in open court so what that means is the government is going to have to bring forth all sorts of very compelling evidence that they've gathered that we don't yet know from the indictment looked prove that this man with not only by\nBut was trying to steal business secrets that could be horribly embarrassing to the Chinese government and it can reveal sort of of the extent of of a larger ring or a larger scheme\n[noise] now you mentioned that we don't really know much about the GE Aviation employee or do we know is there any details about this person know wow now\nIn reading the story I noticed that there is someone described as an uninvited co conspirator is that the GE Aviation employee or another Chinese ...\nThat is not the G aviation play is another Chinese figure are one of the question is whether or not ... is a cooperating witness and the government's case\nWhat's gonna happen too young to chew now the alleged Chinese by\nYellow await trial and you must court and he's in a U.S court said he's entitled to representation and I would assume that he would find very good attorney\nAnd what's been China's reaction to this so far muted but that could change [noise] now the\nExtradition of ... shoe is believed to be at first but Chinese industrial espionage is nothing new oh why hasn't this kind of arrest an extradition happened before\nWell we don't have an extradition treaty\nWith China and technically we can't take their people out of the country so you know in this case the U.S government was very lucky to have set up a situation where Chinese fly was willing to travel\nTo a country with an extradition treaty with the United states once we indict a Chinese military officials are Chinese government officials generally it makes public their role in the case but what it doesn't do it doesn't allow us to necessarily bring them to open court it restricts their travel\nHowever and some in some cases districts are financial or their ability to to move money around\nKatie banner is with the New York times thanks so much thank you so how common is the theft of trade secrets by the Chinese\nIn some respects I think it's overstated and yet it is prevalent at does happen\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the American chamber of commerce in China it's a nonprofit that represents U.S companies and individuals doing business there previously he was minister for commercial affairs at the U.S embassy in Beijing\nWhen I worked in the U.S embassy we had cases of trade secrets soft and they were not done actually however\nBy folks in the ministry of a security but rather by business people for commercial game so it was a little bit different\n[noise] you know this this case involves somebody who's seems rather senior I'm One of the perpetrators usually after\nIn some cases it's technology that is\nPatented in some cases it is a no how a which is not patentable but which is so important for actually producing the product when I was in the embassy uh we had a case of a major with a major us commercial glass a company\nAnd employees had actually taken these trade secrets and had used them to build a factory in a third country and we're producing products\nAre you able to tell us the name of that company [noise] I don't think\nYou know of cases though where American companies who've had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate the cases\nAs a matter of fact they have and uh the situation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of a legislation for protecting intellectual property\nBut over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly now enforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving\nThe big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property\nThat is difficult to protect why because there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it to us or over the years have worked with the Chinese in capacity building\nOther areas of pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier\nUm but uh but we're all working on it still is threats that comes with trade secret theft is it a security threat an economic one or both well I Would say uh in",
