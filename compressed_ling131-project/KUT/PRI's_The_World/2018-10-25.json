U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one Austin we our community support a public radio from UT Austin\nYeah luck since the beginning of the\nTrump presidency many of those surrounding Trump and basically told they don't pay attention to what the president of the United states says\nAnd to me a that slot analytical because Trump is given as a unique window that we've never had before into the real time thinking of a president or he puts everything out and more importantly words have\nConsequences and that example where the president in the mix of the controversy over the disappearance and apparent murder and dismembered men of Saudi journalist ...\nThe president at carrying on violence against a journalist was\nThat sort of horror find context of that comment of course it matters in my view the fact that uh subsequently we've had this wave of ... um sent to Democrats and to media figures around the country at a time when the president seems to be laughing and celebrating violence\nToward journalist you know it seems to me not only wildly on presidential but clearly\nThere is a connection between the atmosphere\nAnd which a leader is a enabling or empowering those who might be encouraged to undertake violent acts\nUsually connection to those laws as ms truth and and he called the personality you might have seen at these rallies\nAbsolutely I go back to the comment during the twenty sixteen campaign you know that I could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and they would still follow me and those who has studied this kind of rhetoric from other divisive populace figures\nHave also observed is outside of the United states the context in which a charismatic authoritarian meaning leader want people to embrace his narrative of the world even and perhaps especially so when he's promoting not facts but an alternative version of reality\nBecause that makes them more tied to him and to his view of the world\n[noise] so finally Susan how are you seeing this Trump beyond rhetoric reverberating around the globe right now\nThere's no question you know you have populations in places like Poland and Hungary cheering Trump on and actually endorsing leaders who are quite similar in many ways who came before\nTrump and so I think this is a phenomenon of political presentation of confrontation with them divisiveness the new politics of fear that is with us in many different place it how much do they inspire each other how much did they learn from each other I think there's some compelling evidence that a fair amount\nSusan Glasser with a New Yorker thanks very much thank you Susan mentioned the murder Saudi journalist ... who was killed inside the Saudi consulate in assemble there are no real questions about the role crown prince Mohammed bin ... played in all this\n... a journalist specializing in the middle east he says the ... the episode is or effect but it does present an opportunity for the United states to reset its relationship with the Saudi monarchy\nWe have a regime that has stepped over the line of international norms in a really big way in a way that has broken through to the American public and so if we are ever going to reconsider this relationship that we have in the middle east some two dozen Thirteen which is relationship with new authoritarian it should be now\nAs far as the crown prince and Saudi Arabia mom had been some on what he sees the the us role in kind of creating this persona I mean he was handed power by the father right right so\nKing saw him on elevated mama been so long to crown prince ... bin ... who was sidelined by mama been so much very few people who are privy to the internal American Asian so record but\nI think what the United States did is except those now it's not that we determined the line of succession Saudi Arabia and or should we but when the\nNew ... leader of the country ... bin ... among begins doing things that are destabilizing to regional security and that are also very detrimental to human rights\nBoth abroad and at home that's when the United states plays a role and what we've done very clearly is enable the worst tendencies of this new ... whether that's the war in Yemen in which the United states provides very important refueling and intelligence support\nAnd other aspects of it we probably don't know that aren't public but in\nNot really creating any penalties for increased repression at home or\nWhat's much more closely tied to the ... case is the essentially the kidnapping and rendition\nOf dissidents abroad those dissidents and members of the royal family this has been going on now for a few years and you can draw more or less direct live from all of these\nAuthoritarian behaviors and bomb and been so long to the apparent attempt to kidnap Ocean City and his murder\nSo if you have Donald Trump's ear right now what would you tell them what would be the way forward\nWell I Would probably tell him that this is the Saudi regime that has essentially violated various sort of\nWith America and how it would do business has made the Senate and the administration look very bad\nWhich I think matters especially to the president is not a good deal in fact the American Saudi relationship I've argued for a fundamental rethinking if not breaking off of the whole thing you've got a president who's very transactional has\nTalked about hundreds of thousands or a million jobs\nBeing created by arms of study when in fact arms sales to Saudi Arabia the hundred and ... and roughly a hundred billion dollars that were from is I Believe in guns and tea very small percentage of that has actually been signed we're obligated in any way and will create may be some thousands of jobs\nMany of those jobs are going to be in Saudi Arabia so I think that even from a transactional ... perspective\nLeaving aside the human rights perspective is not a good deal for the United states\nWhat would you like to hear specifically out of the White House right now what would you think would be a good thing to hear\nWhat we need to hear from the White House is that the our first they're going to take the letter from Congress initiating an investigation under the global Magnitsky Act seriously and that they're going to truly investigators wherever it leads\nAnd then they'll listen to their information being provided by the intelligence community so that the thing is not going to be swept under the rug and that they will follow it wherever it leads and if that means that\nThe killing of genetic Herschel gee implicates the highest levels of the Saudi court including crown prince momma did some on that there will be serious consequences for Mohammad been so long\nAnd additionally I think that in in support for the war in Yemen and ending the arms sales regime with Saudi Arabia which fuels they're sort of disastrous adventures in the region or both steps the Trump Administration should take that would not be harmful to the to the average Seventy since\n... a

GBH here in Boston\nThe Trump Administration said this week it's considering scrapping unimportant Cold War treaty the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty also known as I N F\nIt was signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Nineteen eighty seven they agreed not to develop missiles with ranges between three hundred and three thousand miles the goal prevent a surprise nuclear attack using this medium range missiles that still seems like a good thing so why scrap it now as we\nTo earlier this week the U.S accuses Russia of violating the treaty but there is a good argument to be made but the move to scrap it may have more to do with China\nChina has never been a signatory of the treaty\nThat's Laura Seligman she's Pentagon correspondent for foreign policy\nAnd style as such it has been able to build up over the past Twenty years Thirty years a vast arsenal of conventional weapons in that intermediate range that now threatening freedom of navigation in the region and they can threaten us ships particularly our\nCarriers that are very vulnerable and the fact that the U.S is a party to that treaty and China is not as really hamstrung that United States military in the region from protecting ourselves but not just protecting ourselves the author protecting our allies\nSo since Nineteen eighty seven when the treaty was signed China has been arming up a as China\nEver been invited to sign on to the high enough treaty\n[noise] they're not ... not that that I Know of\nSome that people I spoke to said this pulling out of the treaty without even sort of extending an indication to China and joined even symbolically that came as a little bit of a surprise it probably would have looked a little better for the United states at least try\nOr up here to try to get China Internet shady but those officials also said that that was no way that\nThe Chinese military was going to be willing to give up that missiles that it has developed over the past twenty Thirty years\nYou're just because these are conventional missiles that the Chinese have not nuclear ones\nYeah that's true and wind twenty Eighteen this China's missile arsenal frighten us warplanes\nYou have the ... the U.S has been handcuffed to deploying these kind of intermediate range missiles by ship or by plane and I know in the Pacific air these\nVast vast distances that means it's very very expensive to fly bombers or have ships going around the the F ... we're we're losing a lot of money were not able to strike at promptly and if we can put conventional\nConventional like I said not nuclear weapons in the south China Sea or\nStation then with our allies in Japan Vietnam then that would give us a much more prompt more flexible options\nYou know so ... what you're saying is that China with what has got right now could potentially force the U.S navy to retreat hundreds of miles with these kind of deterrent missiles\nAbsolutely in fact they already are that's been happening for the past five or ten years the U.S navy has been warning that that\nIncreasing sophistication of that China will\nNot held an anti missile systems anti aircraft that had been for saying that aircraft carrier in particular that cash strapped grave further and further from the shore making us less and less effective at enforcing freedom of navigation and the interest of our allies in bad Pacific region\nRight so the danger to our allies like Japan or Taiwan or the Philippines if the U.S Navy's forced to retreat from those a Chinese missiles that would expose those hours right\n[noise] yes absolutely so ascribing the IMF treaty someone say makes sense on one level but could trigger an arms race with China\nI think that that is certainly something that people are are a little bit concerned about and not just in China obviously with Russia as well\nSo what happens next was Congress need to vote before the treaty is scrapped\nKnow that President can pull out of that treaty unilaterally that what happened is that administration needs fixing a notification to say that it's playing out of the treaty and then I Believe there is a six month period before it actually takes effect\nSo Congress can object and make it difficult but the president can unilaterally collapse and I will I Will just just say that there have been reports John Bolton and knock out right now\nJust recently said we're not going bad quickly on last I Know we've announced that we are going to talk to our allies first but it does make this seem pretty inevitable that we're going to get out of the treaty\nLower Seligman Pentagon correspondent for foreign policy thing for foreign policy thanks for being with us thank you\nThe Chinese government is also asserting his power domestically exhibit a a crackdown against the weaker ethnic group in western China the leaders are a Muslim minority in ... province on the world we've talked about the Chinese government's mass surveillance and detentions of thousands of leaders in huge prison camps\nThe government calls that cultural re education\nWas talked about the Chinese leaders enlisting more than a million Chinese civilians\nMembers of the Han ethnic majority to help with the education Darren ... an anthropology professor at the University of Washington he's been following this closely\nThey're asking people to go into weaker villages into their homes and teach them how to be hard to simulate and they're also at the same time taking large numbers of leaders could be up to a million ... out of their homes out of their villages and into a re education camps system where there's more intensive training happening\nI'm so there's multiple approaches some people are still in their homes and villages and being told to assimilate there and others are being sent into these prison camps\nAnd what are they actually doing they're like what is a normal day of re education at a weaker home look like\nMost of the pond civilians that are coming into the homes are only saying for a period of a week two a month in some cases\nI typically looks like is a lot of political events there's often flag raising ceremony you go out and you swear allegiance to the Communist Party there's a red songs singing patriotic songs singing activities\nThere's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there is also cultural events that people participate in their drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticent to doing this sort of thing because for ... Saddam is not comic activity all of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing they are to participate in Hong cultural activities one of the things that the manuals that the hanta billions use one of the things that they advocate is that you ask the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the allegiance of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes they report on their host to like some higher authority\nYeah that's one of the primary goals of what they're doing a suspect finding mission so they have these manuals that they're using their spots in these manuals that they fill out whatever activities that have been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls of the home that sort of thing\nThey're making recommendations as to whether or not these wig or is that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education were not\nHow are the leaders reacting to this\nWell many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes\nHave told me that the experiences of pretty extreme form of maternal is them a kind of in ... they feel like it's a violation of their personal space and up their family life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Austin", "day": "25"}
