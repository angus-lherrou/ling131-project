know terrorists they're dealing with people who are not us citizens when in fact\nThey're dealing with you know millions and millions of US citizens and legal residents and all kinds of people\nLiving in the United states they become the largest federal law enforcement agency now in the U.S but they don't have the same oversight or the same um requirements that you know your local police department has\nWhat does President Trump said about his intentions to continue to expand customs and border protection well and this\nIs the thing he wants to add five thousand more agents and\nAgain we're talking about more agents that there's been no discussion about oversight there's been no discussion about the internal affairs um and how it's it's lacking in in oversight and ah how the system is really\nSort of built to let misconduct and obese happen with little um repercussion\nWhy does lower than of I'll ask you to give her a pseudonym and the story that's not her real name and your clear about that in the piece yeah no\nIt's it's not her real name and and she's still afraid of of a retaliation I'm\nYou know it was a traumatic experience for her because she was held for five hours her family didn't know where she was they took away her cell phone they subjected her to various cavity search is an X rays and CAT scans and and\nYou know assaulted her um basically and it's a strange experience to have when it's your government that's done that to you um she said that was maybe the\nOne of the worst parts of it was that it was supposed to be good guys that did that to her and not criminals that did that ... to her and and that she's still very conflicted and and and sort of traumatized by the whole thing\nThis is think I'm Chris Boyd\nYet she told you that she didn't want to go back to what is not because she has any concerns about what his which was you know how to had a reputation for a long time as being really dangerous city what scares are is crossing back into the U.S\nYeah I mean that that really makes you think right yeah because what has has quite a has had quite a reputation recently for um violence\nAnd you hear most people talking about that but she's actually more worried about coming back into the United states because of what happened to her and and the thought that it could happen again she's actually moved\nOutside the one on one hundred miles zone and further away from the border so that she's hopefully out of the purview of the of the border patrol\nSo if I stopped at a border checkpoint and subjected to questioning under detention do I have the right to remain silent\nYou do have the right to remain silent um that does does does it always work out so great but uh but legally yes you do um have have that right and then they can hold you in secondary um until they can\nYou know determine some way that you are a U.S citizen there's a whole genre of uh videos actually on YouTube of people who have gone through these checkpoints and refused to answer those questions and you can see what\nThe sort of process that they go through and sort of just stating their rights as citizens not to have the you know to be questioned or to be searched\nAnd do I get I'm Miranda warning in that circumstance a that's a good question [laughter] so it's not necessarily part of the political\nNo no I mean they can they can do suspicion was searches that these are these checkpoints um I think at some point it it to LA it escalates into probable cause they have to have probable cause\nUm but they have quite a lot of authority at these checkpoints and at the border\n[noise] do you have the sense that Americans um feel like this is something that they support simply because they want to feel that the country is safe or do you feel like this is just something that people don't know is happening and therefore don't object to\nWell I think people want to\nKnow that the country safe right and they and they want you know agents at the border protecting the country from\nYou know terrorists and in contraband and things that are coming across that I don't think most people\nUnderstand the sweeping authority that they have and the uh extent of their area of jurisdiction I think most people are really shocked and surprised by that when they encounter them somewhere and not you know anywhere near the border\nI think people find that surprising\nDo administrators at customs and border protection acknowledge that there are some problems um I think\nYou know there was a period of of reform that was going on there at CBP or around twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen before uh\nBefore a President Trump oh came into\nOffice where they were sort of acknowledging that there were issues that needed to be fixed and and that's when they put together that homeland security advisory council to look at um\nExcessive use of force they've had a lot of accusations of excessive use of force 'em and misconduct and corruption so they were looking at that they released their um use of force policies because those were kept secret nobody really knew what their use of force policies were\nUm so they were actually working on reform and then that kind of all just\nCame to stop 'em with the with the new president is there evidence that these\nActivities this expanded customs and border protection administration these checkpoints is there evidence that they're making a safer\nI don't think there is I mean if you look at their statistics of their from their interior checkpoints you know only two percent of the people that they detain are actually undocumented um everybody else it's usually for low level drug\nUh a possession um I mean mostly who they're detaining are us citizens [noise]\nKeeps adjustments for people traveling anywhere in the country that they will find themselves within this hundred mile borders on\nWell I mean I never make jokes will tell you that [laughter] I take it very I take them very seriously because they have like I said a lot of sweeping authority\nAnd uh\nUm you know I'm I'm just a respectful and you know I'm a U.S citizen and then you know I tried to keep it limited to that

I think people are going to be having a lot of tough conversations at home\nSo that twenty eight will be a really historic day here whichever way it goes\nJournalist Shannon sense based in Rio de Janeiro thanks very much for helping us understand this vote at least a round one will come back around to thanks so much thanks very interests\nAlso in the news today Interpol it's an organization that gets easily associated with crime and intrigue solving crime mysteries is their job after a while but now the chief of Interpol is smack dab in the middle of a mystery himself\n... way is his name and his wife live in ... in France and that's where Interpol headquarters are located and last week ... wife grace reporter to French police but ... had just disappeared vantage twelve traveling in China\nThe latest is this among who's also a Chinese security officials seems to be the target of an anti corruption crackdown\nThe Chinese Communist party said yesterday that it had detained him on suspicion of violating the law Edward wrong has been covering this the New York times I asked him if the charges are legitimate or more of a political move by Chinese President Xi Jinping\nIt's unclear there's since she took power in twenty twelve to anti corruption campaign touched on all aspects of the party and some of the people that have been taken down or political rivals have has and some are\nPeople who are genuinely guilty of corruption but sort of many officials within the party system um so it's unclear right now why they've targeted Mr among\nSo you you wrote in the New York times that quote the detention of Mr mom is an audacious step by the party even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of president Xi Jinping those are pretty strong words can you just put this move this detention by the Chinese government in context for us and in the frame of this anti corruption a battle\nSure I'm there have been very senior officials who have been taking down and have been detained or and then eventually in prison for life under this campaign and bill and other political purge that she was carrying out but there hasn't been a notice to show that has helped such a high position with the international organization\nWho has been taken down China's been trying to gain legitimacy in the world stage for years out and it seeks to hold high positions in world organizations whether it's Interpol or the world Trade Organization or the IMF for them to do this to pull this person put them\nIn detention not clear about the reasons why I did this this is\nIn my view it's a huge blow to sort of like the quest for legitimacy on the world stage I China it's undertaking yes so what\nDoes this situation domain for any recognition that trend has gotten through monks position at ...\nI think I'll be a setback I think that organizations will question what might happen if they decide to put a senior Chinese official in these positions are in power um there's no telling what the party and I do and there's no transparency about their process or any sort of legal process or ... or a process that they undertake\nSo I think people will have second thoughts about this\nInterestingly a few hours after the Chinese Communist party and announce it had Dr among in custody Interpol then announced that he had resigned as their chief what do you make of that\nI think that the Communist Party and its anti corruption agency specifically must have put pressure on Mr among to issue resignation letter to Interpol\nAnd dumped her mom was also vice minister and the Chinese ministry of public security does he still hold that role\nAh what usually happens ease investigations he's at this anti corruption agency announced the Chinese and indebted out so don't say that they've stripped him of his party membership of official titles and a political rights\nAnd what what are you hearing among experts in trying to watch or do they believe Dr among isn't any danger\nIt depends on how you defined danger or\nHe probably is at risk of imprisonment once you start this type of investigation\nIt usually becomes very serious especially if they made an announcement of very explicit announcement about him possibly violating the law so ah we're looking at some sort of prison time for him because once they move to the criminal process than a court will almost certainly find him guilty and send them to present it could be prison for life depending on the circumstances\nI'm I'm sure he said what what can you tell us about what Chinese think about Xi Jinping's crack down I mean this sensibly it's anti\nCorruption but do many Chinese see it that way\nYou know Chinese can be fairly skeptical about people in power\nSo that can play both ways wonder skeptical about local officials and they really believe local officials are crap so they think that any crackdown done by Beijing is a good thing but also they can be very skeptical about the motivations behind such crack down so I think that Chinese can see both ways but in general because they see\nA local officials as being corrupt in many places around China then You're welcome to crack down like this\nEdward Long diplomatic corresponded with the New York times very much that's\nWaiting to see now whether among faces trial in China in Spain a verdict today in a case let's grab people's attention there for a long time the defendant an eighty five year old gynecologist he's charged with stealing babies from New mothers during the dictatorship of general Francisco Franco\nThis one case though it was part of a much wider scandal that involves thousands of babies stolen from left wing opponents of Franco's regime and given to conservative couples for adoption the BBC's Lucy Williamson is in Madrid where the verdict was announced\nWell this is a story that began in Nineteen sixty nine when a woman called in as much as they go was taken from her mother straits off to the spy a gynecologist scooped up to the vet and he said ... and it was to give a as a gift to another couple\nTen years ago and it's just adopted mother told the truth and she has been investigating and campaigning to try and get dumped ... brought to trial that that's what happened today we had a verdict in the trial of ...\nAnd he was found guilty of all the time she was charged with a related to in is but in a twist he was also able to walk free because the court ruled that the statute of limitations didn't allow them to put him in jail\nThe woman at the heart of the lawsuit in Madrid go says she will appeal but ... also says she feels some measure of justice already even if the doctor who stole her from her parents was allowed to walk free today\nI mean the main bought a second I Am but I don't think it's I don't mind that she's not going to jail that's not the most important thing it'll be very difficult for him to leave the house because everyone recognized everyone will know what he did so for me thinking dead and anyway it up on ...\nDr Edward ... is the first person to go to trial for illegal adoptions under Franco dictatorship reaction was mixed today from people whose families were affected again here's my BBC colleague loosely Williamson\nThere were lots of mothers outside the court today who they themselves but leave that to that and you will and babies were taken in a similar way and the campaign is saying that they may be thousands tens of thousands even of children who were taken in the same way as it is\nStill reading that reaction that was that was happiness that this had\nHappened to tool that somebody had been found guilty of a crime like this because it's been a very long journey to try and get any official recognition but of course the fact that he was able to walk free um was was a source of of distress one mother said it's like being slapped in the face\nThe BBC's loosely Williamson reporting there from Madrid [noise]\nComing up un
