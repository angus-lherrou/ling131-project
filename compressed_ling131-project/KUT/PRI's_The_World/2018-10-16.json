know and you understand loss but you've lost someone you love to parent a sibling um because to be told that someone can't understand it's almost like they're opting out ... um and they're telling you\nThat um you know there was this person you were before you went to war\nAnd I couldn't understand everything that person had been through but then you went to war and you had this experience of forever changed you and so now there's some part of the few that will always be an understandable unrecognizable to the\nRest of us who are the ... from what she left and if that's true it means that I never get to go back to being the person I was before I left so means actually never got to come home\nSo you know in many respects the homecoming is the sense of coming back\nBeing understood and being reintegrated and that's something that I think you know just anybody wants most people were just walking through the world wanting to be understood [laughter] um and for the narrator I think that's the most central thing he's sitting in this wide space this like as you said Christmas fog\nAnd maybe the only thing that maybe the only thing that gets them out of the fog and having you the reader understand Mary story and understand his store and just saying you know I get it\nHow did you try to make yourself understood to the people in your personal life\n[noise] tell stories\nYou tell stories you showing pictures you you know you spend time together um but that's not it's not like there's a a neat fence around like the war I think we're all doing that on her personal life constantly with you know you come home from work honey how is your [laughter]\nYou know you just want to be understood and that's what's so much I think about relationships in a marriage is like you know just to people wanting to be understood and wars and an intimacy is when two people really feel like they understand each other and and do something together\nYeah and this that and just interesting tension between wanting to understand someone you care about and and honestly there are things we don't want to understand about them 'cause they're hard to accept\nMhm yeah I think that's true\nYou're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd\nLet's go back to the phones now the number one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to let's speak with ... in Austin Hi by other\nRight um I just wanted to ask what what about the parallel I'm In that you don't know very good book Janet ... or ... or you're the actual hamlet adult and try to both of guys that were kicked out of Hollywood or well during the correct here anyway\nBut the judgments day for a long number one number two why it is a nurse that\nIn a way to gauge them and the\nThe soldier World War one soldier fate lately she's lost all of us limb she's lost his ability to communicate directly with the world that are you an Irish shakes on a ... a late the rest of that tree or magic ...\nThanks for your call 'em\nHey Bob and thanks yes no I'm I'm very familiar with adult and Trump those work into Johnny got his gun and I think there's a real you know there is a tradition of what you call locked in narratives I mean the book the English Patient is a number of another example this narrative\nA and a book of a memoir by\nA French author who himself suffered locked in syndrome and then died what's called the diving bell and the butterfly um\nSo you know as a device I think it's an interesting narrative device and one I obviously use myself which is having someone who is completely\nCut off and and accessible in certain ways um and how they come back from that and I think it's you know it's a powerful metaphor on one that I was inclined to use for the store\n[noise] so I Want to ask this question without making it sound like I'm a salad dressing you because it's not my intention here but but you mentioned that you left the service in two thousand eleven you keep returning to combat zones in your fiction\nIs they're part of you that feels you can't entirely pull your consciousness away from from war\n[noise] um well pathology eyes away field [laughter] the no um\nYou know I'm a writer and I you know and I write about I've written about what I Know\nI'm you know also you know what is sometimes not seeing what bus come out is that they're written over time and then you know they get published and oftentimes by the time a book is\nFinished the writing the book is finished it can be a couple of years and tell us published so I'm the work I'm working on now\nUm is less rooted in these wars is actually the last book a mind that is rooted in these wars and my next novel um ... that's coming out of his all set in Istanbul around the Gezi Park protests ah I Do I think ten to write about uh books that are you know an engagement clause I'd political themes\nUm but that's just more a function of my interest\nUm however you know these stories green on blue dark at the crossing and I'm\nWaiting for eight and you know are are are set\nA round wars in the middle east and I think it's just mainly because that's what I was engaged in the last ten years\nAnd um you know and those were sort of the events that defined I'm back decade um so you know I keep coming back to them but uh you know I think the thing of the larger themes that I Do keep coming back then probably you know like a dog to his opponent won't get off of our these themes of\nFatality what it means to be in a marriage what it means to what it means a lot of um those are sort of the reason that violence you know those are probably a magic things I'm going to continue to be interested in throughout my writing for\nThe last thing I Want to ask you about is the challenge of using a narrator who um doesn't doesn't have as much money presumably as much formal education as you as not as as good with words as you are you've got to give him this power to communicate all these complicated feelings\nAnd yet the the paint box that you've given yourself with language is more limited than what\nYou Elliot Ackerman would have to you\n\nYou know why some you know the thing that's fun about being a novelist and interesting is that you create a world\nAh and as you're writing your creating this whole world and the rules that world or in many respects determined by you\nAnd whether or not a novel succeeds or failed is not necessarily whether or not as realistic but it's whether or not the novelist and here's to the rules that he or she is set out ... in that world and um\nSo if you're going to draw certain type of character you need to you need to have them be true to form and so that includes things like language um\nAnd I assure you you know a friend is my first book which was all written in the first person from Afghans perspective the language challenges there were\nWere greater than the language challenges of you know an American who might not have the exact same background that I have\nAckerman novels include green on blue dark at the crossing and now waiting for Eden Eliot it's always a pleasure thanks for making time for oh yeah my great pleasure thank you

U. T. Austin\nSalvador Dali mates Rikers Island today on the world\nMarket warm in the Nineteen sixty five Salvador Dali ages ran into the head of the New York city jail for him at a dinner party but came up with a plan to have Dolly visit Rikers Island ... he was sitting both\nWhich the inmates and also give them for Dolly got sick on the day he was supposed to go so he a wife to painting together in about two hours of or the crucifixion\nMaybe had a good friend of his deliver it to Rikers as an apology that painting what basically unnoticed inside the prison for forty years until it was stolen ocean's eleven but better but stories and much more coming your way right here today on the world\nThey started to unravel it but like there are still you know if you keep you can always find new strands because there's so much activity out there and so there's still the investigation is ongoing\nWhat has been the biggest challenge for Facebook tackling fake news and men are\nA lot of it has to do with two things basically language and the cultural context um you have to be able to hire people who can\nRead all of these posts and understand the cultural context they're coming from a lot of people complain that the people that Facebook is hired some times haven't lived in Myanmar for a decade so they may not be sort of up\nTo date on the newest means or the newest references and so they might miss some of the stuff that I think you know at this point they have they think about Seventy people doing content review they're gonna up at two hundred the question is you know when you have Eighteen million people doing this in a in a military campaign with hundreds of people you know how many people do you need to kind of\nPersonally review all this stuff and and at the answers a lot more than a hundred I think\nI mean it is really kind of extraordinary the story that you've got a government weaponized ... social media against its own people are are there any examples of governments anywhere else in the world that are doing this\nSo ... is it pretty galling example um I'm not really aware of that having done anywhere else um\nAnd you know a lot of it comes back to the legacy of of the Myanmar military out there it's you know ... a very complex country but it's worth remembering that the most powerful political organization and Myanmar remains the military and it you know technically gave a power and and kind of\nBrought up this you know allowed to this democracy to happen but but it's still sits behind in the shadows still the most powerful actor in the country and so this is one of the ways that it's tried to kind of wheeled that power from the shadows to make sure it remains relevancy even as you know democracy to start to kind of\nYou know take route and and and become seeing in the country\nCongress has you know it's been a pressing in Silicon valley to clamp down on this stuff by kind of tightening up their own systems making them more rigorous but are you also seeing evidence that Washington is not pressing these governments like mommy andme our government to stop this kind of online campaign as hard as it could\nCertainly I think it's the kind of thing that now that it's out there a government do need to push back harder\nAnd certainly we've seen US government you know in the Trump Administration to be somewhat flipped out about the social media campaigns that the Russians have done and you know we see that playbook now spreading pretty quickly um and so I think it's worth having governments do more in stand up more because also it's negligent ... has been\nTo some degree it is hard to put all of the onus on a on a company or you know if you have one corporate actor\nThey're dealing with the men were military and their Seventy years of propaganda history insane Man March in China there talking to the Chinese Communist party and try and we'll end deal to get in there than in Vietnam they're dealing with another you know ... secretive government\nThrowing a new law them I mean basically if you want if your Facebook and you have to manage this problem you basically need your own State Department and you need to start\nBasically looking like a government so I Do think it's important that governments come out here and give some cover and give some protection to these these companies because\nThe problems are facing are intractable and there are so large that you need a sort of you know the power of real nation states to kind of way in and at least ... some kind of a guy you know\nPaul ... author of the New York times thanks a lot really appreciate it thanks America\nWho are your ancestors where were you born answers the questions like that can be illuminating but those questions can also be troubling when politicians are involved they become campaign fodder case in point Senator Elizabeth Warren Native American ancestry or not\nPresident Trump turned that question into an opposition attack years ago Warren trying to put the matter to rest this week by disclosing the results of her DNA Analysis we want it to look beyond the politics of all this there's more from the world's ...\nAlong with the DNA report Warren released the stadiums my mother's name Reid wasn't hard now it's all black and white photos interspersed with members of Warren ... family in Norman, Oklahoma reminiscing about the stories their elders Easter time\nNot emerald try and only trying to determine tribal I understand in family history is my family\n... brewer hears that a lot and a contributing editor for tribal affairs at high country ... and ... and I'm not much darker than her her being Warren brewer understands her desire to honor family stories\nGrowing up in Oklahoma a lot of people have a story about a native ancestor or native relative and they think yeah I was told by my family that I'm part native\nBut he says that's actually pretty easy to verify and in the case of the Cherokee Nation that process doesn't involve a DNA test\nTracing your native heritage air lineage is actually very\nSimple for a lot of people because when the U.S government was attempting to commit genocide a native peoples they documented us meticulously\nNearly two hundred years ago the U.S government agreed on a policy of removing Native Americans from their land and they are going to fish\nTo find people as Native American based on their ancestry they called it blood quantum basically what percentage of your blood is native\nAbout two thirds of the tribes in the U.S still use the amount of ancestry that a person has in that tried to determine citizenship says even a route a Cherokee citizen and retired research professor at Boston College\nShe says the other third don't use that criteria anymore because as people started marrying outside of the tribes some children and grandchildren couldn't meet the standards qualify so those tribes instead asked members for proof\nThat they are descended from one of the people on the U.S government lists made so long ago\nThey want to know whether someone family dentist side in formal political legal terms with the tribe\nIn other words if an ancestor identified as native with all the benefits and drawbacks like racism that came with that distinction that earns them citizenship not DNA group says because Cherokee isn't a racial group\nIt's a legal and political term for someone who's a citizen of a sovereign nation just like citizens and said France or the U.S\nThe bottom line is that when you put the question who is an Indian person the only thing you can really meaningful meaningfully say it was getting and for what purpose\nAnd the purpose maybe very personal Kim told there is an associate professor of native studies at the University of Alberta she's sending from the shy in and around the ... tribes of Oklahoma and she thinks some people watch ... native so they don't feel implicated in American colonialism\nAnd to to assuage one's guilt with being with that being somebody who has benefited from the genocide in his possession of indigenous peoples from their land as many Americans have so I think if somebody can claim that they're Native American they don't feel implicated in\nWith the Trump warns that Rebecca Nagl says American leaders are again leading the conversation about who is native non native people needles a member of the Cherokee Nation and says she's been criticized by other Democrats for speaking out against war and on this issue including in appearances on Fox News\nAnd either people who have the power and authority to shape policy over arts and those people really really believe that DNA any legitimacy when in Congress station about native identity need very scary\nBecause Nagl already has her identity questioned\nWhen people on the street I looked like a white person on and I think that\nSo many white people aren't sure each ... each year he puts me

GBH here in Boston here's\nA story we're probably going to hear a lot about in the run up to the mid term elections next month another caravan of migrants heading north from Central America\n[laughter] I\nGuess we could chanted the migrants after crossing from Honduras into Guatemala yesterday today President Trump threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if the migrants continue their march Guatemalan journalist Louisa ... has been watching the progress of the caravan\nIs heartbreaking to see\nAmount of people\nThink praying with choosing them babies and the ...\nThe average is walking and then you see the issue\nSince the ... not ... to the weather conditions hearing what am I we have a lot of raining right now so they will reach the Mexican border I think come on Sunday and then we'd be a very huge crises in divorce\nSo they're on their way now to Guatemala City these sixteen hundred marchers right what what is the scene as they're walking along or the other walking along a highway\nLast night days back then if we're not fifty left is a big seating near the border with less\nAnd there were around two thousand people on the park in a shelter and everywhere they they were sleeping almost into three\nSo the caravan started in San Pedro Sula Honduras San Pedro Sula was once the the murder capital of the world it's still a dangerous city why do the marchers say they're fleeing Honduras\nViolent gang violence and the other part is they are with nothing not having jobs not having any money\nMakes them very well liberal\nYeah so are fleeing poverty we've heard a lot about that and the violence as well I mean there was a a Honduran congressmen ... who tweeted they are not seeking the American dream they're fleeing\nHonduras nightmare so that certainly squares with violence and the violence stories we're hearing Luis why are they doing this march this time of year why now\nIn ... they gather equal and begin to march\n... it is legal to seek asylum in the U.S even if you don't have papers so people who present themselves the ports of entry or not violating any laws how much do these migrants no that large segments of American society are not going to welcome them\nAs far as I guess he only a few of them know about asylum the other ones I just marching to the border I think they believe they can just entered the countries I don't think they are aware of the of the ... the border\nVice president Mike Pence told presidents in the region and Central America this week to stop migrants from ... north than President Trump has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras but our leaders in the region able to stop these marchers\nAs far as I can hear in Guatemala and they are not doing anything to stop them because it will not possible\nWe don't have enough resources to stop them and get them back to the to the border with them because they are they are a lot of families a lot of children a lot of the uh learn to people and they are just crossing every road they can\nThe United states provides a about a hundred and Seventy five million dollars in aid to Honduras that was the last fiscal year if President Trump cut off that aid what would that do to Honduras do you think\nOh it's going to be very very bad for North Dakota I mean\nHow would Guatemala feel if a these Honduran migrants were to just stay in Guatemala how would people feel about the\nPeople that are not happy with the marchers here\nThere are of course a lot of people ... them and giving them food water ... because they are just crossing the country but they want to stay with no resources live no money just staying in the part that is a huge crisis when they faring that crisis\nGuatemalan journalist Luis aside to keeping his eyes on nearly two thousand Honduran marchers who are moving through Guatemala is being with us from Guatemala City Luis thank you\nThank you there is a lot of uncertainty facing migrants who make it to the U.S Mexico border especially families with children\nUnder the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy thousands of families have been separated at the border in fact according to a recent report by Amnesty International thousands more families were separated and the government has previously disclosed Brian griffey is a researcher at Amnesty International\nI imagined this the Brazilian grandmother named Maria ... death threats by a police officer who was involved with criminal groups in Brazil\nShe had a developmentally disabled grandson over whom she had legal custody we visited her in detention in El Paso she had been there for almost a year after simply seeking protection at the U.S Mexico border\nAfter a day or two in detention they separate them from each other and they remain separated for most of the next year\nThe grandson was put into the custody of the Connecticut state children's services and they'd even sought to strip her of her legal guardianship this is clearly not the best interest of the child and it was something that was done fairly also to compel her to give up for asylum claim and go back to Brazil a few years ago this would've been a clear cut asylum case\nWill get back to the case of Maria and her grandson but first I wanted griffey to tell us about the new embassy international report\nBasically what we know is that the department of homeland security has not made public\nAn official count on the families and the number of children affected what we hear from authorities are kind of a patchwork of conflict in statistics the department of homeland security from April nineteenth to August fifteenth alone separated over six thousand family members to cross the border regularly\nBut from the numbers they shared with us it appears that number is about twenty twenty five percent higher at a minimum\nEven when they provided us with these statistics they couldn't tell us whether they were talking about the number of individuals or the number of families to separate it that's a big difference and they also went to back to a class action lawsuit under which there'd been about twenty five twenty six hundred families that were separated\nBut it appears that about eight hundred other people were separated beyond what they'd just those some of this class action lawsuit\nYour report lays out three ways that the Trump Administration policies affect people coming to the U. S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration was separated families was not just to be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seekers indefinitely if you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present and you kind of risks of society or biscuits lead that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nAnd then right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico\nAnd tons of that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that the U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport those asylum seekers back to the very countries where they fled persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law and international law so there are these three interlocking policies\nAnd since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress have come to is asking for more information we're hopeful that\nAs we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more force coming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson Brian griffey says Amnesty International was president of Murray's final immigration hearing and it wasn't looking good for\nWe actually witness as the judge such compel her in the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson with special needs before being deported back to Brazil", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "16"}
