test to drive a car\nSo [laughter] I don't know [laughter]\nIt's just I've got all her geographic [laughter] All right I Know [laughter]\nUm let's go next to chip in San Antonio hardship\nHi how are you very well thanks um\nThere's a couple of things I'd like to say both of my grandmothers were nurses\nUm both of them born before the turn of the previous century and both of them were really really pro rosy wary because they had been\nIn situations where they had to deal with the results of what had been ... a trip to abortion ... or an attempt to write abortion [noise] um my next point is\nIf we are going to as a society make sure that nobody gets any of the information\nThat would make it\nAlso I I mean it's not just access to birth control its access to information about relationships and motions and how those things tend to\nHave to play but in a world believes in you know just say no and abstinence only writer to have those kinds of problems\nWhat do you think Joni mhm\nI agree a hundred percent I actually was reading a statistic and I don't want to give the number 'cause I think I'm going to get it wrong but it was looking at a map of the number of states where consent is taught as part of sex ed and I think it was less than seven\n...\nI mean so that's sort of is supporting what you're saying chip but I agree I agree a hundred percent I think that that it isn't just handing out the contraception is understanding the nature of relationships it's understanding how to say no it's understanding\nOr how your body works um I was doing work with a a Planned Parenthood in northern New England and they were talking about\nHow they've gone into prison systems because there's a woman in a prison in northern New England who got pregnant only because she had no idea how her own body worked\nVicious think I'm Chris Boyd what did you learn about the ways that the threats of violence has shaped the experience of people who work at that reproductive health clinics Mm\n[noise] well it it's very interesting because when you you go to visit a clinic even one in Boston for example\nUm where there are multiple clinics that you can choose from if you do you want to use their services um there are metal detectors there are guards outside I'm now there are lines of protesters not like they're on the south but\nThey too have you know systems in place locked doors and one way mirrored up windows um but it's still it's it's really um shocking to walk past a gauntlet of activists [noise] you know it's like we said\nNobody wants to have an abortion so you're there you're not feeling great anyway [laughter] you know you have to ... you're literally running a gauntlet as people are screaming at you throwing things that you and handing you these little things called blessing bags which your bags full of things like soap pure L\nAnd baby booties and you know information about how you can give your baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion now what's really interesting is that you keep in mind that at these reproductive health clinics Ninety seven percent of Planned Parenthood's work\nHas nothing to do with abortions it has to do with cancer screenings an STD screenings and contraception and health care women's health care\nSo a lot of these people who are going into the clinics are there because you know maybe they're getting a gun a logical exam and they're not even pregnant but they're being handed the bags and being told don't abort your baby I mean it it's a very uh ... situation for any woman to have to get healthcare and\n[noise] um you write that laws are black and white and you mentioned this earlier the lives of women are thousands\nShades of gray what can we do with the reality that these days a lot of Americans seem to prefer thinking about things in black and white terms we we prefer to skip past the the possibility that shades of gray might actually contains ...\nWell you know I I have a plan for that [laughter] [laughter]\nI Do I actually think it comes down to stories and I'm looking at the the foreigners of you know of of this um of change let's leave it at that like for example I think that the reason we have\nA federally recognized gay marriage in the United states\nIs because of something that Harvey Milk did which is encouraging people who are gay to speak up not to hide in the shadows but to to tell their parents to come out to to make people realize that being gay is not some weird\nFringe thing but you know your neighbors gay girl cousins gay your uncle may be gay um you know any of those things so\nYou demystify this Gary ... of of the whole situation and and when people don't know stuff that's when they imagine the worst so I I realize it's an incredibly personal issue\nTo have an abortion and I also realize this is something that clearly stays with the women who have them but I Hope that there will be women who are brave enough more than just twenty five\nIf as in my study to step forward and say I had an abortion and here's why let me tell you my story because I think even if you consider yourself to be pro life\nYou may hear elements of a woman's story that you recognize or that speak to you or that you can understand\nAnd that's the way we begin to break down that barrier of black and white we we literally show them all the shades of gray\n... so we may not solve the things we disagree about but we can solve the distance between\nPeople of different idea yeah\nExactly I think what we hopefully can do is get to a point where we are not judging someone else for making a decision we would not personally make\nThe newest novel by author ... ... it's called the spark of light ... thank you so much for solving by really appreciate your time\nIt

World Service P. R. I. N. W. GBH here in Boston\nWhat a difference a few days and making U.S Canada relations last week President Trump was talking about why he didn't want to have a one on one meeting with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau to discuss trade\nCause us tariffs are too high and he doesn't seem to want to move and I've told them forget about it and frankly with thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada that's the mother lode that's the big one a were very unhappy with the negotiations and dean negotiating style of Canada\nYesterday with the new U.S Canada Mexico trade deal in hand that icy tone had melted\nI have to certainly\nGive my highest regards to prime minister of Canada adjusted to do a lot of stories came out about adjusted and I\nHaving difficulty together we did over the trade deal\nIt's turned out to be a very very good deal for both and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\nSo how did Trudeau in Canada when such praise from the White House according to one report the answer is Canada's donut strategy and its trade talks with the U. S. former Trudeau advisor Roland Paris says the donut analogy as close but not quite there\nThe report that described it as another donut strategy suggested that the effort was to go around\nThe White House and to build a relationship with people in Congress with state governors with\nMayor is with you know people at all levels of the political system and with American industry the reason the metaphor is wrong is that it's more like a a Danish that do not because the whole ... as well as you are because part of the strategy was to build strong links with the administration the White House itself and that that did take place\nRight so maybe a ... yeah there you go whatever it's called ... you said at all levels of the U.S political system that included public and private who was enlisted in this project on the Canadian side\nWhile I was quite extraordinary on the Canadian side and there was a degree of unity on the Canadian effort that we haven't seen before that reflected the sense of threat to our economic interests but on the Canadian side most obviously you had provincial premier mayors of city you had a group of advisors pulled together\nFrom different political parties and I kind of extraordinary display of solidarity among uh parties that are normally sniffing at each other\nSo this project even enlisted a former conservative prime minister Brian ... you know\nWell on this from Romney of course was prime minister when the first candidate us free trade agreement was negotiated in the late Nineteen eighties so he had a particular interest in this issue but he also happens to live to have a place in uh Florida very near Wilbur Ross and he has a relationship with Donald Trump\nAnd so uh he was one of the people that the current Canadian government reached out to and uh as I said he represented a different party than they than Mr Trudeau party\nYeah do you know any specific details about the actual kind of access that a primal Ronnie got because he has this social circuit in Florida with the Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump\nHe was at mar a Lago one evening and uh was brought up and actually sang a song has he been down to do in the past I'm a chatted with Donald Trump who is president but you know other conversations were of course private\nSo a former prime minister from candidate whose conservative going to bat for current prime minister who's liberal how rare is that sort of bipartisanship and Canada\nIt's pretty unusual now bear in mind that Mr ... had a particular interest in trying to salvage NAFTA since he was a part of negotiating the first place but\nIt's hard to overstate the extent to which Donald Trump attitude towards NAFTA and towards Canada in general has galvanized Canadian you know this is a core economic interest for Canada Seventy five percent of our exports go to the United states it's about a fifth of our entire GDP this is the one truly existential\nInterest in our foreign policy and I've seen a level of unity in the political class\nWhich has frayed a little bit in the last few months but certainly across the country and support for the prime minister's effort that I haven't seen before\n[noise] Canada didn't do this when Obama or Bush were president ... why did they feel and had to do this now with Trump not just play the face to face with the Trump team but also triangulate around him to get this new NAFTA sorted\n[noise] well the reason for this was quite simple that our\nCore economic interests were at stake that even just the auto sector alone there are a hundred thousand jobs and in many many many more jobs that are dependent on that and the idea of a twenty five percent tariff on a Canadian autos go in the United states that sharpens the mind\nBut I Do want to emphasize one thing which is we're talking as though that this thing is over\nFrom the Canadian perspective this is an ongoing challenge we're dealing with the U.S president whose material and unpredictable there are remaining issues to be resolved including these steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place\nIsn't it an Dave Guard if if Trump tries to withdraw from the deal no\nDeal seems to be the deal at this point and it's a matter of passing through our respective ratification process but the steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place and we're not listed as a result of the deal and are part of the deal and those were main important to Canada and\nAlthough one would hope that this will set up ... or a more positive relationship\nBetween Canada the United states and Mexico\nWe can't afford not to take precautions and anything can happen as we've seen with this president and part of taking precautions saying this campaign is going to continue indefinitely\nRow in terms of the former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thanks very much for your time thanks Marco\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada brings more certainty to the U.S economy that's a good thing but here's something else to worry about new estimates from the congressional budget office show that our government's borrowing is off the charts by historical peacetime standards\nAccording to the c._e._o. and just a few years we'll be spending more money to pay the interest on our national debt and we will spend on our defense or Medicare\nTo put it another way the U.S has become one of the most indebted nations on earth\nWe asked the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what's that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a crisis right in front of us and what brings down in great empires past and future in debt and they're doing nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS when he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much double the dead since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price we have to suck ... debt down\nBut once Obama was out and Trump was in\n... Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget today the U.S debt sits at Twenty one trillion dollars a huge scary figure\nBut also kind of meaningless by itself\nWe're threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only advanced economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason firmin at Harvard's Kennedy School of government steady what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates\nAll the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia their old carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally the U.S is sandwiched between ... and Jamaica", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "02"}
