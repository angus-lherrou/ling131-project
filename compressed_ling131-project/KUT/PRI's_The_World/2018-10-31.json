GBH here in Boston\nUs troops are taking part in too big military operations right now one is faithful patriot involving five thousand plus American troops being deployed to the U.S Mexico border\nI spoke with retired General Stanley McChrystal today who told me what he thinks that operation says about America's leadership these days that's just the head first to a far larger operation now underway in northern Europe it's called Tritan juncture [noise]\nDryden juncture involve some fifty thousand personnel from twenty nine countries it's the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War the main part of the exercise is in Norway reporter Charles Maynes is there in ... so you've been\nWith the troops as we Charles ... what have you seen in who've you talked to\nYesterday they had a big media day event this was kind of a big ... amphibious assault they brought in air power um all simulating this attack\nAgainst a NATO ally in this case Norway or which triggered article five according to this is the collective defense and this was designed to show the article five still matters today the stage with Norway here as a sacrificial lamb\nWhat was the mood among the troops who spoke with well\nEveryone seemed to be pretty much enjoying themselves a lot of these guys certain from the United states or they were coming from used mostly the southeastern United States and North Carolina Florida and for them I think of course one of the big ... a kind of stunning aspects of this whole thing is being up\nIn a normal way of course in northern climate in fact I had a chance to talk to a lieutenant Louis and the shape of the United States Marine corps or he was one of the rare ones in fact he actually had some experience with this beforehand having taken a cold weather course with Norwegians but he had this bit of advice for his fellow Marines\nI spent a month era and being in a year learning from them and I think that someone who isn't as prepared for the cold can learn a few things from the ... or typical countries that we're going to have a varmint\nCharles for you how cold is it [noise]\nWell actually today was a little bit warm but very wet it's hovering around zero depending on the wind chill and things like that and give it a little bit more brutal but you know these guys you talk to you today and we were out with Marines walking around a bit um they all say that the weather's just kind of shifted back and forth the unpredictable weather in Norway as usual for this time of year\nSo let's talk about what this whole NATO exercise tried and juncture actually means who's taking part in this well\nThis is a members of old twenty nine NATO allies all twenty nine NATO countries plus partners in Finland and Sweden I'm as you noted in your intro it's it's a massive exercise with fifty thousand personnel are about sixty five ships taking part a hundred that the aircraft or ten thousand vehicles so just massive exercise\nBut in terms of who they are actually directed at well NATO seems to stress that this is all a fictitious enemy and of course so this the last I had a chance to talk with Admiral James logo he's commander of the joint force commanded Naples, Italy was leading the U.S team up here in Norway\nWe don't pick any particular individual names using the exercise ... fishes or we're not interested and I'm picking anybody else territory it why is that the defense of operation started during a sovereignty or the borders of those member nations to twenty nine\nCharles I mean given Donald Trump's criticism of NATO I'm it it is perhaps this exercise a reminder to the president of the United states about article five and his responsibilities\n[noise] yeah I think that's one of the stories you're behind the scenes as concern over just the U. S. is commitment and this in some ways where the reassurance you heard again and again for people from a NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg\nTo the U.S ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison saying that you know the NATO alliance as strong as ever um\nIt was interesting to hear also Mr Stoltenberg talked about how again these exercises were not targeted against anyone uh but at the same breath you say you know we're facing the most challenging security environment in a generation and and this brings us back to you know the reality today no one doubts that this is a message to Russia\nFrom states that border Russia such as Norway and the Baltic states you know what really increasingly worried about what they see as aggressive behavior particularly after the annexation of Crimea Russia's proxy war in Ukraine and this is really a sense that said that you know article five matters and I think that it matters to the Trump Administration\nReporter Charles Maynes and ... Norway thank you thank you Mark I'm\nRetired General Stanley McChrystal knows a thing or two about war he spent most of his career in special operations and it was also commander of U.S forces in Afghanistan now McChrystal's reconsidering the notion of leadership in a new book it profiles Thirteen leaders from wildly different backgrounds\nBut they had in common was this white hot burning conviction in their cause\nOne of the leaders McChrystal profiled as someone he calls a valid Musab al Zarqawi the former head of ... in Iraq\nOne point he had a razor blade smuggled into the prison and they cut us off a cat too that he put it on in his youth because it is a violation of Islam and the other inmates you're able to see that and here's a guy who proves\nThat he's willing to walk the walk all the time and then later as he leads al Qaeda in Iraq it's the same thing it's not the brilliance of his ideas are strategy it just absolute conviction that makes us attracted us his followers people attracted to someone who's so jealous\nSo charisma and passion key for leadership are zealots the good leaders and where does charisma impassioned start to turn into zealotry\nWell it's interesting charisma and passion or usually good and we as followers are attracted to them but just like they can take us to the wrong place and what we found with ... she's like a flame that burns so hot than it burns the oxygen in a room\nIn the case of Zarqawi we killed him but he was necessarily going to die because he was burning too hot for the environment which he was even the Iraqis who followed him didn't share the same level of commitment he did so\nBy the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind maybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to most of all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you\nAre also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began is that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or lack of success some policy if we're talking Afghanistan and particularly well\nYou had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an new story came at our a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "31"}
