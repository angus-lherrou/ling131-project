I talk about how as a as an advice columnist\nUm we have these basic assumptions about millennials that they're spoiled and entitled an over confident in their abilities um and that their digital natives and they just use um their devices and it it you know so easily and it's not it doesn't the they don't feel self conscious they feel great\nOn social media is natural to them they don't mind taking selfies and posting them constantly that you know this is their natural world um and also that they're lazy and they're you know awkward and that they can't get it together and why can't they do better jobs they won't can't be led\n'em but you know from the letters that I read um that's not what I see I actually see millennials with the same kinds of anxieties um and the same sorts\nOf struggles that we have ... and that we that are boomers had another all generations at 'em and you know the letters the letters that I get really a lot of people describe I'm wanting to be a better version of themselves and not being able to get there um\nAnd you know they they they feel like they're constantly comparing themselves to others on line and it looks to them like everyone else is doing fine and moving forward and plowing forward and that they're the only ones who kind of a sabotage themselves repeatedly um but I remember feeling that way\nUm throughout my twenties just that I was always in my own way um I think it's a natural feeling that you're the only one you know even when someone says you're destined for great things\nUm you think but I Am not that's not possible for me because I Will find a way to mess it up and I hate myself from getting their um which is you know goes back to the grace of all time kind of thinking it's like\nWhy why why wouldn't I if once you recognize that everyone is kind of in the same boat um and it becomes apparent once you talk to people\nUm then then it's you know you can actually tune in to the people and their truth and tune out of the messages that you're getting day after day and I mean it takes constant vigilance though\nUm suffer millennials I think it's ... yeah I think it's a million times harder a million times harder actually because they were they've you know they grew up in the middle of this and sometimes they don't know\nWhere they and and social media begins it's it's really it's really fluid and and crazy and invasive\nUm and so a lot of what I talk about in my column is you know it really just boils down to the idea that there is no better version of yourself waiting in the future you know you have to work with what you have\nRight now and and also the quality the the the joy of hard work um it's something that we don't you know it's not emphasize that much our culture either we feel like we have to get places fast you know get their quickly um you're on your way go\nAh but the joy of actually slowly patiently working towards something that you that you care about um is it is kind of a a joy that we've lost and it's something that I really had to re learn myself when I realized how much I Love writing every day\nUm and I wasn't tuning into that I mean I ... I didn't experience is loving writing I was just like I'm just getting things done and crossing things off my list but then I started to notice actually love writing and so noticing how much you love the ... work the work you do\nNoticing who your humanity essentially and your connection to what you do have there have been why don't they don't have that connection you want to look for it you know\nHow they're ever left he writes the ask Polly column for New York magazine and this author of a book of essays called what if this were enough Heather it's been a pleasure thanks so much for making time for us today\nThank you Chris I had so much fun talking to you thank you for having me you can follow us on Twitter at K.

system\nWell the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by\nGuessing ... in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds the bottom line they found that an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security and mine's\nExperts hope the test will be a wakeup call these one point six six trillion dollars worth of American weapons are worth nothing if they can be shut down because of a bad password whoa that's our top story today on the world [noise]\nYes well nothing that I have seen has happened yet out of Congress but but this jail report was produced at the behest of the Senate and the Senate Armed forces committee so they are on it and they will presumably be reading this report and find it very interesting before they agree\nTo give the D D the money that the DOT wants to to develop these weapons\nThis problem clearly goes back at least to the Obama administration how come this didn't get attention earlier\nI don't think this is a partisan issue it's a it's an issue of the government uh not not and and and you know not just US government\nGovernments around the world not necessarily recognizing\nHow big a deal cyber security\nReally is you know we we've been operating government's been operating on sort of a Cold War paradigm\nFor a really long time when it comes to military

thousands of people are still missing two weeks after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit some of the way the island at least two thousand people died in many more were displaced and getting water food and medical supplies to affected areas is still a big challenge\nSo what the Indonesian government announced this week may come as a surprise you said that only Indonesian aid workers can help out in the hardest hit areas foreign aid workers have to get approval from the government first and work with local groups\nPolicy has people like ... ... worried she's with the Jakarta office of Catholic Relief services\nI feel like my hands are tied I tied up because agency like the IRS and we have limited number of stuff because you know uh some time to program in the country it's quite big sometimes you know quite small [noise] so the shoe box on international I started really accelerates a speed up\nOur capacity to respond\nWe're going to take a step back now and check in with Jonathan Katz he was a pie reporter and twenty ten when a huge earthquake hit Haiti he later wrote a book some titled how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster we wanted to get his take on the response to the current crisis in Indonesia\nTo get us started Johnson why would Indonesian not want the services a foreign aid workers at the time like this it seems counter intuitive\nYeah I mean if you follow foreign aid a law that actually makes a lot more sense there's\nBeen a lot of talk about the need to have countries leave their own recovery and try to cut down on basically foreigners coming in and invading and and taking over everything themselves\nThen the government is kind of doing what people would have been hoping the national government should do but of course it sometimes shakes out a little differently on the ground when your group is the one who's being told to stand on\nYeah I mean we we were talking to someone from Catholic Relief services and her concern and others is that\nIt's great to have a nation to itself but particularly in these early days when you're trying to rescue people you're you're trying to give immediate support aren't you missing an opportunity to have people with the right skills in quickly to help\nSome of these things actually don't work the way the people who are sitting outside of the disaster zone imagine but they might search and rescue is actually a really good example um eighties of course the example I Know that because I Lived through it about the disaster where between a hundred thousand three hundred and sixteen thousand people were killed\nThere were something on the order of about three million people who were in the disaster zone and the highest number of that I was ever able to find for the number of Haitians were rescued by those international rescuers was two hundred and eleven\nAnd a lot of the estimates are lower than that the vast majority of people thousands and thousands of people were rescued by their friends or neighbors other people who are around and in Indonesia which is a country that has stronger institutions in Haiti does\nIt would make sense that Indonesia rescuers will probably already there and already better position to do some of those rescues to refuse actually maybe one of the better examples of a place where foreigners are not as useful also too much\nIn what cases are foreigners more useful\nSo obviously the the system is a mess in the disaster response system internationally is kind of a disaster and so it was really interesting example if you were told me\nIt's like a blind item that there is a country if it was trying to crack down on or regulate foreigners after a recent disaster I'm going to give you like to get I think in the news will probably would have been one of the to the reason for that because back in two thousand war you remember the the guy that I was just\nAbout to ask you about that 'cause I wondered if the same policy was in place then\nYeah I mean it was a slightly different set up by what happened and that was really interesting was Indonesia really tried to take over the response itself part of what happened was the initial response was a bit chaotic\nUm it's one of the things that the Indonesian government at the time was\nThey set up a a reconstruction rehabilitation commission and it really became a model for much of the rest of the world on how a national government can take over an aid effort force outside NGOs aid groups to register with them\nAnd direct resources where they need to be taking money in themselves and govern how that money goes back out\nAnd it certainly wasn't perfect but it was widely praised effort\nIt's interesting to hear you because when you're sitting in\nYou know here place like Boston or New York or anywhere in the U. S. and you're hearing about some massive disaster in some faraway country that you don't know a lot about what you think might be kind of poor the emotional response is sort of well wait you know wait you're ... you're not treating your people well and and\nThat's not right I mean how do you counter that feeling that somehow that people are being short changed\nI Know where people are coming from I feel the same way but what I learned when I was living through these disasters and especially the experience in Haiti is that to be perfectly honest it's not about and it's much more important\nThat people who actually live in these places where the survivors themselves\nWho's society cultures are are taking the lead in their own rescue and their own recovery\nAnd people are kind of scrambling and part of the scrambling is trying to figure out who's in charge and who has the power and that's something that that people who aren't experience with disaster might think is is kind of crafts or beside the point is something that should be dealt with later but we see and disaster after disaster that you have to deal with it right at the very beginning\nMy last question is\nYou know you wrote a whole book about the whole Haiti experience and and the role of foreign aid what were your biggest takeaways from that experience what are the lessons learned and to what degree are they being applied now\nI think the biggest thing is that I think there was a sense from a lot of people in the world that Haitians were bystanders in their own disaster\nAnd actually being there and seeing the way that people came together and then ultimately took charge of their own rebuilding in their own reconstruction really showed me\nThe way in which that completely backwards the best thing that foreigners can do is just people in their own effort and they kind of get out of the way and I think one of the most important things that we can do is respect that and try to help without making our own savior complex the big story\nJonathan Katz is the author of the big truck that went by how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster\nHe's currently a fellow at the New America foundation excellent Jonathan thank you [laughter]\n[noise]\nIn the world [noise]\nSupport comes from Austin development services department now homeowners can apply for building permits pay fees and schedule inspections on line and those with questions can use the live chat feature all that Austin, Texas dot Gov slash ABC\nSupport comes from Texas oncology with a reminder that October as breast cancer awareness month to eight early detection on winning over the age of forty should undergo routine screening like yearly mammograms Laurent Texas oncology dot com [noise] the market\nPlunges and President Trump signed the target to blame\nI think the fed is\nFar too stringent and then making a mistake and a staff writer said it's despite that we're doing very well\nI Know that change will talk to a former fed official about what the president's attacks\nMe for the institution this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] today four to six thirty right here and Katie\nIsraeli troops have killed six Palestinians during protests near the border with Gaza these ... there were killed off to building a home and the security fence and trying to attack an Israeli border post\nA prominent Bollywood to an director has two dogs of assume project after they were both accused of sexual harassment none of ... denies the accusations that said that pushing the movie house food food with the right thing to do\nSeveral countries accused of severe rights abuses have been in ... to ... to to the un human rights council\nHuman rights watch has especially criticized the uncontested selection of the Philippines and ...
