[noise]\nYou know when he said that you know what I was thinking about I was thinking about what what\nAre immigrant communities Latino immigrants Asian Americans what are we doing for black people right\nWhat is ... ... what what does that look like\nYou know and and I think part of the ambivalence that did that that the caller mentioned is because we haven't done enough I don't think the conversation has really started in the way that it should\nYou know as far as I'm concerned right we cannot talk about immigrant rights in this country and what it means to me and they were going to this country without talking to white people black people and Native Americans\nRight we cannot do that defined America and we have made a very conscious choice to be as intentional and as inclusive as we are when it comes to this conversation\nThis just think I'm ...

I'm Sorry what is so preference preferable\nShe said I guess the question is why stay here if it's kept you away from your mother for twenty five years [noise]\n[noise]\nI Am here because of what she decided to do\nI'm going to be really honest with you I resented my mom I think pretty much all of my teenage years until I was maybe twenty four twenty five I thought maybe she didn't want me I thought maybe you know she was starting a new family and she wanted she wanted to start clean and that maybe I was a burden right [noise]\n[noise] and then of course you've got all during realized that actually she did do ultimately sacrifice that any parent would have to do right\nShe would rather had given me up to make sure that I became someone better in a place where I could be better I don't know why that wasn't in the Philippines out ... I didn't know why it has to be here in the United states but that was her choice [noise]\nUm and do I want to go see her\nAs I Do I mean sometimes when people the trolls when they get specially ugly and hateful date they would send messages like gays should probably go back to the Philippines you for your mother dies well [noise]\n'cause you know I've sent a there's a lot of undocumented people to reach out to me and they send me to do the boat dose of the sky that they watch because their parents passed away and they watch the service through Skype because they can't leave\n[noise]\nSo [noise] I'm aware of all of that um [noise] I'm aware of what has been lost and twenty five years which is not something that I can fix in the next few minutes do we have left in this conversation\nIn many ways this book actually you know is dedicated to her she's the last person you here from the book I thought that was only appropriate [noise] at one point in the book I asked her if she had regretted doing what she did she regretted sending me here and she said um [noise]\nI look at you now I look at what you've become and how can I regret it\n[noise] and I didn't really has [noise] was it ... it was a phone conversation of course [noise] um I didn't really have a hard to tell her that I didn't know what I have become [noise] but whatever I have become because I don't think it's natural\nFor a kid to be separated\nFrom his or her mom I don't think that's natural [noise]\nSo whatever it is that had become I'm Still kind of trying to figure it out and I'm doing everything that I can to make that sacrifice worthy\nIt doesn't sound like you've completely come to terms with her decision\nNo not no and I was very kind of clear with that embezzling from the book is you know [noise] um and you know the other thing I thought about because I probably would not have written about her and this way if I hadn't been in a cell with those kids in South Texas right in McAllen [noise]\nAnd um [noise] the kids who are afraid to kind of yeah I Would you know ages five to search maybe and [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI Would just kind of look at them and I'm Wondering like they don't know what's happening and they probably have the same experience that I had which is I didn't remember the last thing my mom said to me the only thing I remembered what she said it might get cold there he was a jacket\n[laughter] so you know\nBut ... year where we should we share to sell their sheer now they have to make a life on their own they have to figure out why their parents did would have to do\nRight so I wanted to kind of speak to that embezzling\nTo speak to that kind of emotion that is again way beyond immigration reform or on a company might or whatever language we use\n[noise] but what I Do know is what those parents did and what my mother did this what generations of immigrants have done to this country and in this country since the beginning of time [noise]\n[noise] right I've been fascinated recently with Irish American history I didn't know that they called do you know dumb cockpit ships to so many people died when they got on those boats to come to America\nPotato famine you know like what did they say to Teach Like what do they say to each other [noise]\nJose Antonio Vargas is a journalist filmmaker and founder and CEO of the nonprofit to sign an American his memoir is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen well thank you so much for making time for me so much for having me [noise]\nYou can follow us on Facebook and Twitter are handled is at key are a think you can subscribe to the pod cast using your favorite podcast that there are a bunch of them out there and the thing on cast is available for free\nIf you want to find out what we have planned for upcoming shows go to think that ...

Vera almost died in ...\nThe one thing I'm thinking that they have other places we wouldn't be in\nAddress but it's just it's a different game really\nShe wiped out on her first wave and was dragged under the water\nAnd I had no no life jacket and I had a broken leg that was just a big fight\nMaya was up for that fight though five years later she returned to the same spot caught an enormous wave and wrote it all the way to a world record but first she had to convince skin is to create a new category for women's surfers on his first anniversary of me to that end other stories of unbreakable women today on the world\n\nBut from that moment on we haven't been facing the worst recession in our history and there is also widespread corruption probe that has implicated many of the leaders\nOf the major parties in Brazil so there is this feeling that we need this sweeping change that is going to solve all of our problems and ... an idle he has been very good capitalize on that\n[noise] so as we mark this one year anniversary of me too I guess we should point out the Brazilian women already had been fighting back against sexual harassment and and violence or for years\nSo for the left leaning demonstrators that the march you went to last weekend do you think the me too movement was kind of redundant for some of them\nI don't think so because the me too movement has\nActually brought men accused of sexual harassment and sexual abuse before authority and that doesn't happen in Brazil the me too movement doesn't inspire women here and it's another important for us at play\nReporter Julia of unity in Sao paolo thank you very much thank you mark ... here's a different take on the me too movement from a place halfway across the globe from Brazil\n\n\nThat's Ali Khamenei the Supreme leader of Iran you speaking there and a slick we've produced video that was posted on his official Twitter feed ... republics response of sorts to me to\nCome and he says that in the west women one after another have been subjected to abuse harassment or violence the ends by saying but in Islam there isn't this kind of problem because women wear had jobs\nIn\n\nThe mirror more you're deemed joins me from Toronto\n... you're Iranian Canadian or what did you make of this video\nI don't ... going to be some weird but I was really jazzed by it because I'm the Islamic republic of Iran will often do this they'll take 'em moments that are happening specifically in America\nThey'll use it to their own advantage to sort of\nPlay games of ... and they and you know polemic le show how they are much better how their society functions better and how the US's prayed than deprived the language that even years in this video by the harmony is something that's really to be focused on because he says\nBy introducing head job Islam shut the door on a path\nThat pulls women towards\nThat deviation so the word that he uses is introducing had jumped I mean his job was not\nIntroduce it was violently put on women's heads in Iran and it still to this day is a violently put on women's heads anyone it's compulsory it's not a choice this video for me it was very much also a response to the mass\nMovement that's happening in the country against\nCompulsory baling of women harmony is trying to touch on all of these nerves and saying to him and if you don't learn this year will be sexually assaulted but then at the same time this is a choice for you when it's not\nIt sounds very multi layered and somewhat complex ... you said you were just by this video where you jazz or this video as a journalist or because it's fascinating I Can't imagine your job you know as a woman\nYeah no the woman I was not as a woman I thought it was hypocritical I thought it was vile but as a journalist ah I've always been very enthralled by it piqued my interest when I look at the propaganda used by the Islamic republic even the video itself the music the images our own Canadian Parliament is\nImplicated in this video there's images of our parliament there's images of the European Union so I always find the the propaganda of the Islamic republic very interesting and for anybody who's ever been to the country it's so pervasive and in your face\nIt kind of feels like the message here in this video is that Iran doesn't need the me too movement 'cause these me two problems don't exist in Iran I suspect don't agree with that\nI mean I I don't at all it's absurd to say um that had job protects you from harassment are the only thing had job like protect you from his son um\nAs a woman who's who's walk the streets of Tehran many times and been harassed a it's absurd to make that notion I mean harassment of women violence of living happens all over the world it doesn't matter what you're wearing\nYou know and women in Iran has been using the meat to hash tag this is a conversation that came up right when that the Harvey Weinstein story broke\nWomen in Iran where using that hashtags to talk about their own instances of harassment and violence and sexual assault\nAnd actually it wasn't just women in Iran it was also men who we are talking about being abused and using that hashtags in the country so highly harmony is is really trying to push against this but the people in the country are using that hashed tank\nYou see this kind of stepping back too\nThe movement in Iran to get rid of the job\nOh absolutely they use some of the head job by the state it's not just a piece of cloth I mean there are women in Iran who wear it by choice and they are religious women but there are women who are forced to put this on and all over the country there are billboards you know five six ten feet tall\nKelly lemon that quote you are in all Easter you're like an oyster shell and the head job it is now\nWhat about women who are proud to embrace our Muslim faith and proud to where the job or have you had conversations with some of those women about sexual assault and to me to campaign\nThose are women who have also put out hashtags insane meet you so that's where the hypocrisy lines right I mean women don't necessarily who are Muslim don't necessarily where they had job to protect themselves from men\nYou know what I mean at the end of the day when you when you talk about had job in the way that harmony talks about it in the way that the state in Iran talks about it who are we needing protection from so why not target men in their behavior rather than getting women\nRunning a Canadian journalist ... speaking with us from Toronto

G. flash Ewing Dr McGregor and his colleagues have helped these girls and women in Congo kill and go on with their laws\nThis is a glorious day for the women of Congo and for every sexual survivor in the world but particularly women who have suffered with really tremendous world in difference in conflict zones\nEvents were as an activist and playwright best known for The Vagina monologues she worked with Dr McGregor for more than a decade the to help create city of joy an organization for survivors of violence on the Democratic Republic of Congo and just a reminder here we're talking about sexual violence and it may be difficult to listen to what's coming up\nAnd told me she spoke with Dr McGregor today after the Nobel announcement\nHe called me this morning first thing and I can hear all of our sisters dancing and singing behind him oh I think this day is an incredible day um you know it's kind of odd to be here in the United states where we're seeing\nThe kind of rise of in unity and an accountability of sexual survivors at the same moment that Dr ... has won the norm now do these five with not in law\nThat survivor terrible sexual violence and war but I think it's a victory because I think what Dr ... has always stood for\nAs a man as a doctor as a human being he's given his life devoted his life to ending raped as a tactical war just shopping this couch of sexual violence and it's really cool to all men to follow his example\nHow did you first meet Dr ...\nIn two thousand and six I was invited by the un to interview Dr ... and then I met him and interviewed him at night I remember that first interview his eyes were literally blood shot\nFrom all the pain and atrocities he was witnessing and\nAt the time after the interview he asked me if I were to come to Colorado\nTo support his efforts and to help him get the world word out to the world about what was going on there because no one was paying attention so in two thousand and eight I went to the Congo Janine him and I spent weeks they're interviewing are listening to women and to their stories and to be honest I was shatter\nA shattered and I think those week\nThere I knew that it ...\nOur moon than our were white moving to commit ourselves a completely on forever to what was going on in the Congo we would see the spread of that kind of violence in armed conflict and in wars and so that began are working and profound relationship with Dr ... which is going on for twelve years ...\nEvents where you've been to a lot of places around the world where you witness violence against women Ciudad Juarez Mexico or Afghanistan where women were and still are oppressed by the Taliban um have you ever met a man like a duck to Dennis ... of prior to your trip to Congo\nI haven't met one prior and I have my own sense\nI mean I I really do believe he's almost like I'm new at the man who um are you know he's a man of enormous grade even that he ... he comes from a pastor\nAnd he's also fears and they also relentless I mean I remember sitting with him when he wants to talk to me about\nHow he can't sleep at night imagining what would happen if\nThey came to take his daughters and other stories a woman after woman after woman the desecration of their bodies just blend in better than they are being and this has rallies him\nTo understand that if women are destroyed if their bodies are destroyed their beings and futures are destroyed we had no future as humanity\nIs there one story you can share about Dr ... and how we intervened and changed a woman's believe that she was ruined forever better life was over\n[noise] well I remember on at the beginning of a city of joy the sanctuary and revolutionary center in the ... where women transform their pain to power and that was a young woman who was standing talking about what she had been through and he said to her um\nYou know when we're when you're inside your mother's or you don't know what your future will be and this change the way this place will be like that for you when you enter here\nYou will be able to go through a process where you transform what is going inside you and you will come out of that first a new one and the woman just began to wheat and she can almost taste that future and I think I have witnessed Dr ... for example he gets Crawford as the of joy\nYou does sex ed classes where he teaches women on not only to know their to China's and to know how they would join his work but to protect their giants but he actually asked\nThem to draw their vagina is so they are not afraid of them and so they know their bodies and so they aren't embarrassed by their bodies so they're not and shame that terrible things are not allowed to happen in the dark he is so brave and and I have to say in space so much\nCriticism and ostracism and and and attack for really raking with tradition and breaking with patriarchy and breaking with those values that suppress women", "show_name": "PRI's The
