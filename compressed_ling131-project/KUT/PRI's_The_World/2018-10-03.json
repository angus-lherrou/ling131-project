take care of yourself\n[noise] well to be honest you weren't can't accurately and to be honest I didn't really think about it in the beginning um I knew that China had a blood borne a crisis I knew that it had something to do with class not um but I was also I think a tiny bit in denial\nOn and I thought well I'll never get sick right when I'm there and I did almost immediately\nSo in the beginning it kind of started out as well I can get it in the U.S because I have health insurance there that will cover it my insurance and China might not cover it and then I started digging into more\nThe story of what had happened in China's plasma banks and then I knew right away that there was no chance that I could ever use Chinese made plasma products\nIf it was so dangerous in China in terms of blood why did you go\n[laughter]\nBecause it's a good question and I don't know I mean I was extremely interested in China as journalists [noise] um I also think there was a part of me that wanted to explore the story because it was a story that was part of my life um but it was also so I I Believe\nThat time it was so completely different in my own experience in the U.S until I found it intriguing and I found\nIt's interesting that China at that time was a place where I could kind of create my own medical bubble where I can bring this up then I can bring it in a hospital and they would infuse it for me but I I mean I Would say starting right away I started every ...\nDifferent elements of the story about the AIDS crisis and health care in China\nHome to drugs and counterfeit drives and it's all tied together\nAnd so sensitive story or to the Chinese government any way that you're only telling it fully now\nSo give us a little bit of background on China's blood scandal um it it's got some similarities with the blood scandal in the u._k. we just reported on so it's the early nineties China's opening up pretty fast the capitalism and blood especially for poor country

looked around for what was the most is on debt natural resource and in ... and that just happens to be people it with less populated province in China and also one of the poorest\nSo someone and we still don't really know who got this idea that they could create what they called a plasma economy where they were paying farmers who never got paid for anything farmers had nominal income and with no sleep subsistence living for farmers where they could pay them a small amount for their\nBlood and blood plasma and that everyone would get rich and the process now a lot of farmers did get rich but

in Beijing that HIV was innocent people were getting infected\nAnd in spite of law that it took three months to officially shut down the system so there was this\nPeriod any kind of argue about what the government knew when that there is this period of three months before the government closed down all the officially sanctioned plasma stations in ... where\nThey absolutely knew what was happening and let it continue so it's a\nYeah it's that's what happened in the u._k. and we had our own problems in the U.S I mean there have associated with that yeah there have been tainted blood scandal all around the world um and it's\nIt's kinda revealing look at how governments respond when these things do happen in China's response is there to shut it down and cover it up quickly and take it went in
