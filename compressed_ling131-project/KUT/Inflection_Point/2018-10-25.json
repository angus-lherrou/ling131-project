{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Yes politifact writer Samantha pot Herman confirmed of in researching this fact check that Culberson chairs a subcommittee that signed off on speeding up spending on that telescope it's being built in ... a little detail when it's completed about five years from now or it will map the sky every three days and log anything that changes are disappears\nOkay I'm of course what what's being said here suggests that by saying yes for this telescope that takes away money from dams and flood control right\nAnd this instance math I found it did not end of the telescope funding was in one appropriations measure of going through Congress ... money for dams and flood prevention was restricted to another appropriations Africa Congress has about a dozen of these every every who you're\nSure you're okay so uh what about fixing dams what vote did Culberson make when it came to that\nHe absolutely records show voted against the damn rehabilitation repair act of two thousand seven well\nI mean it sounds like there you go right in\nThe accept hold on Samantha found that that act authorized two hundred and one million dollars for FEMA grants to fix this is important non federally owned dams significantly none of that could have gone to the to dams that\nThat were were critical to protecting Houston last you remember this because in those dams or federally owned oh okay okay you're talking about the addicts and Barker dams here that's where we all remember well from Hurricane Harvey okay so lectures other apps claim had to do with ... percent voting against flood protection for prevention right mhm in\nTwenty Thirteen ... voted against a Democrats what turned out to be failed motion that would have added up to twenty five million dollars to funds appropriate to support FEMA activities including another breath here mhm pre disaster mitigation grants ... covers his campaign told politifact\nThe ... had to do with first responders training not funding to eight homeowners ore to shore up the structure okay notably to cobra soon voted for the final version of that proposal\nOh what what about the what Chris we're spending was in that I'm a version\nAccording to the story it directs FEMA to manage to provide funds to address any major disaster in the future and also increased funding for females here's another mouth full the national pre disaster mitigation fun\nI Want to make sure I heard this right it did it increased funding for fame as a pre disaster mitigation that's right okay so you put all this together how does lectures claimed fare on the politifact Texas truth o meter\nBut it altogether it landed the rating of mostly false [noise]\nAnd that means editor saw an element of truth remember that telescope it did get fast tracked Monday Night but none of that money could have been peeled off to focus on flood prevention in Houston area or elsewhere and the other folks about ... and not supporting damn are pairs of ... flood funding\nAnti flood funding you could say didn't fully are you ready for this yes didn't fully hold water oh All right [laughter]\nThat's obviously gardeners Elvie folks he he's here on behalf of the fact checking politifact Texas project which is based at the Austin American statesman thanks so much for coming in could be All right well see you next week\n[noise]\nAnd you are listening to the Texas standards [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell done bars monitoring social media were all monitoring the story of a several bombs being reported that various sites including the time Warner center there ... and then does its operations out of New York city\nYeah yeah really surreal scene on the TV is outside of the studios David because the CNN anchor for broadcasting from the street or next to their evacuating bill evacuated building so uh the suspected moms into CNN also sent to the Clintons the Obamas a democratic back or George Soros or\nCNN are plenty of up to the suspicious package it received was addressed a former CIA director John Brennan prominent critic on cable news\nWho uh pointedly had his security clearance revoked by the president also seeing a as well David that the Florida offices of representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz the former head of the Democratic national convention or ... or I Would act you waited ... committee yes\nAh her office evacuated as well or having received aid says they oughta package don't know if it's a you know got the same signatures or anything like that obviously this is a developing story lots of\nInformation flying around out there lots of people question I have a role Republican rhetoric is played in these attempted attacks we heard from some folks sounding off about that earlier or another really disturbing aspect of all this is the sheer number of people on social media who say they simply don't believe it that this is some\nConspiracy drummed up to garner sympathy and make Republicans look bad here ... yeah here's one example of that from Houston for one Jeff people see tweets that this is an obvious false flag\nMolested was attacking people enforcing mob behavior all over the country and they were losing on it so now this false flag to pretend that the right in this country as as as violent as the left it isn't\nA so again you know I'm an example of this sort of rhetoric that you do see out there and you know information is just so\nA polarized ah you know obviously you can't enforce any of this ah from the election\nAnd uh you know that's not to say you and I think it's important to say that you know at some point this transcends ideology the mindset of a person who is willing to do this and you know even the most rabid partisan simply just doesn't do something like this but still you questioned the role of the rhetoric that's out there\nUh knowing that there are people out there who could be disturbed that would do such a thing\nYou know it it it and it's a commentary I suppose on how social media sort of amplifies yeah a lot of these stories and and and in some cases\nUh uh for the worse I mean for example there was that story that came out that CNN and other news media outlets have picked up on its not clear that social media ah was responsible for the story that the White House had had received a pipe bomb or a threat\nBut in fact a Reuters found out that that was not the case and and once again a ...\nWell ... you know something that you were just talking about here with politicians sort of\nSaying well there are politicians coming out right now on both sides of the aisle are condemning all of this so Senator Orrin hatch of Utah was being quoted as saying that these sorts of threats have been around through a number of presidencies and uh uh but he's saying that uh we have to make sure that in his words the good people on both sides really run but\nAnd ... yeah oh yeah so crews on with the statement as well [noise] you know there's that music for obviously wrap things up but we should probably mention we're going to be on that we're going to be on the ...\nThat's right absolutely we are going to be out in San Antonio I'm looking forward to\nReconnecting with all of our friends at Texas Public radio and I always used to talk\nOf recommendation anyone's listening have breakfast tacos especially down there the Alamo city we hope\nYou can join us for a very special edition of the Texas standard broadcasting live from San Antonio tomorrow Sylvia and I'm David Brown alone was well done bar and the rest of the crew here wish you a wonderful west\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\nJoyce [laughter] think David ...

D. one Austin\nThe corporation for public broadcasting was born to almost two years ago as a part of the public broadcasting active Nineteen sixty seven today it provides seed money with strings attached\nFor the fourteen hundred public radio and television stations across the country [noise] CPB dollars must be spent on local and national programming in community outreach this fiscal year KU team receive about five percent of its funding\nFrom the CPB there's always a certain amount of political discussion on whether or not to continue federal funding for public broadcasting but what it really comes down to ... the most dependable and ... double source of funding for K. U. T. is now and always will\nBe from people just like you [noise] keep public media in central Texas strong [noise] it's important that listeners who depend on K. U. T. contribute your investment today is the best way to ensure the future for the kinds of smart journalism you depend on\nEvery day from K. U.

[noise]\nTwenty Seventeen was that a banner year for activism the largest map level of the nation in modern history of the world that was the beginning of two thousand [noise] we end the two thousand and Seventeen with a large number of the nation\nOn line men are scared out of their minds women are now here too they're like oh what does this mean how do we move forward\nI there's a lot of conflict well we can start by looking back I learned Schiller and on today's infection plainly get behind the scenes in the women's march after the election of Donald ... day last fall\nAnd boom boom boom boom boom boom [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere\n[noise] and when the Nazis in invaded Denmark the story goes that it was my great grandfather's idea for the king to wear a star and to tell the police force where a Jewish dark\nAnd then what ended up happening is most of the population put on a Jewish star and it was impossible for them to tell you\nOkay so to gather\nPowell and Sarah Sophie brought in all these artists to create art work for the women's march created the why I marched videos and in celebration of the one year anniversary of the women's march\nThey've published a book called together we rise\nAnd it documents the scenes behind the women's march\nDuring and after it's to the question of [noise]\nAnd it's out right now\nWe got together while I was in New York recently to talk about the power of art and culture in to the button [noise]\nHow ... and Sarah Sophie like many of\nThink of their lives as before\nAnd after the election of Donald Trump\nHere's what ... told me [noise]\nBefore Donald Trump was elected I\nWas the writer director filmmaker\nWorking in the narrative films as well as documentary and most of my ... with immigration I'm undocumented specifically immigration\nDonald Trump since the world exploded after Donald Trump personally anyways um I started working and volunteering at the women's march though the national organizer for the women's march in the artistic director of the women's march and in the year\nSince the women's march has happened I continue to work there um continue to do our cultural activism stuff as well as films but not that much anymore and ...\nBefore the election for a while now I've been working in the cultural political space and sort of merging the two so that's everything from a political theater group called the citizens and then in the creative director and I do trapeze with\nAnd uh I I worked previously with or not war making you know cultural campaigns for organizations like emily's list we worked for tangentially with the Clinton campaign and\nThings of that nature and um since uh I'd say you know five days after the election I have been a national organizer the women's march and\nUm the great love story of the women's marches up how to learn I found each other and and now we get to make all this incredible work together\nSo I'm ...\nI I Need to hear about how you became a trapeze artist\n[laughter] I don't worry are are\nHas not included the show and I don't know why you keep doing it because I don't know the idea of\nI have a story about that so I I just was a a pretty serious dancer until I joined Fifteen and then I just wanted to find a way to segue\nYou know the dance that my body knows into something that I could perform and I met this incredible woman Chelsea bacon who is a historically amazing ... area west and um she just started teaching me and then we started the citizens band together like six months later so I've been performing\nNot that well since you know the beginning of my career um so\nI guess maybe like three or four months after the election of like a month or so after the women's march my husband is walking shoes are seven year old and they saw some circus thing in my seven year old said oh mommy would've loved that if Hillary Clinton had won the election\nAnd um my husband told me that and I was like I'm not gonna let these\nCars steal my joy and I was so grateful that you know he had that my seven year old had that insight\nBecause then I ended up performing and you know there there's the part of his we we can't normalize and like I Want to talk about that 'cause it's so important but also like you have to keep your life normal\nAnd I think it's extremely important yes probably lead it's extremely important to 'em in the keeping of your life normal also realize that because we are resisting and it's every day something then when something crazy and things we never imagine or possible are now happening I'm In a bad way a\nThan we do get tired and it's okay to get tired um because the states and that gets hired as just impossible a but in that when you're tired\nYou need to be able to rest and what is that thing that allows you to rest as meditation is dancing is it being the trapeze artist is it singing and then in that resting\nYou get more strength and ultimately you knew you focus on what is the thing that is pushing you to organize to resist and and at the end I think this is what I say all the time no matter what it is\nIs that the centers love to eat it might be an issue but\nIt's love for that issue so for me it's the immigrant community right so I Am an immigrant though I'm not an undocumented immigrant I've been in the space for eight years and when I'm at my darkest place when I Want to give up when the dream act\nThat was supposed to be passed as not being passed what is the thing that gets me out of bed it's my love for the immigrant community it is my love for those that are undocumented because of their getting up and fighting everyday then how\nCan I not when I have the ability to be safe in this country to a certain extent and so all of those things resting\nFocusing on what you love and then identifying that thing that gives you strength is what will get us through the next four years\n... I'd love to hear what your immigration story is I mean I Know that that had been part of what drives\nYou yeah that don't tell us how that still live I'm from Colombia I was born in Colombia um my mom was very young\nShe had me she had me at twenty two and she and my brother when she was Eighteen and so she immigrated to the United states with my father would come a few months earlier and so we immigrated to Los Angeles I'm so we were the only Colombians in LA\nYeah they they are like oh what are you\n[noise] um and so we came to the United states to Los Angeles we\nHad no family here my mom didn't speak English she barely had high school education and then after a few months of being in the United states my father abandoned us so he left my mom at the age of twenty four with a three year old and a six year old and an English no family no education with like two hundred dollars in her pocket\nAnd so my mom made miracles happen everyday she made the impossible happen every day and we went through being homeless we went through living being on welfare we went through living in the projects but through that all of that she was able to\nGet an education or sell shirts community college she worked at a fast food restaurant and she says that she learned English from ... Italian woman that didn't speak English [laughter] um so to this day and my mom's English is cute but not the best million I think about it [laughter]\nAnd so she put two kids through college we both have master's degrees\nYou know we have our own families she I we each on houses like we in many ways are the epitome of the American dream\nAnd and that is the thing that we all need to fight for no matter what aisle or how what is your belief system that as a thing that we need to fight for\nWhy did she leave Colombia [noise] you know she left because it's like\nHow so many immigrants do she wanted a better future for her children she was not going to find the feature that she wanted in Colombia in Colombia she knew that her future for her children was in the United states so she left everything that she knew she left her family she left her her friends she left her security and her safety\nTo go to follow a dream for her children and that's of immigrants to across the ... across the world or they're fleeing war or they're fleeing hunger but ultimately it's to better the other it's rarely to better yourself you want to provide for your family whether it's back home or whether it's for your children that are with\nYou so what made you want to become a filmmaker [noise]\nYou know my road to being an artist is a very different road as immigrant children there is a lot of responsibility\nTo to make sure that your parents sacrifices live up to the life that you're living so that translates to be the doctor\nBeing a lawyer to teach me something that it's like very um stable so when I decided that I Want it to be an artist my mom hit the fan she was like what\nAre you talking about she didn't talk fee for like three weeks he was like you can't do that you're going to start writing come to this country for you to starve\nNo no no no no and I finally sat down I told my mom was like mom this is what I Want to do and the reason why I Want to do it is because I found my voice I found a way in which I can express myself this is who I Am and you can either support me or you cannot but this is what I'm going to do\nSince then my mom has become my biggest fan she loves everything that I Do but that responsibility from\nFeeling the responsibility of needing to be a lawyer doctor or some sort of professional has shifted to what are the types of stories that I'm telling right that's my responsibility and so my responsibility as an artist as a filmmaker and even as an activist now is to shine a light on\nWomen in particular who stories we don't often hear\nWho we walk by on the street and we ignore them\nAnd to me those women are the one that I grew up with and the the unsung heroes of America there was a ... they they are the fabric of America that the dishwashers the janitors the caregivers um the caretakers and so that now and has been my my goal is a filmmaker is to tell those stories of love\nElectable and forgivable norm [noise] we aligned with all people of color and L. J. B. Q. causes and we will show our support in a nonviolent protest [noise]\nBut as you may also recall the name caused controversy because the organizers had appropriated that name from a march for African American women from Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe name was then changed to the women's march on Washington DC [noise] and the team set up their headquarters in the offices of legendary musician Harry Belafonte was an organizer for the march on Washington in Nineteen sixty three for the civil rights movement [noise]\nThat first part of the women's march get off the ground here ... [noise]\nYou know there was ... she put her her idea on Facebook because she had this idea and she was angry shoes organized she never organized before in our lives she lives in why she puts it on Facebook it's like I'm going to watch on march on Washington on January twenty first who's with me to go to sleep she wakes up at ten thousand people are saying she's coming she's like oh\nI don't know what I'm doing the she connects with Bob bled Bob ... and then connects with a whole bunch of other women I'm white women all of them are white they're not organizers and some of them one of them I don't know who actually says let's call it the million Man March so\nThat explodes on Facebook really because of the historical problems that feminism has had with white men and women of color in particular black limits so that [noise]\nOh and and it's a generational wound ... opens and those women I have to say those five women are six white women the organizing at that time realize\nOh well we don't have any women of color leading this with us we need to reach out and we need to find women of color so Vanessa rubble was one of those women she reaches out to Michael ... Michael school and it caused one to me can Carmen um who are the national co chairs along with Bob Glenn and they come on board\nThe damage was done right and what we did what I spend a lot of my time in a lot of the other women of color organizers from the women's march but ... but not our time on was reaching out to our community is to say hey yeah they've\nStep in the beginning but now this is a different this is a different organization it's it's it's all of us and we're leading the essence of what I said during that time is look\nWe don't have one woman of color at the or at the table we don't have to we actually have like eight women of color leading this thing like we are\nAt the table creating the vision the policy the unity principles what he's going to be if we don't show up now than what are we going to show up and the reality is is that most women that showed up at the women's march at the march on Washington were white\nLike that's the reality but we had a lot of women of color and we presented an intersection a movement and we did it in a way in which for the first time on the main stage was happening in the United states we did not come up with that concept Kimberly Crenshaw did in the eighties but nonetheless we said okay here here's this idea America\nRun with it and and they have and they didn't and people are bumbling through it and learning and and and trying to figure it out but I don't think that you can say that this movement is a white woman movement um because\nMost marginalized voices have been at the leadership from the beginning\nSo thinking about the role of art again in bringing more people in to the movement and more women of color into the movement that to our play a role in doing that as well as making sure that you know the women who are actually organizing it were Deborah ... yeah our\nWay to a huge role in the organization of the women's march and you know we ended up with you know over a hundred and fifty you know really well respected well known artists who we leaned on him very heavily to lead the charge on this stuff you know because\nWe were getting so much pushback but you know when America for era or um Eurasia Haiti or Tracey Ellis Ross posts about their support of the women's march suddenly you know a whole new audiences opened up to us we\nPelican speak more to this but we partnered with an organization called amplifier and all the most iconic artwork that you know is now so\nYou know visually like you're like oh the women's march you know oh that's the resistance that all came out of our partnership with amplifier who we continue to work with you know our consideration for who was going to be on the stage\nWhich ... was incredibly intentional and um you know\nThe collaboration that we had with\nArtists and you know the work we did on social media and the work that we did in our messaging I Would say we're you know a big part of the success\nAnd I would just say ... so we had an incredible honorary co chairs that were part of the women's march I'm Gloria Steinem was one that ... that was another Angela Davis\nA lid on Harris and then we had um Mr Harry Belafonte was also one of our on our cultures and we organize out of his offices that was women's march headquarters he left his his offices which was incredible um in one night\nIt was in December and it was very cold 'cause I remember very clearly I was late night of Mr B as we like to call him Mr be shut up at the office as a surprise and Mr be at that time he was eighty nine Ninety years old he had recently had a stroke so he came in with his locker who's a big deal for him to be there [noise]\nUm and my son happened to be there that night too 'cause I hadn't seen them for a while so we're sitting at the table at his table in his office and my son's on his lap this to be sitting there and he\nIs just like the most brilliant minds still and he's telling us stories about his time at a um while he organizes civil rights march the march on Washington and you know he had\nBob Dylan there and and Joan Baez there and and Lena Horne they're like he got all of the artist there that was his role his job\nAnd he said to us and this is something that really has stuck with me and he said it before obviously um but it has\nBeen kind of the er North Star mind North Star during this time and he said when the movement is strong the music is strong\nAnd we see that now where we are our movement is very strong um and we see how art and specifically music is being influenced by the movement you know again going back to black lives matter there is no lemonade by\nBeyond say without black lives matter right black lives matter\nMoved inspired and and force beyond say to tell that record to tell those stories um and and we can same thing with Kendrick Lamar like there is no Kendrick Lamar he's an amazing nurses he's an amazing rapper but\nWhat made him great in that moment was movement that was happening around him so where we are today with women we are starting to see the influence of this new women's movement in the art that is is is happening and his and his stemming from today\nThis is inflection point I'm Lauren she'll are my guests are artists and activists Palin Mendoza in Sarasota flicker two organizers of the women's march on Washington will be back right after a break\nAnd you're listening to an inflection point here on community supported public radio your T Ninety point five and K.
