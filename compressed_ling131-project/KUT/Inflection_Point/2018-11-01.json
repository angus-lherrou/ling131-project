... okay well let's\nPause there MS Thirteen reverse what specifically\nThat a violent transnational gang which the government says uh lately includes some ten thousand members living in forty us states now the New York times is reporting that those members are concentrated in Los Angeles New York and the region outside Washington DC another thirty thousand members live in Mexico and Central America\nOkay now what exactly was or works boat\nFor starters we did not draw details on that from the White House no backup butter Web search led us to learn that the house in twenty Seventeen last year voted mostly along party lines to send the Senate a measure related to deporting criminals gang members\nFrom the United states now most Democrats including ... voted no they voted against the proposal ... well\nWhat now what are the boat to have to do with shielding gang members from deportation\nWe wonder we weren't read it it's the house advance somebody gave you the name here at the criminal alien gang member removal act it authorizes officials in part to start deportation proceedings against someone in the country who is believed to be a member of a violent gang\nOn those grounds they even before the house voted the White House issued a statement of support\nNow under this proposal a deportation ... could start what regardless of whether someone is actually charged

happened affirmative vote I mean that that's that's hard to imagine to to to to shield violent gang members from deportation\nWe didn't find one and the and then the big picture we heard back from Chris Evans of ... campaign and also a Kato ensued expert his name is David beer each set existing law fully enables such deportations a once it was a criminal violation of your suggestion to this is the fella from Kato right he suggested there significance in this debate\nIn the absence of stories about MS Thirteen gang members the government can't currently deport without a change in law and his point if there was a problem if there were examples we'd be hearing about them\n[noise] okay so all told how did this Trump claim fare on the politifact Texas truth o meter\nEditor saw an element of

I mean spreading in states where they were striking is illegal\nAnd um you know mostly women strikers we're extracting deals from their state governments for higher wages higher pay 'em I was like oh my God I Wish the book where outright now and then I handed it in and it was being edited very quickly\nUm their typos really sorry um and there was that there were the immigration policy protests and women in foil blankets and the Hart office building of the Senate and Maxine Waters encouraging protests\nAnd and public gathering and then being reviewed by members of her own party um for being on civil about which I was completely can live it and I was like oh my God I Wish the book out now [noise] um and then there was Les Moonves was like I Wish the book out now\nAnd then the book came out ... uh like five days after the cabin on testimony\nYeah and I had actually had the book in my hand I don't know maybe a month before the Kavanaugh hearings and once you read the book everything\nChanges there's a whole other filter that you start to put on the things that you see around you and the way that women are perceived\nFor getting angry for not getting angry for men for getting angry and the way the way that the world looks as tall as I read this book and I imagine that for for those of you to read it you will and maybe even after the end of this conversation you also have that same experience because\nIt just started to create a framework for what we were seeing it I'm Glad\nThe him really it it's lovely to hear that because I intended it to be a tool right not knowing that it was\nGoing to come out in the midst of what turned out to be this horrific um news cycle that's not just a new cycle it's now the rest of our lives\nUm and our children's lives and our lives right um but\nAnd and the reason I wanted to read it quickly it's because I felt like I for myself having thoughts about anger suddenly as the framework that connected a lot of the writing I've been doing a lot of the history that I've studied I thought that\nIt could be a tool for so many women who were feeling all of this stuff that we are discouraged from expressing and there are a lot of forces out there that are going to tell you that it it makes you ugly and unattractive and emotion you know you sound too emotional to be believed and why are you acting like this year so crazy and you're you've totally change\nAnd I wanted it to be a tool um for women to better be able to ... the thing that they're feeling and experiencing with in American history but I what people who've read it it all also does offer I think a filter for what we've just heard and I didn't know that that was going to be a function that had happened\nSo actually I I'd love to have you read from part of your book that it it it's a ... it's ... I don't know maybe the last\nThird of the book that I think that's an excellent job of signing up this idea of the chaos\nThat we are starting to create and that control that are patriarchy\nWould like to exert I'm so can I have you read that section sure um and it is it's about the notion that when women get angry\nAnd voice it the world becomes disrupted and chaotic cat cats\nWas what former Senator Barbara Mikulski had remembered in Nineteen Ninety One when the women of the house had banked on the door and insisted that Senate leader George Mitchell Mitchell talk to them about letting Anita Hill testify against Clarence Thomas\nThere was a sense that the whole process if not spinning out of control was getting very chaotic Mikulski remembered of that day and an oral history in which he'll recalled that senator Mitchell's approach had been let's keep things under control\nUnder his control the women's insistence that they get to talk that they got to insist that he'll get to tell her story\nWas the moment that George Mitchell lost control yes things were out of control this is actually a section where I'm writing about me to the hash tag me too movement last fall yes things were out of control that was the point because control\nWas when no one was able to report the story of Harvey Weinstein raping women control was Donald Trump getting elected president thanks to voter suppression in the electoral college system is designed to suppress and us that are controlled non white population\nControl was the unchallenged reigns of Bill O'Reilly and Roger ales and Bill Cosby\nControl was women being too terrified to defy Eric Schneiderman by telling of how he hit them\nControl was ensuring that no one cared about the abuses sustained by Ford factory employees or flight attendants control was all male presidents and vice presidents control was only two black women senators and no black women governors in the history of the country\nControl was marital rape being legal to the seventies control with slavery and locking women in unsafe shortwave factories control was Jordan Peterson's towers white\nSerpent thrust at us against our will and women ordinary women understood this\nThe ... them carefully tracking Americans attitudes about gender told me twenty Seventeen that her polling had shown a huge majority of voters eighty six percent who connected the notions of harassment and assault to a quote\nDesire for power and control over women\nUnder ... told me that she's also seen a very sudden and striking shift after years of polling on reproductive rights for the first time she had a gun to hear voters use the words control and controlling women when discussing efforts to restrict women's access to abortion enter contraception\nTo some extent women who won at liberty and equality knew they had to create some chaos and yeah it was moving was such velocity and intensity that it was terrifying and its unpredictability but it had to be radical and raft full and energetic to get people to pay attention\nAnd to actually alter the power dynamics room had to be changed as they had been in the second wave when marriages entered into an unequal terms we're no longer acceptable\nAnd the fact that some of them ended with a sudden shock to the system and some men felt they had been unfairly victimized by swiftly changing expectations\nNow about groping and salacious ... and harassment were no longer going to be acceptable and some and we're going to lose their jobs and some of them would no doubt that they had been unfairly victimized\nBut this was what it meant to say that we wanted the world should be different not and some have the future after all the old not different men had retired from their purchases and die peacefully in their sleep\nWe wanted to be different now and that meant dethrone in some of them early things had to get out of control the law cannot do it for us Shirley Chisholm had said we must do it for ourselves women in this country must become revolutionaries\nSo I I Do want to acknowledge we do have men in the audience and I really want to thank you for being here and being our allies [laughter]\nUm [noise] I\nDon't think that this women's anger is about hitting ... I mean I think we just need to be super clear about that because some people might not understand that right\nNo it's not at all I mean I write a lot in the book about how one of the reasons that it's so hard you know mass women's movements in the book is about women's anger about all kinds of injustice and inequity it's women's anger at unjust and unsafe working conditions and low wages and economic inequality it's women's anger about racism and\nAnd races silence um and one of the things I write about in the book is that one of the hardest inequities to form mass movements around is gender inequity and in part\nThe the lower middle strikers also use the language as our forefathers resisted the bloody avarice of the British Government they called on that rhetoric too but ... that is this is an especially interesting case she is working she's in slave woman in the home of\nA man and gauge in revolutionary era politics and she's badly abused in this home the the wife hits or with a ... kitchen implement\nAnd she hears this rhetoric and the political argument of of the American revolution in her home and she applies the arguments to her own condition and petitions for freedom\nAnd she wins her case and the case goes on to be one of the legal underpinnings for what becomes the the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts in Seventeen eighty three but none of us have ever heard of that and then in the cases\nOf the women that we have heard of I was taught in school about Rosa Parks and what I was taught about Rosa Parks was that she was extremely tired [noise] which I have no doubt that she was [noise]\nThat she was very stoic I was taught and this is so strange to me I was taught him knew in my bones from the time I was in second grade or whatever that she was a seamstress\nHere's what I was never taught about Rosa Parks she wrote about\nAnd talked about racism that she felt from the time that she was a girl she was trained and political activism in civil disobedience her decision to keep her seat on the bus that day\nWas not born simply of being tired it was a political act she knew what she was doing she was doing it intentionally and her compatriots in that movement understood that and there was ... in in recent years there's a terrific book by Danielle McGuire that was published a few years ago called it the dark into the streets that really excavated the history of Rosa Parks\nAnd it became more popularly understood in recent years\nBut at the time during the civil rights movement many of the women in that movement Gloria Richardson an article hedging then poly Murray Dorothy Height they were angry about the way that Rosa Parks is story had been minimized in sanitized\nThis was an anger that existed within a civil rights movement in real time and yet her story was still repeatedly\nPresented as one of not of anger not of\nRighteous fury but of quiet room proper so says them of of ... citizen is the non violence and of course much in silver rights movement was built on non violent protests but that was the thing\nThat was heralded and could be digestible in palatable when American public\nAnd we have to think about why that is\nRebecca when and how did you get comfortable expressing your anger um well\nYou know the land actually before you even answer the question let me tell you is a very short and ... to all of you when I taught a friend of mine that I Would be speaking with you she said Rebecca Traister it's the best every time I see her on TV there's fire coming out of her now [laughter]\nSo anyway how did you get to that [laughter]\nWell you know I I think there was a point there when I wrote for salon and began to write about him and his own which was you know\nFourteen fourteen years ago um it was at a period where there had been decades of a kind of anti feminist um deep freeze backlash deep freeze where there hadn't been a huge\nAmount of feminist journalism and mainstream media for anybody who's now grown up in a world where there is actually a feminist media and like\nSome of this journalist is a profession like this will sound very unfamiliar but there were a bunch of people\nWho sort of in the same years started writing about the news in pop culture from a feminist perspective and I was among them and there were many of us I think to great pains either consciously or just instinctively to obscure whatever anger might've undergrad at our work and if you're writing about\nGender inequality and racial inequality and economic inequality of course anger is to some extent\nI'm a foundation of why you do what you do\nBut I I was among those who took pains to be like funny and easy going and my tone and and light and by the way it didn't matter I still got all kinds of hate mail but I think that a lot of the a lot of the\nWomen and some of the few men who were who were writing about\nThese things from a feminist perspective in those years we're taking great pains after the bitter backlash toward second wave feminism that characterize everybody as angry screaming man hating sex lift humorless heritage and to prove that that's not what this new generation of feminism was\nUm and that meant making sure that nothing sounded too angry\nThey you know even though everybody just called this angry anyway as if that insult was sort of self contained you sound angry [noise] so it was later in my career um that there was actually a day there was actually a day\nWhen I was so pissed about a number of things including a lot of things that I was reading about in the news and my own professional situation this was at a later\nJob and I just wrote a column at a furious that anger and I didn't take any pains to make it prettier I was just livid and I submitted it and much to my surprise my editor at the time at the New Republic was like this is great and just published it and I just sort of I just didn't care and that he's having to go viral and\nIt was a tremendous lesson to me about the communicative power of anger it wasn't just something that necessarily push people away or that was divisive voicing anger\nCould be meaningful to people who are feeling it but maybe hadn't said it themselves or hadn't heard it from somebody else and then it can create connection so after that and that's the turning point that I can\nThink of what was the first time I remember just sort of letting loose with ... Roth fury and that's not something I Try to replicate because I Do know that there are costs and this is something I Want to say about my own ability to go on TV I I can be angry on TV Now but I'm In an extraordinarily unusual\nPosition and I want to be really clear that nothing that I'm writing in this book is suggesting to other women just go out and rage right if you want to and you have a comfort and and feel safe voicing your anger then that's I encourage it\nBut part of the book is about the very real holes and risk and censure\nThat women who are angry still face if they express it right it would have backfired on Christine Blasey Ford if she'd gone on in there and yells\nYou may be angry because of the way that you're treated at work and have every reason to be angry but if you go in and expressed that anger you risk getting fired you risk not getting a promotion you risk getting a reputation as difficult or crazy in a way that\nThat is going to imperil you economically and professionally if you are a woman of color who is pulled over or question about something that is ridiculous you have every reason in the world to be livid but if you express that anger that puts you at risk of not only arrest incarceration but but injury and death\n[noise] there are real totals out their imposed on women who are willing to unapologetically expressed their age and I would never recommend to women that the thing we have\nTo do is further alter our behavior and be mad in different ways or be mad and louder ways and and find ways to work within a system that fundamentally doesn't make room for or want to hear about our anger the degree to which I have any kind of prescription for what to do going forward isn't about expressing our own anger it's about changing the way we listened to\nAnd hear the anger of other women\nBecause that's the only way that we can begin to alter the reception that women's anger deaths and it's about being curious about why other women are angry so many of the women I interviewed for this book said to me you're the first person who's ever asked me why I'm angry\nWe have to start asking the women around us who are angry understanding that for many of us especially white women and privileged women some of the anger that we may be asking about is going to be directed toward us and we need to listen\nAnd think about the validity and the and the political implications of what other women's anger maybe we need to respect\nIt more and treated the way we treat white men's anger which is fundamentally diagnostic there's a study that I say in the book that says when people look at pictures of angry people they look at the pictures of angry women and assume that those women are just angry all the time that I mean the the there just\nIs [noise] and they look at pictures of men who have anger on their face\nAnd they assume that something bad happened in that man's day so that the anger of men is understood to be pointing you towards something that needs to be fixed whereas the anger of women suggest that it's the women themselves that needs to be fixed\nAnd we need to change that we need to start treating women's anger as a as an expression that can direct us toward something that's wrong what is what does this woman's anger tell us about what's wrong with the world\nAnd how do we take seriously the thing that's making her angry and so for me the directive\nIs less about how we all figure out how to express our anger differently and more about how we figure out how to hear women thinker differently", "show_name": "Inflection Point", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "01"}
