{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Yeah I noticed that now or did it work in fact cast such a vote well\nYou could indirectly say yeah you might could argue that let me get to what the paper the Dallas papers at work voted against a non binding resolution that express opposition to such a tad right which is the time president bronco bomber was urging to pay for infrastructure spending\nNow let me get this clear or you say he or that this was a non binding resolution so we're not talking about an up or down vote on the tax itself\nIt doesn't look to me a quick glance and reading the more you store that ... there was any kind of up or down vote on the tax itself the work did tell the news that he's open to discussing the prospect of some kind of tax or other approaches to help the country rebuild the infrastructure\nOkay now what about any other politifact Texas ... checks bearing on this debate\nRoared you'll remember charge Cruz was shutting down the government for six yeah\nRight right right right is this the sort of filibuster I'm thinking about the one that Cruz spiced up by reading green eggs and ham on the Senate floor you remember\nThem you know the shore of member that in earlier this year politifact in Washington rated pants on fire and that means incorrect ridiculous uh cruises claimed that he never once voted not to fund the government he sure did back then before\nFinally backing down all the cause of the funding the Obamacare law despite the certainty at the time to President Obama would veto such a move\nIn fact I think I heard over ... stress that Texas is the least insured state and that's something that politifact looked into\nYour right and he said that twice once during the debate and once it was closing the Census Bureau has reported that as a twenty sixteen about one in six Texans lacked health coverage in twenty Seventeen the Gallup poll found even more Texans saying they had no health coverage north of twenty two percent to about the highest percentage among the\nStates so I guess we're still number one by that metric ... did Senator Cruz nail any of these claims for past ... chicks\nWe noticed this he softened up a claim previously found fault huh my list of words that in the debate yeah absolutely\nCongressman O'Rourke he's the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country\nWho is explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump\nOh right right right the only nominee to explicitly support impeachment and that's a change in Cruz's characterization right\nYeah he was he said or work was the nation's only Senate candidate to back impeachment uh for instance a that's not right because it's a California Democrat on November is about who has said that what Trump's done qualifies from Kevin de Leon is facing an uphill battle he's ... he's battling another Democrat incoming Dianne Feinstein\nOkay uh what about anything else a popping up in this debate that was a ...\nOr ... defended his opposition to building a border well that was a big deal in India in part by touting El Paso safety listening\nTo it El Paso in fact as one of the safest cities in the United states of America\nAre such claims about I'll pass those relative safety always almost invariably come from ... press manually issues rankings that say cities looked like this are looked like that compared to others right there was a problem\nThey rely on the FBI publish statistics and the FBI says do not use this data unique to individual communities to compare communities are okay or going to be ready to similar work claim half true last year\nI remember All right a lot more of a sudden the debate perhaps touching off more effect checks to come I'll report back on that you know he will he's gardeners

week great and you are listening to the Texas standards [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSpeaking of seeing someone again there's Michael mark sees a Texan standard producer filling in for wells Dunbar hey day past couple of days or what her Texans talking about\nWell talking about the twenty eight cheating midterms will only intensify as we approach election day over the next ... yeah I think that average as it should\nOf her many if you would do to just for a moment skip ahead to twenty twenty yes really twice way we're already there just for a second we're not already there but ah but someone's already thinking about it someone from Texas we heard about this and the Texas round up who Leon ... oh right\nRight I got the book I think he he's got a book in several ambitions he is of course the former mayor of San Antonio went on to serve as the\nHousing and urban development secretary and the Obama administration interview with Rolling Stone released yesterday Castro said on the subject of running for president quote\nI'm likely to do it I have a strong vision for the country I Believe that our country's going in the wrong direction and that it needs new leadership I'll make a final decision after ... after November but I'm inclined to do it interesting quite a statement yeah let's say the people of Texas a robust discussion happening on the Texas standard Facebook page\nIn Dallas walking Nicholas Munoz wonders what is he thinking if Trump was able to beat all those Republican career politicians he ran against and twenty sixteen and hijack the party he will absolutely destroy Castro Castro\nXi's he's he's been around the block of Utah I mean he knows his way around politics seasonal neophyte\nWell Patricia Patricia Thomas says that if this was the plan disappearing for the past decade probably wasn't wise and to be fair he has not exactly disappeared for five years he is like we said served in the Obama administration although\nIn politics and elsewhere certainly perception is reality in Corpus Christi tens gray writes that for conservatives Castro is a soft target bring him on the dentist must do better than the Castro's Trump will destroy this guy easily\nIn Jordan Peterson ways in he says I liked Castro but they put them in how to store him away to be vice president someday he's\nNot ready to run for president of course he was a final

Indiana born and raised and down I had never heard that before we don't see that happening Canada and I knew at that point that I was in\n[noise] my name is ... and you know they seem to K. U. T. Austin live\nThe time commitment and and kind of what the\nIntricacies of a campaign where but I had already done the type of work that door knocking and the phone banking and the organizing volunteers and creating the training and figuring out how do we explain these ideas in a way that's not jar guinea but it accessible to people how do we listen and take the stories that we hear every day and turn them into policy solutions\nA that was you know ... second nature to me and by that point what I actually thought was that when I was elected I Would have to a head of issue or lose my organizing\nInstincts and learn something different and what I learned is that might organizer instincts were just as valuable if not more so as a policymaker I'm as they were when I was a campaign organizer or a person who worked on campaigns\nAh organizing is essentially bringing folks together to talk about what is this issue what are we going to do about it and who's going to do it and I found in the legislature that those instincts helped me get bills passed\nA like I've passed a bill as a freshman in the minority a deep minority and I was the only person who flipped a seat from Republican to Democrat in the state house in twenty sixteen\nSo I can be honest and I say there's not a lot of love for me from some of the leadership on the Republican side and yet I still got a bill passed my first year in office\nAnd that was organizing and making sure that I was taking stories I was hearing in my community and hearing it was a bill about veterans can hearing and the veterans community and bringing it to the chair of the veterans committee and getting him to be my number two on the bill\nAnd then my number three was the tax chair who at this bill eventually had to go through the tax committee on those organizing instincts really helps me be successful and my term\nIn office well what about the actual decision to run for office in the first place so we've been hearing about you know more women than ever are running for office and I'm really curious what [laughter]\nWhat is it actually mean in real life not just the headlines and what does it take to make the decision to run for office so\nI was working for Congressman Ellison and I was filling in for a co worker actually he had a visit set up with a shared and story which is a nonprofit that partners local businesses are churches with schools will have a significant number of students who faced the weekend hunger gaps and when they don't have access to food between friday and Monday at school\nAnd this was not in my issue area so I just drove him to the visit gave him the brief that my colleague had wrote and I was kind of sitting in the back and they were talking about the issue of childhood hunger and where is that in Minnesota\nAnd there was this map on the wall of where they serve and my wife uh elementary school was on the map and I thought to myself oh yeah real poverty is a thing and then I saw my elementary school and I saw my middle school and I saw my high school on that map\nAnd I Googled under the table and I should have been listening to the presentation about childhood hunger and I found an article that had been written probably the previous week\nAbout childhood hunger having gone up and poverty excuse me in my elementary school three hundred and eighty four percent and the ten years since I had graduated from high school and I still lived in the community I still went to church in my community and I have not heard anything about this issue and I was\nQuite frankly pets and so after the meeting with a shared in story when I was driving Congress and all of a sudden to the next\nThe next event he was supposed to be going to and I should have been briefing him on it\nI was just ranting I was like I'm going to go to my church and we are going to contact the schools and we are going to participate in this program and he kind of challenge me like when are you going to run for office and change the systems that don't allow families to pay the rent and feed their kids in the same month and I was like hold on okay I work for people who are elected\nAnd he said well what are you waiting for\nAnd I really did not have an answer for that yeah I didn't need more community experience I didn't need more organizing experience I didn't need more passion for policy I wasn't really waiting for anything I guess I was just waiting for someone asked me [laughter] so um I went home and I talked to my wife and I said would it be crazy if we did this and she said you should absolutely do this and\nAnd we just were ago from that point on\nOkay so you you were up against the tea partier yeah when you ran and um you flip the seat and what like what advice do you have for other women or\nCandidates who are in a similar position I mean we have a lot of people in that position right now is that we as we come up to the mid term elections cross country\nSo the first is that you know your community better than anybody else does um a lot of people like I had said we'll give you advice because of what they think I'm but I got to ignore it and I could ignore it because I knew that they were wrong because I was already talking to my community so\nPeople who are running they know their community is trust your thought on that and then actually talked to folks do the work door knock\nYou would constituents be available on taking their stories learn new things um learn the what gets people up in the morning what keeps people up at night type stuff on those issues of your community\nDon't be afraid to take a position have a position on some things don't waffle people's sense and authenticity in a very real way and when they are trying to send someone to represent themselves and their immediate neighbors for you know the next\nThirty nine thousand five hundred or seven hundred thousand or what have you they need to know that you're going to tell the truth about how you feel about an issue and um and then you're going to go shop and do that and if you don't know something the honest asked you know every piece of advice that you get run it through your own lens I just think that there's so many people who try to\nUm distill a candidate down to just this like very\nMechanical thing and it's just not or humans voters are humans your human\nThey'd like to see that your human they'd like for you to acknowledge that they are human um we we lose that humanity when we try to get really\nTechnical about this work that we do um hire people of color and women to work on her campaign and to be in your campaign offices and then to be on your staff because once you're elected it's not just you if you and your staff or doing that work and it shows up if your staff is a continuation of what we've always had 'em\nAnd you know be able to I have\nA slogan for my campaign it's committed to community and it was always a really easy way to explain to people what I'm for right when I was like elevator pitch not even like elevator door opening I could say committed to community be able to have that type of thing to explain to people very specifically what your for because\nIn a very fast paced world\nI'm not helped by what's happening in DC you're going to want to be able to get that message out very simply and then over and over and over again\nAnd on the over and over and over again pieced are going to have to stay the same thing's a million times for someone to hear them once you're not repeating yourself you're just being consistent so don't be afraid to keep saying the same thing\nI'm learn Schiller and this is inflection point my guest is Minnesota state representative Aaron make waited for more stories of how women rise up subscribe to the inflection point pod cast we'll be right back\nYou're listening to inflection point here on Austin's NPR station ... Eugene already point five and could you do you go to a large\nSupport comes from Erie range from center hosting Michael ... author of the English version for reading from his latest novel war line

Online anytime without breaking away from their day details on care and scheduling options can be found at gets eaten care dot com\nI learned Shiller indices inflection point my guess is Minnesota state representative Aaron ...\nSo when you decided to go for it you you were clearly up against some high stakes tell me about that experience of running what did you run into what was challenging about it for you and what and what did you feel like I was really great about it so right away when I\nStarted to run they told me not to talk about race and equity um so forcefully they told me not to talk about guns so when I started running for office my wife works for every town for gun safety and moms demand action and I have just been with her\nI'm at meetings and talking to survivors and hearing some of the stories about parents with kids going through lockdown drills and um it was a very personal issue to us to me and I talked about it a lot and they were like ... ... talk about guns in the suburbs\nUm you know don't be progressive you should moderate yourself and you know I never did any of those things that that was the overwhelming advice of most people\nAnd the difference for me and so this was probably the good part is that this is a community I was born and raised and my parents moved\nTo the community I represent in Nineteen eighty two they have their wedding reception at the local community center they have lived their their whole lives we were raised there so these are people that I Know these are my teachers these are my pastors these are my fellow churchgoers these are my friends are my friends' parents\nAnd so when I Would get this bad advice from people who didn't live in my community and be like oh okay sure and then I Would know in my heart and my gut\nThat that's not what the people of my community want I never wanted to run a race where I was trying to run towards some missile logical middle\nI'm In order to be elected I wanted to tell the truth about what I believed in and what I think that we should do as a state legislature in terms of policy and where I thought we were at as a community and if people were on board than they would vote for me and if they weren't than they wouldn't but I never wanted to win by pretending to be someone that I'm not to be so\nI really enjoyed talking to my community and learning kind of some of the more interesting issues that I hadn't been aware of beforehand\nThat's so interesting so I mean can you tell me more about who they you know he does then this is this somebody they are I mean is it that sort of I don't know for lack of better the establishment you know other people who are already in politics or who who is giving you this advice to kind of cover up who your authentic self really is you know it could\nAnd then just like handed over to\nYou know the chamber representative to sell the bill an answer the questions on the person just sits on the side I wasn't prepared for that it was mind blowing that someone could take such a\nLazy way a of legislating\n[noise] well let's talk about the sexual harassment [laughter]\nThere's there's lazy people everywhere but they don't they don't have to be sexual harassment everywhere right so even though there are [laughter] but let's let's talk about the sexual harassment because my understanding is that you were actually harassed while you were still a candidate\nAnd then it continued once once you got elected so that's that's one person um whose name has been public\nAs a senator shown he was a former state senator shown a in my own party so when I was\nI'm a candidate I worked for Congress and all of a sudden there was a very public I'm shooting of an unarmed black man named mark clerk and it happened about\nA hundred feet from where Congress Allison's offices and so there was an occupation of the fourth precinct Minneapolis police department\nUm for a long time and the senator was then the state representative and he had reached out to me just say if he's a police officer as well and he had reached out to me to say\nUm if you want to talk about like the law enforcement aspect of this with this whole thing let me know and I was like yeah I'm just doing my job for this isn't part of my campaign um and then\nAnd we kept taxing the and trying to meet up and I was like I'd never met him before I thought maybe he was just weird but persistent and then he sent me a text message a it was not meant for me it was not for someone else and it just said I'm working on her pretty hard I haven't got are quite yet but I'm I'm working on her [noise]\nUm and I should know what to do with that I wasn't elected yet he was um I was trying to be part of the caucus I didn't know who I talked to his campaign manager I talked to has a leader do I talk to his Senate district I mean there's just no clear avenue to say anything so I didn't at the time\nSo once you once you got elected and he's he was still he's still held the seat\nYet he ran for state Senate in that same election so he was actually I'm In a different chamber um he's a senator then after that and then in the legislature there were other representatives who were the perpetrators of the sexual harassment there was the chair of the public safety committee\nTwenty Cornish um who would send really I mean he'd say really gross things that he sent me a really gross text message that was a\nUm he had been staring at me on the floor and I felt someone staring at me so I looked up and I kinda did I have heard wave and he sent me a tax that said I got\nBusted for staring at you on the floor it's your fault for looking too damn good if I ran for governor I must be more gentle mentally I said well you could always sir now [laughter] um and that was the third or fourth time he had said something really gross um some people who sat\nClose to behind me on the floor would say things while I was speaking on the floor and giving speeches about my body and what a waste but I'm a lesbian those kinds of things\nI learned Schiller and this is inflection point my guess is Minnesota state representative Erin ... subscribe to the inflection point pod cast to hear more rising up stories when we come back\nAaron has to make a tough decision was she continue to put up with this toxic nail nonsense will she stand up and say me too I\nJust wanted it to stop right like I wasn't trying to say you should fire him you should take away his chairmanship like I just wanted it to ... talk to your guy making fun of

Lawrence Taylor and this is inflection point my guest is Minnesota state representative Aaron may Quaid before the break Aaron shared her story of going public with allegations of sexual harassment by both down showing and Tony Cornish so why were you the first person to call them out\nOh I think it's a combination of a few things um you know when it happened and there were a few other times that had happened as well just in person and verbally um you know I reported it to the speaker of the house\nYou know I just I just wanted it to stop right like I wasn't trying to say you should fire him you should take away his chairmanship like I just wanted it to stop talking to your guy\nMaking fun of doing this um and then we wanted a mandatory sexual harassment training for all legislators 'cause a lot of them had been there before we actually did sexual harassment training and when I came forward about the senator on my own party my intention was actually to just say that and be done [noise]\nAnd the speaker I'm On asked said no one has ever made a report of sexual harassment to me since I've been speaker and I was like well that's no it was I mean it wasn't true I had reported it and so at that time I decided to come forward because I was done with men protecting other man's crappy behavior\nAnd so you know for both senator shown and an represented Cornish there were I mean dozens more than a dozen women that came forward I think it was more than twenty four for senator shown in more than thirty representative Cornish and he had assaulted a lobbyist he wasn't allowed to have female staffers it was just the reason I came forward was\nBecause I was angry that this was a part of my job I was angry that this had been happening to people for so long but I also had a little bit of power\nIn my election certificate and that you know I couldn't be fired for coming forward whereas other folks a lot of other folks could and the Harvey Weinstein thing was really the um the impetus for me to come forward about both men because I was in\nI was in D.C for a conference and I was sitting in my hotel room and that story came out\nAnd I was just reading all of the people who were acknowledging that this is something that they've known it was the worst kept secret in Hollywood and it's like we have that here and if there is one more woman that have sexually harassed or assaulted and I didn't say anything I didn't use this modicum of power that I have that I Will so responsible and that's a really part of why came forward\nWell when you did come forward I I saw a news clips of you talking about the harassment but you were reluctant to name the horizon or a and in a moment is really quite fun tanning [laughter] you said you know what it\nHears his name is Tony Cornish which I think you know I I didn't see the reaction of the report [laughter] I'm sure his he was picking his drop off the table what in that moment I mean why were you rest reticent to say his name and then what changed in your mind what was going through your mind\n[noise] so I was reticent because so keep in mind we're trying to put through a background checks and all gun sales and\nUm red flag laws and de criminalizing you know certain things in our state statute and the chair of the public safety committee was Tony Cornish he holds the gavel he decides the bills and 'em\nKnowing the kind of power that he had I was you know I Would still have to go back and work with these legislators uh\nAfter coming forward and I am not in the majority I'm In the minority and I'm I was nervous about that having to have professional consequences for telling the truth in public about public servants\nAnd so the reason and that in them and it was if it is because there was a staffer who is sitting off the side I kind of look over before I say it and I'm that person had told me a story as we had been walking to the interview\nAbout being harassed by represent I'm Cornish and I was like you know what no I'm not going to sit next to someone who was harassed by this person who can't come forward because their staff\nAnd not say it and I had text messages to which was helpful and kind of quote unquote proving that this was going on\n[noise] so in the end Cornish and shown both resigned right I mean is that is that the only ... forgive forgive my everyday on how this works that can they be fired or do they have to resign so\nA numbers can be expelled by the legislature but it takes and insanely high threshold and that certainly wouldn't happen I don't I mean it might have in the Senate to be perfectly honest with you but it certainly wasn't going to happen in the house the reason representative Cornish resigned as it was part of his settlement\nWith the um uh salt lawsuit with the lobbyists that he assaulted\nGot it and then shown resigned and what what gotten him to resign\nUm I Want to give credit to both the chair of our party and the majority and minority leader in the Senate for both calling for him to resign I was very nervous that when I spoke out\nUm they would not say anything or you know maybe defend him on and they were very quick with saying this is not OK and he should resign even though we you know we had a\nA one seat minority in the state Senate and so that opened up a special election which could have put us further into the minority and um they were\nVery quick and saying this is not OK and he should resign which I appreciate so I think that a big and he's also a police officer and so I think not dragging it out on and being able to keep the job he had outside of the legislature was important to him as well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inflection Point", "city": "Austin", "day": "18"}
