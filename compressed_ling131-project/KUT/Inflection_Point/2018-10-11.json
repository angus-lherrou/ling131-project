I I imagine\nAnyone can do desk research and you know Google Search on on this and that but there there must be other methods yeah well I think\nYou're totally right that opposition research that term has been thrown around a lot in the news and I think it's important is a good time to kind of talk about what what ... research isn't what it is not\nRight it gets this mess and I think a Hollywood quality to it that it's I'm kind of losing it private detective it's investigators it I'm\nFrankly a lot of older white men doing things um\nAnd in reality it is a lot of critical thinking using your political judgment skills and understanding the power of story\nAt its most basic research entails I'm\nKind of collecting all the data that you can about the subject that you're looking at whether that's a person a policy issue um or an organization and\nKind of ... through the the granular detail is to to kind of pull out one thread were a couple of threads that help we've a story\nYou know so for instance if a candidate let's say wants to say that they are\nA champion for women in family\nIt's my job as a researcher at you understand the different data points and proof points that we need 'em to help backup that claim so whether it's that they've taken certain vote and understanding their you know political vote history if they've been in office before\nUm maybe as understanding all of the past op ed that they've written and and pulling out the few that they're really touch on the impact that they've had for women and families or maybe if their political donations they've been giving to ship progressive candidates for some time you know we want to look at all of that data that's available\nAnd then kind of stuff through it and really um highlight him pinpoint a few of the the the real facts of a person's background um so it it is about I think identifying\nI'm your strength and a candidate strengths as much as it is understanding their vulnerability um and then kind of matching that shoot to prove a point or tell a story um ultimately to the voters\nWell one of the criticisms that Hillary Clinton received was that she came across as not feeling like a real person and it wasn't until she started to reveal the story of her childhood and how that informed her as an adult\nThrough a story and it was you know the the big video that was unveiled that that a Democratic National convention did emily's list have role and that was that some like she realized it felt like she realized that so late in the ... [laughter] yeah it seems like so fundamental to the ability to connect with a person to understand their story do do you have any\nThoughts on you know when and where that came from and why it took so long you know I I I totally hear\nThat and I and you know I don't know if I'm only had a role in that per se or not that probably above my pay grade but what I Will tell you is that um you know that's a critique\nThat's been leveled on Secretary Clinton um since her first campaign and I and I think it's one that comes out women often and I think if you take a step\nBack and you kind of imagine a world in which a woman is running for president or just running for office period there is a fear of opening oneself up too much you know I I feel like women candidates and especially Secretary Clinton you know they get criticized if they're too emotional\nAnd they get criticized if they're not emotional Ina I'm and I I think it's a fine balance and a hard line to walk for for anybody much less a oh a female candidate who's running for office under tremendous amount of scrutiny\nYou know I think her personal stories I felt\nMoved to me so much um even when she you know the Democratic national convention that you're describing that video that moment was so powerful\nUm and even some of the smaller things that she did when she did the real stories of New York [noise] um I thought that was just such a great moment and she told her own story as so many other you know citizens of New York at had had done before her um\nSo you know I think it's a fine line with women candidates I think they they have to balance so much\nI'm In no matter what they do right\n[noise] well I Would love to hear you talk more about the power of story because it does feel like we are living in this time right now and maybe we always have been of conflicting narratives around the same information\n[noise] I I'm a person who believes in real facts\n[laughter] I Love ... information [laughter] uh and I I totally agree with you I feel like we are in a space where I'm fake news is prevalent we can cultivate our own ah news channels if you will on Twitter or Facebook\nYou can build your own echo chamber if you want 'em but I think it's the power of story that allows candidates and activists and leaders to really connect with people in a real way you know sometimes it's not enough to just talk about\nThat child care's expensive for example\nAs soon as you start to bring in your own story and talk about how you know the very notion of paying over two thousand dollars a month for your child care and how that's more than your mortgage or your rent 'em and how you might have to quit work just to make an economical for yourself\nTo be able to to provide your child child care um it's not until you tell that story that someone might see themselves in it and then they connect with you on a on a much deeper level um and I think it's it's bringing your own human side to an issue\nOr a debate that always moved people um\nI I also will say I have to believe that those stories need to be based in fact which is my job right it's my job as a researcher to make sure that that any story that we're telling is factually accurate because we have to if we're asking our voters are supporters to invest in us we have to trust them and give them the real truth\nOh notice most awkward silence ever [laughter] most awkward silence and uh we got home and I'm pretty sure I walked into the house and I said I said mom\nDid you know that [laughter]\nShe goes I think she said something like yes Kate of course I knew like never talked\nAbout this before and it we just never had that conversation that we weren't a political household necessarily but it's kind of that tipping point right that tipping point of me being like\nMy mom did you know like yes he of course then [laughter] clearly been talking about it but I I just hadn't been a piece of that conversation but you know I probably before that I was I\nWas in college and had taken you know political science courses and women's studies courses and was active in women's organizations on campus uh I\nThink I was in a performance of The Vagina monologues that my parents came to campus to see which was a whole a glorious moment for both of our political awakenings um I I you know I think we've had we shared some of those moments but it really was until that point that I was like oh okay well let's talk about it it's all in the open now\nAnd ... that's how we kind of grew from there\nWell I guess if you're going to\nYou can stand you might as well do it through The Vagina [laughter] with your parents girl audience girl I mean\nI [laughter] I Wish I wasn't shy then\nBut [laughter] what okay so let's just go off on that has been for a minute what inspired you to stand up and do that\nYou know it was how do I say that so I think a friend was doing it\nAnd I thought it would be really cool um\nI also you know ... you know in college you want to do the things that your friends are doing um I think I also brought a couple of friends along with me for the ride but I'd never done performance before you know I think\nA performance and that way surely I had performed other things that you know in life um but I never really kind of stood up in front of people and I did or\nUm read something and certainly nothing that was political in nature at all and the moment kind of came up where\nI was a production of it happening on campus and I was active in the leader of a women's a group on campus and\nYou know we're like why don't we do this it sounds great and it was like why am I not doing it and it took me a minute to ask myself that question and I was like sure let's do that that sounds great [laughter] and then like any good college and I just kinda dove and without really thinking much more about it until until my parents were in the audience\n[laughter] and what was the reaction\nFrom the stage and um I think I was in one of the more funny\nMonologues I couldn't tell you which one it was now it was not the one about period they feel like they're all maybe about period but this was not one about period and um it was one of the more funny ones and I distinctly remember at a laugh line\nLooking at their faces and they were laughing and I knew that we were you know having a home run when I knew that when I saw them enjoying themselves and laughing out loud\nNice [laughter] I Love it [laughter]\nWhere where do we want to go from here we have an election coming up and twenty twenty um you you just you you told me that there are tens of thousands of women who are raising their hand to run for office what are these women what skills are they honing what is what role is emily's list playing for them what what kinds of things um are they being\nTrained in [noise] um\nSo you're right that we have an election twenty twenty we also have a elections even sooner than that we have elections in twenty Seventeen and Virginia and New Jersey um and we have elections and twenty Eighteen so emily's list right now is working with so many women um I think you know this cycle\nWe've already trained hundreds of women the day after the women's march we held a training for five hundred women here in DC and that training was truly a one of the most inspiring things that I've that I've ever been to you know our training\nIs a four hour free training on Saturdays it's meant to be as accessible as possible um and it's really built for anyone who's thinking about running doesn't mean you have to be running today you could be running or thinking about running maybe in five years or ten years\nBut I Would say our training is a wonderful experience because it does too big things first and foremost it is motivational it helps to pull back the curtain on what leadership can look like\nAnd remind women that you know their experience is their expertise\nYou don't need a law degree a policy that you know expertise you don't need 'em\nA background in a legal issues or politics and certainly I think Donald Trump has done anything for women candidates it is certainly been do exposed that you don't have to have run before\nTo get elected and so part of what our training does is really kind of ... highlight the ways in which the many ways in which women can show up for their communities and lead\nAnd then the other piece of our training is tactical you know it really does asked some of those questions that that anyone but especially women I think need to ask themselves a before running for office you know our lives are messy our um days or in the details are lift her long\nAnd so for women I think in that room and that training space part of this is is building out that next step of what you can do moving forward\nKay what pointers do you have for women who want to run for office and what what challenges do you tell them to expect\nA long way [laughter] I'm sure in Lebanon for everyone but there's probably a lot of similarities do yeah there definitely\nAre I'm alleged pointers first and then optical I'm because hopefully I can tell you obstacles and then you know women can just jump right over them yeah um okay so here you know if I was going to tell\nIf you're thinking about running for office here's what I Would say first and foremost um you know think about what is firing you up right now we know that women run for office often to solve a problem in their communities or they're pissed off\nWe're seeing a lot of women right now who are doing both of those um but you have to think about why why you might want to run what is that that issue or that person or that story that you've heard um that's really got you fired up\nSecond thing I Would say is once you've identified that start understanding and looking at yourself and how you're showing up for your community and if you've only you know been tweeting or posting on Facebook about a certain issue or topic that's okay but it's time to take it\nOff line as well and you know showing up could look a lot of different ways for people it could be marching in protesting it could be going to your local um town hall meeting\nCould be calling your representative [noise] um it could be writing op ed that important piece of this next step is that you you start realizing how you're putting your your body where your mouth is so to speak because ultimately if you were going to ask your community to invest in you\nYou need to invest in them the third thing I Would say\nIs this start start posting with purpose right we've been talking a little bit about Twitter and Facebook if you're thinking about taking on a leadership role of Public Leadership role in your community have an active\nAn intentional social media presence that that tells your story in a way that you want it told in the era of fake news there are too many opportunities for other people to tell your story\nOr to or to say things about your potential campaign or to to misrepresent an issue what you need you now if you're thinking about running for office is to bring some specificity unintentional ... to your public kind of a social media persona\nThe force thing I Would say to do is to start talking to people about that you know it doesn't have to remain as secret\nNot you're thinking about running for office this isn't something that you will ever do by yourself running for office takes literally a village um she's one of my favorite Hillary Clinton quote\nYeah um but you will never do this by yourself so so start telling maybe your friends and family if you will you know who love you um and if you start to gauge the reaction you can start to say something like hey I'm thinking about running for office I'm\nAnd she would see what they say and see how that feels when you try it on for the first time he's eventually what\nYou're going to want to do is address Arnie to tell more and more people\nAre you thinking about running or you want to get their input or advice I'm also you want to start building out a list of those people keeping a goal of of um supporters and allies um so the eventually when you do run\nYou have a place to start you have names and emails and phone numbers of people that you can call to for support for money for you know just\nHaving a a team at your disposal and also voters that you're back which is really really important\nAnd the last thing I Will say is you know if you're thinking about running for office\nJust run [laughter] just run you know we talk a lot about training and there are some really great training programs out there including the one like emily's list like I described but if you're ready to go", "show_name": "Inflection Point", "year": "2018", "city":
