uniform\nStill in uniform during the incident that matters according to leave merit he's the lawyer for both ... family who says the family plans to sue not just Geiger but also the city of Dallas\nMerit didn't return Kate Yuri's requests for comment but he's been connecting Geiger his actions to the Dallas police department\nIts opposition to she was operating them of color or state authorities when people saw her in the public they believe they were looking at a police officer and that's critically important because that gives their access that gives her and a lot of ways that forensic treatment to the public\nThat use the phrase Clare state authority and the language at a very important federal civil rights statute forty to you like the sex in Nineteen eighty three\nJennifer Lawrence teaches civil rights law at the University of Texas law school in Austin she says section Nineteen eighty three is the part of federal law that allows people to sue state or local officials for violating their constitutional rights\nThe first step in bringing the lawsuit like this she says is to demonstrate\nThat in the course of undertaking that conduct that uh allegedly caused the violation that they were acting under color of law that they were using their state authority in some way\nBasically that Geiger was acting as a police officer when she shot both John\nThat she was not just a regular person Laurence says there are a number of factors that a court would look at it to make that determination including some that may not be publicly known yet the fact that Geiger was off duty Lawrence says that may not be the most important factor\nA police officer even though officially off duty like clocked out might still be using their official power or using the trappings\nThat their office or using the authority that their position give them to undertake a that actions that are complaining that\nIf the ... lawyer Li merit can establish that Geiger was acting as a cop when she shot both him John\nThen he can argue that she as an agent of the city government deprived John of his constitutional rights daggers attorney hasn't commented on the potential lawsuit he's called the killing a tragic mistake but\nLeave merit says the city of Dallas is also responsible the city declined comment for this story art render says it could be difficult to connect to the city to Geiger actions he's a lawyer in Fort Worth who's tried police misconduct cases\nTo hold her employer the city ... you have to show that there was a custom or policy of unconstitutional actions which the policy directly caused his death\nRender says ... family is legal team might look at her record of discipline and use of force how officers in the department are trained to use force and how they're disciplined if they use too much\nEssentially to prove Dallas's liability they'd have to point to some policy or practice within the department that itself is unconstitutional which Geiger was following and that could have led to John's death\nThe only way Dallas would be responsible is isn't Dallas itself somehow was was responsible for her actions independently of what she did\nBrand or says that's a really high bar and he says these federal civil rights cases can drag on for years all of this happens in federal court by the way because Texas law\nMakes it pretty much impossible to sue governments for any kind of damages in Dallas I'm Christopher Connelly for the Texas standards and you were listening to the Texas standards\n[noise] [noise]\nRoseanne Barr social
