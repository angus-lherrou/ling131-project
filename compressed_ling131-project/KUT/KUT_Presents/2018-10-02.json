lucky you overcome\nAnd here you are so it worked out and buy a okay once again everybody ladies\nAnd gentlemen the debaters arguing and I have resolution\nLet's move on to our first resolution Nico NATO the alliance for number great war with the aim of protecting Western Europe against the Soviet threat but the Soviets are gone and NATO has gone to war in places as far distance from the north Atlantic for which is named as Afghanistan and Libya\nDoes this arrangement still makes sense\nAnd here's how it's going to work for each resolution the debaters will declare in the moment that I ask them what their position is on this yes or no to the statement that I give them on the resolution NATO is no longer fit for purpose Corey shockey to declare yes or no\nI Believe NATO is still sit for a purpose cell and\nThe people who put together the NATO alliance words you know starry eyed college professors arguing and faculty lounge they were the people who had spot World War two\nAnd we're really worried that unless that countries in Europe and the United states banded together we would not be able to anticipate threats essay relatives\nAnd that costs for each has asked and defending our societies can be overwhelming and so the cost sharing and the NATO allies how\nFast prevent the Soviet Union and Russia and other countries from the ... the argument that the United states spends too much on NATO that's true if you look at the entirety of the defense budget but we don't use the entirety of the defense budget for the defense of your at\nWhat we contribute to the defense of Europe is proportional compared to what your ... country the it for their own defense thank you very shocking [noise]\nApproved our next\nDebate or John Mearsheimer John Mearsheimer on the resolution NATO is no longer fit for purpose do you declare yes\nOr no drawn on me yes and I respectfully disagree almost completely with Corey\nI think that when NATO was set up to deal with the Soviet threat it may eminently good sense to create that institution I think that institution did fine job as long as the Soviet Union was their\nSoviet Union however disappeared and therefore I think it's time for the United states to go home of the United states should be pivot to Asia because to the extent that we have\nThreat in the international system we have to deal with it is China but furthermore we're going to spend some of that money we spend on Europe in fixing the subways here in New York subway system is absolutely terrible [noise]\nThe schools\nAre in terrible shape so there's all sorts of reasons for the United states not to spend money defending\nOther people who are perfectly capable of defending themselves the Europeans without the Americans\nHave gross national product\nIt's ten times the size of Russia and they spend five times as much money on defense thank you John Mearsheimer\n[noise] and I figure on the resolution\nNATO is no longer fit for purpose well Marc Gerecht to declare yes or no\nNo yeah I mean I I think NATO obviously should should be off is still serves a purpose or\nIf you go around and we traveled to Europe you talk to the foreign policy crowds and all the European countries rather be on the west or the east you don't even have to go the Baltics republics you won't find anyone\nSaying oh I Wish they had or dead or they believe that Russia is a threat uh and I think they have the grounds\nTo you know I Would also suggest that it's rather important for the United states just to stay in Europe for the Europeans the likelihood of turmoil to Morgan carnage\nIs vastly laugh at last if the Americans stay in fact I Would say it's nonexistent that the Americans say and I think it's a\nDelusional to believe that the Europeans couldn't miss fire again and I don't think that really the amount of money that we spend in Europe on NATO is going to make a hoot worth of difference on the subway system in this city\nUh we're talking about that\nYou go North Carolina [noise] next to argue this resolution\nNATO is no longer fit for a purpose is Derek chalet direct you declare yes or no Jon I declared no a NATO is fit\nFor purpose consider are two strategic rival Russia and China and ask yourself how many wheeling partners do they have countries that they haven't bought off or strong armed in some way\nCountries they believe that an attack on one is an attack against all the answer's no yet for seven decades the United states has enjoyed the partnership and alliance that the day is twenty nine countries strong some of these countries are large summer small they help keep the peace in Europe\nThey're working with American Soldiers today on the ground in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and they're working with US military and confronting the challenges of the future now can working with partners prove time consuming\nAnd frustrating absolutely which is why the alliance needs reforms to make it so faster and more agile and why the Europeans do need to spend more on their defense\nBut that's a far cry from saying that NATO is no longer fit for purpose and needs to be retired if NATO did not exist today we would be racing to invent it\nThank you [noise] our\nFavorite done the right solution\nNATO is no longer fit for a purpose even going to declare yes or no\nWell I live on the upper ... uh west side around the corner by hail from Kentucky so I don't have any liberal lose\nAnd I may be the only person up here actually rises in New York subway every day\nBut the question is different looming over this debate is something hasn't yet been mentioned they all lost his status purpose with the Soviet Union in very quickly found them out expanding from Germany all the way to literally on Russia's borders\nWhat's the result they tell us\nIt brought security where's this security\nWhen it's brought instead is a new and more dangerous Cold War because this Cold War has its epicenter not in faraway Berlin but right on Russia's borders along the way it's generated three American Russian proxy wars Georgia Ukraine Syria\nWith another one ruling in the Boston area\nSteven Cohen they're

today we have five panelists debating a series of different resolutions on the theme of us national security before the break we heard opening statements on the first resolution NATO is no longer fit for purpose\nLet's have some discussion we have a three nose on this resolution and these nose or actually\nA reverse negative in this case those those are actually supportive of NATO and we have to us as which are very skeptical of NATO what I heard on this conversation so far has a lot of focus on Russia before that the Soviet Union and the security of Europe but I Want to point out that NATO is also operating in Afghanistan and Kosovo and in the Mediterranean\nThese are these things have nothing to do with Europe that says I don't know if you would call this mission creep or what else\nBut car I Want you to take on that aspect of NATO's being fit for purpose what is its purpose if it's not a limited to the security of Europe\nSays one thing all of US military operations you named have in common is that it was the United states who dragged our European allies into participating in them so one reason that NATO is set for a purpose as thick as it is the way we organize\nBut the fact that we're provoking them in Eastern Europe and than other places just makes it possible that those nuclear weapons will be used and that's something we want to avoid at all costs thing to join Russia\n[noise] though Russia threat\nIs overblown well Marc Gerecht you declare yes or no no\nI mean I I'm a bit of a split decision on this one up first I mean I think the threat is easily manageable or if it's particularly if we maintain NATO I think of NATO goes down then Russia's ah problems of loom large\nI Will just say this I mean if if you have an individual a dictator who was sending a military intelligence agents out into small cities in Great Britain and letting loose nerve agents that's a problem or\nIf you had a Russian [noise] washes\nSenator that is a health thing and they saw her of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Syrians that is a problem\n[noise] and I think\nPeople tend to make light of what's going on in Syria is a vast humanitarian tragedy a black American food and that helped save Assad\nAnd I think he is making a play for power now and the other side I agree with John ah I think the whole notion of the Russian electoral interference in I'd say is vastly overblown I find it very boring well thanks very much\nFor your time is that [noise]\n[noise] finally to speak\nIn an opening round on this resolution to Russia thread is overblown direct chalet you declare yes or no\nNo and that's because white Americans Russia has a clear set of strategic goals\nTo divide the U.S from Europe to undermine NATO to support liberal and nationalist politics and to weaken the United states and our democratic partners around the world are undermining the very foundations of our democracies by spreading disinformation fomenting dissent\nNow in some of these goals Russia sixty fun others it's not\nBut it would be strategic malpractice for us not to take this seriously and simply dismiss this threat is overblown\nThat said I agree with some of my colleagues here I Do not believe that Russia is the greatest challenge the United states and the twenty first century but Russia's weakness doesn't diminish the threat in many ways Russia's weakness makes the direct worse\nCausing Moscow to take greater risks and seek new nefarious ways that it can achieve it seems we need to take this threat seriously think actually I'm actually\nAnd let's look at the flags now we have to nose and three us is on the resolution the Russia threat is overblown\nI wouldn't want to just throw into the mix here is the fact that right now Russia is deli in with China ah and certainly to tweet us ... maneuvers in the Mediterranean together very recently and other contacts between them whether you think we provoke the way the U.S provoked it or not how is this not a threat at this point\nRight now you've formulated I mean for historical and political reasons not entirely due to bad and Barack and policy\nChina's moment in the sun is coming Russia has to decide where it's going to be in this order or the old order is falling apart new one is emerging whether we like it or not we don't dismiss it as a kind of push is anti American or move on Russian it's driven by powerful factors\nOf Crimea is usually given as ... original sin\nI don't think you could find the word Crimea in any of these talks are interest all\nForeign policy priorities in to the United states are better than the overthrow of the legitimately elected and whatever rotter who might have been president of Ukraine in February two thousand and fourteen well I mean there's a history of these provocations\nThis real well there's there are sort of don't control the first part of a of of Stevens arguments\nThat putting grabbed Crimea does that strengthen your arguments or do you find Stevens' argument persuasive\nNo I don't find it persuasive I mean I I Do think dictatorships hang together there is a reason why China and Russia and Iran and made an alliance\nThey are they wrong oppressive society is when they have the common denominator that they all really don't like the United states terribly much and what is striking to me is when I listened to boot and I mean I understand why the Supreme leader of around likes\nHim he sounds like it it's the same type of lexicon that they use\nTo describe their common enemy so that I I think it's just missed place to talk about this real is for tens of somehow we're going to build or an alliance with\nThe Russians it's not going to happen because they don't want it to happen if you were to actually have a thriving\nDemocratic society develop I Know that seems like a million miles off and Ukraine kill to\nGet that I mean that's what's striking to me is is how it becomes America's\nFault that the people of central and Eastern Europe want\nThe United states closer to them and want to be protected from Russia the several thousand troops the U.S may be rotating through the Baltics is just a small fraction of the Russian divisions that are lined up on their border and after Ukraine would they all thought is this could be coming to a theater\nNear us soon John Mearsheimer\nYeah I just want to say that the United states has the Monroe Doctrine and the Monroe Doctrine says that no distant great power a year great power from Europe or East Asia\nIs allowed to move military forces into the western hemisphere in form of military alliance with the country in our hemisphere it makes eminently good sense for the United states\nRussia being a great power has its own version of the Monroe Doctrine and it was our movie of NATO up to the border and saying that Ukraine and Georgia would become part of NATO that led to the Georgia war in two thousand eight and listen to the war over Ukraine in\nTwo thousand five hundred dollars worth of Ukrainians were in the ... and give us bringing fourteen ... we heard earlier in this discussion [noise] the charge of\nRussa phobia that Russa phobia is off the charts what\nAbout that I agree that we are more worried about the Russians and building them into a bigger threat than they actually are ...\nThat that is a natural reaction to Russia's bad behavior they poison to people in the streets of Great Britain and they're they're doing the kinds of things that are making country more incredibly anxious more than two is that a threat to the U. S. security\nBecause if they will do it in Britain and what not to hear what the Russians are doing is citing asymmetric sat at chase picking away at area says unprotected a\nWestern dominance sessions media poisoning the kinds of things that makes them feel intimidating and that's why there's this strong rest I saw the building that gets people rightly ss\nThat flat in putting this Russia is among line after in the world\nAnd that includes discussion of this resolution to Russia threat of\nA [noise] when\nThird and final motion on the topic of national security where we ask is it time to take a hard line on Iran to stay with us\nFrom the mid term elections are approaching and with so much going on in the world including your own world\n\nIt can be hard to say caught up feeling out of the loop all things considered\nHas the news you need to know and the context you need to stay up to speed to listen to all things considered to secure the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News [noise]\nTune into all things considered tomorrow starting out four pm right here on K U T Ninety point five\nSupport comes from ... celebrating twenty three years of authentic Mexican cuisine often an featuring the newest member of the ... family kind of an adult tequila available at local liquor stores and it ...
