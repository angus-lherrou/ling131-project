story in America this very very strong Stark's fifty fifty divide you get the left and the right and what we did was essentially we conducted what's called a segmentation analysis where we use people's responses\nTo try to clustered them or group them into various segments of like minded individuals\nAnd and what we find is that very differently from the kind of fifty fifty split you get we actually see seven different groups will\nBe called tribes that are characterized in the American population of very intense so and you get ... huge variety of of different points of view that are very very different from that sort of fifty fifty split\nYou know it's interesting there's fifty fifty split echoes ... you know red state blue state right yeah right exactly so so let's let's touch them these uh seven different tribes did I understand you to say\nYes that's right exactly so so you know on the left side for instance on them from the most ideologically left side you have progressive activists I'm traditional liberals and then all the way on the very on the more right hand side you have groups like the devoted conservatives and um traditional conservatives\nSo what does this tell us about our political process which you know has been pretty much ado wobbly for ... of modern American history\nYeah I mean what you know for for us one of the biggest insights was the idea that what you know what you often hear and what is probably the leading to this perception of there being a fifty fifty split or this red state blue state sets in America right now is it the the the wing groups the ones that are the most extreme are\nAlso the most vocal and the most active so they're dominating the conversation but what we found is what we called it an exhausted majority of group that makes up two thirds of the American population that's very much more towards the center of the ideological divide now that doesn't mean that they're all centrist they have flexible use\n'em and some of them are more to the right some of them are more to the left but they are characterized by first of all a flexibility in their in their political points of view and also\nI'm a desire and exhaustion with the amount of polarization that they're seeing in America and then finally a sense that they're not heard from in the normal political debate and so this group is potentially one of the sources of reconciliation to move forward pastor polarization in America right now\nBut I mean that sounds wonderful but how do you put wheels on this in in reality because there have been efforts to to have third parties which have gone\nA will not very far shall we say uh and and and there are a lot of political scientist who will say you're you're naive to think that there's a way past this beyond that to party a process that we have\nYeah it's true I mean the thing is though what you're getting from that group\nEven though at the same time all people are saying that this is among them the most polarized America has ever been in their lifetimes for instance nine out of ten Americans are saying this is the most polarizing has been in their America has ever been in their lifetimes at the same time\nThere is a sense of hope and optimism Seventy seven three quarters of people also think that there is a path that can move our country forward if we can find the right language to encourage a sense of understanding and humanity on both sides of the political divide\nDaniel ... is associate director of research for the nonprofit organization more in common

David\nMentioned this earlier interesting story a tweet from and democratic candidate for U.S House Mike Segal has gone viral after one of his campaign workers was arrested during a disagreement about students voting yeah so yeah so here's the tweet it says that Wednesday quote\nOne of my regional field director who was arrested in Waller county while delivering a letter to the county judge the letter demanding immediate action to protect the voting rights of students at prairie view a and M. university so am I unpack here so let's start beginning I suppose Segal is challenging\nIncumbent representative Michael McAllen, Texas district in race that's the creatively drawn district that stretches from west often down to the Houston suburbs around there but that was yeah yeah and it's in that Houston area where all this went down ... review and M. university is\nApparently in the midst of a disagreement over the correct address students voters have to put down on their registration\nForms long story short it sounds like stupid people that are registered with one of these two addresses they were told to use will be allowed to vote on campus and then they may be required to fill out a change of address form a prior to voting or during a very interesting yeah so this field director for going to deliver a letter to the wall or county judge denouncing that decision is likely\nTo create confusion and long lines on voting day and that's where things got nasty according to a single press release the field director photograph the delivery of the letter to the clerk\nApparently the clerk took some on bread with being photographed as what I read somewhere and at this point he was prevented from leaving law enforcement arrived and ask them who he was working and what party he was with\nAnd soon after standing he was with the Democratic party he was arrested and now he was arrested yes he is arrested and apparently put a again part of the press release from the Mike Segal campaign put on like a forty eight hour hold\nHe was released after just approximately two hours in custody and charged with a misdemeanor for failure to identify and his tone or was also confiscated so\nLater he was a lot of questions yeah I'll say I mean is there a ... D I presume the reason for taking the photograph and the first place was to have proof fruit and delivery at ... and delivered is there's some rule there's some ordinance that says you can't have a ... you can make a cell\nPhone yeah your guess is as good as mine that I wouldn't be surprised if this is litigated a bit further obviously and it's a it's like I said it's a become viral for the sequel campaign I think that to his tweets been shared about six hundred\nAre so uh and lots of folks are talking about a Jew Jew Jones she raises unimportant\nA bit of background information here that this transpired\nOr at Purdue University a historically black colleges virus the inside of the ah Sandra Bland a tragedy where she was found dead in jail after being detained for that traffic stop what a stone yeah\nGee where's where it's one that continues unfold on social media and we want to know what's making news in Europe ... feel free to tweet us ...

fun\nIt is easier than at any time in our history to build a healthy diet if you notice about four and if you're willing to take the time to prepare food but it's also the case that it's never been easier to build an unhealthy diet as well because unhealthy food is so easily available at so inexpensive it's\nA it literally every corner and so I think that's the challenge that we face\nEasily overlooked link between the foods we choose to eat and how healthy we feel you're listening to a human kind special Mt Hood for\nIt's an obvious use some of them sometimes disregard to our detriment\nView we put into our body the foods we eat have a profound impact on our health point of view on a reliability to fend off disease\nSalads offer it easy to make bounty of vegetables especially when they include nutrient rich dark leafy greens like spinach and kale along with other veggies\nHostile or rice dishes and soups or additional ways to work in super healthy vegetables

dietary guidelines for Americans recommend that most of us eat three to four servings of vegetables a day\nOr two to three servings of fruit in addition to beans and whole grains but the Centers for Disease Control and prevention reported recently did just won the intent Americans\nIs actually eating enough of these foods\nA problem is that fruits and vegetables are expensive uh we subsidize commodity crops like corn and soy which is why high fructose corn syrup and find soybean oil are cheap and universally president and in junk food we don't subsidize fruits and vegetables so they're out of the reach of many people who are poor in this country\nAnd the food deserts\nAbsolutely uh now I make a distinction fruits and vegetables because fruits or sugar sources and I don't think you'd want to eat fruits with abandon and you want to learn which fruits are lower in glycine the globe like Barry's for example an apples and cherries as opposed to tropical fruits and watermelon and grapes\nBut vegetables I find that a problem is that many people don't know how to prepare them or they say it's too much trouble too much time and they don't know how to what to do with them\nThey find boiled vegetables to be bland\nRight I hate it a lot of vegetables growing up ... never had them prepared properly you know all the broccoli I got was yellow green and mushy a Brussels sprouts were cook to death and smelled horrible uh you know same with beets and I mean I remember many institutional cafeterias that I needed\nA including at Harvard Medical school where the vegetables were just horrible\nSo people kind of been turned off by their experience with food's not well enough ... yeah\nYeah than let's say a in addition to anti accidents is um minerals you know vegetables are your best source of minerals and the diet um we know that in the United states people most people don't get enough potassium they don't get enough magnesium\nAnd this could be remedied by eating enough vegetables um I Know I crave vegetables I really uh crave a salads I crave a\nA well prepared a roasted vegetables um and um\nPeople haven't been taught to cook in general and cooking vegetables as maybe a little higher than cooking steak can really put salt and pepper and you put it on the grill and it's probably going to be edible and then you may have similar ... or ... or something like that that you could add to it [noise]\nUm and I do think there's a little bit more knowledge required to a preparer vegetables in a tasty way a but it's very very learn a ball\nIf we do adjust our food preparation habits to incorporate more vegetables and fruits for health is there not also risk of harmful effects from pesticides and other chemicals used in crops that are grown non organically physician alley coercion based in Princeton New Jersey\nI work with on many populations\nI'm not just people who can afford organics I work and insist you economically challenged communities and mothers and families that do not have access or finances or even the knowledge regarding some of these choices\nSo I actually try to make sure that people have options other than organics um I certainly think that that's the best way to go you can do that and there's even frozen organics now that are cheaper than fresh organic that are just as good you know nutrient life\nUm but I I often recommend people I'm looking into whatever resources like environmental working cribs dirty dozen clean team which is a wonderful resource\nUm which shows you know ... year late an annual evaluations of\nUnconventional which means non organic produce um and whether or not they had the greatest amount of pesticide residues versus that we can out and said that not that list changes up every year but generally carry some of the same ... tend to be the highest in terms of the most recipes\nUm tested yearly um so that's one option for people who can't afford ... organics they can certainly go off that list\nAnd you can talk to farmers and find out what their personal practices are even if they're not organic\nAnd you can grow your own food and then I said can wash it produce in a way that helps to reduce the traffic is using say one part vinegar to three parts clean warm water on and agitating that ... you can really take a decent amount of them which is off and

movement is gaining you among many Americans process fast food generates about two hundred billion dollars a year served it more than two hundred thousand to fast food restaurants that's not by accident Dr Andrew Weil\nThis history of Americans being told that manufactured food was somehow better for them or you know I think this happened in the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties one's a number of these these processed foods came when the market if they were seen as the modern and up to date and as well as labor saving\nSome talk about easy plus she just pops he they tried to get as hot of you know there are other ready and individual heat 'n serve trade you just said and survive you serve big hardy was ran ... gravy\nFresh peas more butter mother Murphy\nIf you look at fast food and particular it is remarkable to me that when you put American fast food down anywhere in the world people gravitate toward it I did a lot of research for healthy aging in Okinawa, Okinawa has some of them\nKnow has the highest longevity in the world and among those interesting very diets they're great profusion of land vegetables see vegetables\nA fish and all sorts of things\nAre in the years that I made a number of visits to Okinawa over about seven years and then the time of economic longevity plummeted especially among men was attributed entirely to the rapid popularity of American type fast food or\nSomething and the combination of fat salt and crunch which they are so fast food apparently have mastered seemed to carry widespread appeal even when Cerf stuff in ways that can damage our help\nAnother issue which is often not discussed is that over the past fifty Seventy years uh and the taste of food has declined as we as a result of\nA dependence and agriculture on very limited number of varieties like the red delicious apple for example or breeding of chickens for a rapid weight gain at the expense of flavor and in response to this loss of flavor in food\nThere has grown up a multi billion dollar industry in flavor additives are and these are and everything and we don't know some of these chemicals are natural some of them are synthetic summer somebody synthetic\nBut we really know nothing about the facts are alone or in combination they're not listed on the labels are just conceal among the general head and you know flavors and spices\nUm but they could have very profound effect once as we all do every one of the drivers of obesity in America\nAnd or national weight problem poses a serious public health concern according to the CDC Ninety three million Americans are about four in ten or obese\nHealth consequences can include heart disease stroke type two diabetes and certain kinds of cancer estimated annual medical costs to the United states is one

some of us quietly\nGrown at the prospect of a nutritious diet as if it requires sacrificing the foods we really like\nPhysicians and author Andrew wile founded the center for integrative medicine at the University of Arizona give\nPeople the experience of eating delicious tasting food that's healthy and it was just something that I've tried to do all all my life is to convince people that\nThere is no opposition between food that's good and food that's good for you most people think eating healthy means giving up everything you want and it's absolutely not true it is possible to get tremendous pleasure out of all foods and dietary patterns that conform to good nutritional science\nAnd that would probably cheer old hypocrisy is he lived about twenty five hundred years ago in Greece was admired by his contemporaries like the philosopher played\nHippocrates was the legendary physician generally regarded as the father if western medicine you famously commented lip food ... medicine and medicine food\nBut how relevant does this ancient observation today I asked several nutrition experts including Tufts University researchers Susan Roberts\nSo I think food is hugely important to health you know it's one of the few things that you can control them yourself you can't control your genes Yukon controlled environment\nThe position that you can control what you put in your math and and all the evidence shows and ... and that's just more and more evidence that the time that had we had a profound effect on health you know throughout life\nAnd for some twenty first century doctors like University of Arizona medical school professor Andrew wile that venerable incited hypocrisy still permeates the examining all\nWhen I write treatment plans for patients almost always the first element that I write is about dietary change and I train other physicians to do that and I've often seem dietary change produced\nA dramatic cures resolutions of problems long standing um and it hasn't been tried before ...\nKnown factor in this discussion is the prevalence of meat and the western diet and many of\nUs significantly overestimate the amount of protein and actually required by the human body in fact there are\nDangers in consuming too much for the federal dietary guidelines which are updated every five years now recommend that particularly men and boys about half the population should reduce their protein intake\nBut American meat eating is on the rights\nAverage consumers are on track to eat more than two hundred pounds of red meat and poultry per year\nI think people in this culture eat too many animal products ah I don't tell people to become complete vegetarians but I think it'd be very useful for most people to reduce their consumption of animal foods is very solid research showing that\nAh the more red meat that people eat the increase in all cause mortality\nI'm an beef is a particular problem that we eat too much too much of a but I think we're very useful for people to substitute vegetables protein for some of the animal protein\nSuch as come in beans\nBeans which are wonderful foods they're cheap there ah you know full of fiber vitamins they're a good source of\nProtein and slowed adjusting carbohydrate which doesn't affect blood sugar the way that products made with Lauer do\nBut health recommendations like that must compete with the power of the marketplace where the primary aim is profit not promoting our will be with domestic meat consumption at one hundred billion pounds per year livestock production is a huge business\nIt would really help if the government subsidized fruits and vegetables and lower the cost of them you know you go into a if you're on a a an Indian reservation in this country and going to grocery stores and soup or is there it's awful what's available we produce if there's there's hardly anything there and what's there as will didn't awful looking\nAt the same thing in poor neighborhoods in this country are you know the fact is that that\nMany people can't afford fruits and vegetables and the government could easily you can't have the government telling us eat more fruits and vegetables and at the same time you know working to make the cheap commodity foods\nAvailable we we we have made the unhealthy foods cheapest and most available people eat well just cheapen wants of al and vegetables and fruits are simply out of the price range of many people\nAt the same time America has long had a strong fascination with high end cuisine\nAnd this one is a caffeine a duck had today and if you make one of these concoction Z in the dish which is called the caffeine and Fitch it's already being\nAn issue unless it like this one that just like to say but they're somewhat interchangeable and sales of cookbooks\nAre at an all time high and audiences for cooking shows on television are off the charts and fewer people are working the number so people must be using these cookbooks as coffee table or bathroom reading\nAnd uh the TV shows or entertainment doesn't translate into what's being done at home the statistics that I've seen on how few American families sit down to even one\nHome cooked meal in a week or pretty dismal why do you think that's happening [noise] well\nI I you you people say they don't have time to cook that's a major one or it's too much trouble or they don't know how to do it that it's beyond them and I think in some ways the cooking shows reinforced that that it makes it looks as if this is the realm of professional chefs who have all this knowledge\nAnd it'd be very exotic\nYeah has to be very exotic I'm One of our initiatives that are center is to figure out how to get more people back into the kitchen cooking and to show people you know it is possible to learn how to make quick simple easy\nInexpensive dishes that are healthy and you can make these in quantity that will ask for a week you don't have to master a whole huge number of them if you can get like four or five recipes down that you like and then share them with other people on the other people inspired that would be a very good trend

what most of us would encourage you to be helpful and one of the things that I remind\nPeace or a list just to clarify ten servings a day to\n... to ... that sounds like an insane amount and play you a member of what a serving sizes which we often also have a distorted ... big apple big granny apple might be two servings of fruit\nAnd a large salad like you might get with lunch could be five servings if it's a big salad or three or four if it's a smaller salad and so\nUm yeah I I Know a lot of health conscious people wear a salad with some protein is one of their meals either lunch or dinner and that's the way of getting a lot of vegetables and fruits you probably have\nTo have some at every meal to make this work so I personally like to have my breakfast I Know people eat vegetables with their breakfast\n\n\n\nWe're exploring the health effects of the foods we choose to eat out freezing or intake of vegetables and fruits can cut our risk of developing serious medical
