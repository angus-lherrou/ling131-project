{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Border patrol and customs sort of moving into the interior of the country and sort of away from the border just because we had so many more agents out there\nDescribe for us if you will as a practical matter how this manifests I think a lot of us who've been down to south Texas you're on your way back and you see a checkpoint this will within the interior of the state uh\nUh for example right\nRight and and and we're familiar with that in Texas not so much in other states that I'm border patrol actually has a zone within a hundred miles where they can set up checkpoints\nAnd they can actually do roving patrols beyond that hundred miles and actually in the course of reporting this story what they told me as they're not really India graphically limited\nUh their authority to arrest entertain people and the thing that is unique about them is that they were given these towers um after World War two\nTo search detain people just based on reasonable suspicion instead of probable cause which is a higher standard that's under the uh the constitution to protect people from unlawful searches and seizures so they have a lower\nThreshold Herschel from being able to detain people and the case that I highlight is in the story is really at worst case scenario\nWell let's talk about this particular uh example where I interviewed\nYeah so this one of the U. S. citizen and uh she's actually from New Mexico but she had gone over to ... to visit a friend who had just lost his wife and she was coming back across the border or in El Paso and waiting for them to swipe her passport and the agent said you know\nWe want you to go through a more like a secondary inspection than another agent brought one of those drug sniffing dogs ...\nAnd apparently that agent said that the dog had alerted to her that she might possibly have you know drugs on her or something like that so then they said you know we're gonna have to take you to a secondary inspection inside and it's going to be more intensive so they took her inside and they did like\nA strip search and you know they put it through all this stuff and they found no evidence of contraband or drugs or anything like that\nBut even so they didn't put her in a car and go over to a hospital in El Paso\nAnd then subjected to her to a series of cavity search is um [noise] a CAT scan an X ray\nAnd uh then they wanted her to give them she ... they wanted her consent to do it or after the fact and they had no warrant and then they said you know if you don't sign the consent forms and we're going to believe for all this\nAnd she said well I'm not signed you know I didn't get my consent so sure enough she got started getting bills could nine fifty four hundred dollars for all the procedures that they wanted her to pay she ended up at the ACLU and\nDid do the case and and she actually did end up winning\nWhy is there no pushback considering how many people are caught in this zone\nI think in the past it was overlooked because the thought was well this these are people who are not citizens or it's just the border I think there needs to be a conversation would be nice and Congress about the kind of authorities that they do have and if they should be updated and may be reformed you know\nIt certainly seems likely to be ... conversations the article checkpoint nation by Melissa do busking

I was in yet another crisis I'm and I'm\nAnd I was very seriously considering you know a ... do I stay here or\nShould I actually moved to the next life because I'm not quite sure oh whether I can endure this and I'm ... and so I wrote to a we have time for this story\nThis is a good story I mean before you're still paying for here how you found ties\nHow I found that [noise] um so I was not you know just absolute horrible prices truly truly wondering you know should I should I stay here or should I\nMove on help myself to move on and um and I wrote to a friend in Costa Rica wrote him an email and I said uh I'm having a really hard time I'm having serious suicidal thoughts um and I just need to do something so he writes back and he goes what do you want to do and\nOut out of nowhere I have no idea where the word Buddhism came into something like Buddhist and he goes Buddhism what do you know about Buddhism nothing [noise] I don't even know how it's spelled [laughter]\nI Need it and he goes okay let me see if I can find something and I'm so he sent me a link and it was ties monastery in Germany and it was forty five minutes from my house and I said I could do that\nAnd so then I went you know engaging with these people are who have no idea what was going on but you know can I come and I know that it's full and did it at all and they said well first of all are you a man or woman I said well I'm a woman because they separate right\nUm and they said okay that's good we have one room laugh if you're a woman um but it's on the fourth floor and there is no elevator can you do that and I said you know what I Will walk up twenty four hours just to give me a place to come\nAnd ties teaching saved my life and they really did they saved my life um and honestly they are um\nAlso the guidance that I used bought that I saw emerging very quickly and how we brought everyone together under the Paris Agreement\n... quiet source of calmness and energy with other people are ... even from Buddhist countries or Asian nations or did you keep it two years so\nNow I kept it to myself because I'm\n... because we were working in a very into cultural inter faith in church national um space and I did not want the fact that something that had touched me so deeply and had been so meaningful to me\nTo be interpreted as an imposition on anyone else I mean this was good for me but\nUm everyone who was there was being held by something else so\nIt was it was certainly my guidance and the light and in my life but it didn't have to be everybody else's but would it did help me was to maintain an inordinate amount of calm in moments of total crisis in the negotiations\nBut also if I can I can tell one more story because I think it illustrates\nHow these teachings that I mean to me they came to tie but frankly I Believe they are golden teachings\nThat are at the root of every single spiritual practice every single one it just happens that the vehicle to me was through this but they are golden principles and\nOne of the ones that I saw\nUnpacking the difficulty in the negotiations was the understanding of the dynamic between being a victim and being a perpetrator\nAnd through the study of ties teachings I began to see myself as having um\nExperience myself as a victim for many many years\nA as a victim of a very difficult childhood as a victim or in my marriage a as a ... to ... to ... and of course everybody who sees me up there goes like Christiana a victim ... Oh yes because we all have this right we all do ourselves as victims in some way\nAnd I realized wow okay so if I see myself as a victim what that actually means independently of the reality or whatever it which is frankly unreality\nBut what that means is that if I Am sleeping myself as a victim I Am immediately labeling somebody else as a perpetrator what was that an awakening right\nOn I went down ... ... ... to ...\nI I Can't do that I cannot label somebody else as a perpetrator\nAnd then if you think about it one step farther that person can use you as an example if I say right I'm a victim and Greg is my perpetrator right what you're going to do with that\nIs you're not going to sit on that you're going to immediately turn it around and said no no no no no I'm not a perpetrator I've actually done this because I Am a victim of something prior right\nBecause so you hurt me today well but the reason that I heard just because you ... me the day before yesterday and I know I did not because you know I'm pretty soon you're three hundred years back right [noise]\nAnd ... and you you engage in this seesaw of victim perpetrator and everybody is a victim and perpetrator if you engage in that die and dynamic you are a victim and perpetrator at different points in time with different people with different situation\nAnd you're into this your whole life\nAnd and I saw that happening in the negotiations I sign happening with developing country\nDeveloping countries whose representatives were absolutely convinced that they are victims they are objectively victims\nThis is the climate one conversation about using mindfulness employment action\nGreg is speaking with Christiana figures of mission twenty Twenty years two terms as executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change\nAnd helped to broker the dark twenty to the Paris climate [noise]\n... now joined by make levy and Josh Friedman\nLevy isn't or Danes and peace with the San Francisco Zen center\nAnd a senior teacher with the emotional intelligence programs search inside yourself [noise]\nFriedman is a CEO of six seconds the emotional intelligence networks [noise]\nHere's their conversation [noise]\nReg let's begin with reflections on what you've heard Chris John of say you were sitting listening to her ... really coming forward for you listening to the store\nAnd I appreciate it so much but she shared but also towards the end when she was talking about um the vision or how we approach these issues uh what I've been thinking about recently you know having taught mindfulness in a secular version\nAnd companies et cetera and for the last ten years or so that I'm seeing how it's evolving and there's something called the fourth foundation of mindfulness which isn't talked about very much which ... there are many things involved in that but one is what is the vision\nIs the framing in which you you look at the world and I think it's very important Buddhism actually in some ways was quite radical\nAnd then it asks us to look very deeply at him permanence at change and also at interconnectedness\nWhat happens if we really take that on as how we see the world and that part of the minds on this piece is remembering that\nNot just oh I'm doing my mind from this practice as you go to the world are you seeing that are you knowing that are you realizing that it's not just me and my separate self that has to be protected or my en route we are actually deeply vastly interconnected\nBack connectedness Josh or even your your reflections on what Christiana presented to us today\nFirst I could just listen to her all day yeah hush her passion and an insight and\nA presence was but it's just remarkable\nUm I just wanted to continue with the theme of optimism and that the notion that optimism doesn't mean denying reality optimism is not the same as like positive thinking let's just put on a smile optimism is confronting the challenges that we have\nIt's being willing to acknowledge that pain that we might be feeling others that might be feeling the brutal difficulty of a situation\nAnd knowing we are going to find options knowing even if I Can't see the option right now I Know that we can find some we can make some\nThat's optimism and so when we can enter into the situation of something like\nA Paris and Ford said the biggest moral crisis facing humanity of climate change and we can say\nThis is incredibly painful there's so much despair and suffering around these issues and we're going to find a way that's optimism and I think Chris Jonah role model that frustrate beautifully\nMeg whether you know Buddhism begins with that life is suffering so\nI'm thinking about climate change okay I really don't know um and you also said you know you mentioned I Am separate but there's also this this um illusion perhaps that I have controls to talk about the separation in control of a self\nSuppression and control of well first of all just to the the the suffering nice and it's a difficult translation ah the the word actually is Duke out which is related to the idea of of of wheel that isn't quite set right\nSo there's sort of like ... ... ... and the fact that if we are out of alignment\nWith understanding how things actually function which is I was talking a minute ago that things are dynamic and moving connected to that and we're trying to hold on to pretend they're not then there's that that sense that there's things aren't writes things are we're never going to get them right so it's stepping back\nFrom that in a way um and in terms of control its\nIts went out of control\nWent under control and that that's part of it and we're not who we think we are\nNo matter what we do\nYou know we were talking earlier that are\nIn this is just personally for me very helpful to realize that no matter what we do and about seven and a half billion years\nThey have all gonna be gone anyway right it's all going to change it all the sun will expand the earth will be gone just like ourselves so so Buddhism also asked us to look like okay my own personal death if I really take that in how does that actually free me\nYou know to actually be with a pain but also the the joy that compassionate connection is there a way that if we really see we can't really hold on to this it's impossible\nAnd how do we take care of it than that freeze the action and its interconnected how we all emerging that\nSo there's this idea and and climate that that sort of were attached to 'em [noise] you know the glaciers to Christianity talked about the coral reefs that are dying and every generation kind of has a a reset for what the natural landscape was I mean imagine if you're on a lonely and you came\nTo the indigenous people that occupy San Francisco and you came to us now from what you've had remembered it\nWould you be wild with wonder would you be aghast at what has been done paved over to that beautiful landscape you know so I guess what I'm getting at is can detachment if we can detaching as an way does that mean we can\nLessen the pain of the last the climate is bringing to us\nSo I think you can see better to the Buddhist part of this but why do we need to detach from the pain mhm I think we're so\nIn our society we're actively seeking comfort mhm\nAnd you know whether that's on our phones or whether that shopping or whether that's you know what we drink or what if it's okay to be\n... to to experience the despair and at the very same time you know we look outside here and can we hold those two things at once it gets so beautiful it's such a gift to be on this planet\nAnd we have this pair and those two things that don't cancel each other out they're not ... not a paradox kits what's the word anyway they don't they don't and race each other you know I couldn't really mad at my wife and her like crazy at the same moment [noise]\n... yeah right yeah\nI Do agree with you you know and and I've also been um moved hearing people talk about how do we\nHow do we actually turn towards that towards toward the toward torn turn towards the pain that in part of that you can see how much you care field but the compassion what's there and and underneath it's the love and so how do we actually start to\nPractice through that well and Christiana shared that with us she felt to her knees in pain\nWhich galvanized her to do something impossible\nRight in ... I mean I think if instead of hiding from our emotions would just say hey these are teachers\nTo help us figure out what's really important for us and for the world\nJosh you've done some research or where some research about how um people Americans are afraid and more lonely than ever\nSo I'm Sorry to say it's a global uh we humanity is more afraid and more lonely than ever in recorded research now probably there are other times in history when people have really been suffering but nobody was taking the balls [noise] um [noise]\nWhat is that doing to\nOur relationships or ability to connect our ability to solve the problems that are in front of us our ability to form a court\nRight and the Christian talked about look being able to look for it at our shared responsibility and when we're in that state of loneliness and fear those are actually really valuable feelings the really important teachers yet if we stay only in that it's like we only listen to this one loud voice\nIt's going to be really hard for us to do the work of connecting across different about finding that shared compassion about finding the courage inside ourselves to actually listen to each other\nSo I think what it means is just as the seas are getting heavier Caesar\nRising literally the emotional fees are rising and that means we have to work\nRight and that's what my phone is practice is all about mhm site it's preparing ourselves\nAnd I think that disconnection from from each other is not unrelated turned disconnection with the world and uh and the wider system as well and when when evolution I'm also seeing is mindfulness I'm\nOriginally seen as a individual practice you know my own focus et cetera and realizing more and more I Know it's it's a mindful ecosystem you know even in his even a secular way and that this is not a new idea", "year": "2018", "show_name": "KUT Presents", "city": "Austin", "day": "16"}
