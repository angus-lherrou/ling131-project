{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "You know I think for every text than this report matters because no matter what issue we care about\nI don't believe that we can solve are eight major challenges and left the investing young Latino letters because they are going to be such an important political force in our state as you mentioned wanting to people under the age of Eighteen or like you know over the next decade two million Latinos are going to turn Eighteen and become eligible to vote\nAnd they are critical to improving our states embarrassing standard as being one of the least likely to vote in the country\nWell there you just touched on something that's really important here I mean I Know you talk to more than a thousand plus young people about why they don't vote and what did you come up with\nWell you know they had their reasons about\nThat they didn't necessarily trust politician but they didn't feel that their votes mattered um but when it really came down to the qualitative energy is that we did with young people many said they wanted to vote but\nThey didn't have information and the truth is that we also found in other studies have shown that even the majority of Latinos say they want to well most of them will never be contacted by campaign or candidate\nI Want to I Want to ask you about this because this study identifies four major reasons that uh these young people gave you for not voting one of them is cynicism could you talk about that just a bit\n[noise] yeah we found that a lot of young Latinos in fact have felt cynical about politics they didn't feel like their vote mattered that they didn't feel like their voice was heard from this study we found that respondents cared about legalizing marijuana\nCanceling student debt health care for all and of course immigration but most candidates when they talk the Latino community if they talk to them at all [noise] mostly talk to them about immigration so they're really nothing to mark\nSomething else there was a bit of a surprise young people told you that that they don't feel educated enough to vote is is it an issue of self perception does this get back to being courted by the candidates or not being courted by the ... what does that mean they they don't feel educated enough to vote\nYeah we found that many people felt that they didn't know who the candidates where are the differences between the parties um and I think that what they're really troubling sign that there was a lot more our government could be doing and the major parties could be given to educate people about where they stand on the issues that matter to Latino voters I'm so that they can make informed that\nThis does any of this have to do with whether you're first generation or second generation I mean does it break down that way\nYeah you know I'm an interesting theory and I had that same theory we actually pulled data to see if they're what the difference between someone like me a child of immigrants where someone that was at the generation Texan and they're voting participation and we actually found that there was\nNot a different um but what was consistent as for example let me not so much higher percentages especially younger Latina and our male counterparts yeah why is winds that\n[noise] you know we don't know quite yet but like you know ages Eighteen to twenty four\nTwenty five percent margin that they were more likely to vote in their male counterparts that's a huge difference so I think it shows that Latinos are leading the way in our community and what can we tap into with their leadership to impact the rest of the like and what can\nSo Christina let's just imagine a hypothetical here a politician approaches you knowing who you are and what should the sort of work the joke is done and they say okay we want to embrace Latino voters what would you tell them their strategy should be\nOn what we think there's three simple things that people can be going to be clear\nFor the most part this is not happening right now in Texas but one we need to register Latino voters that needs to be part of any candidate a message to you need to understand the issues that matter to Latino voters and the third thing they have to do they have to spend the time and money\nKnocking on the doorstep going to churches into the community to reach them and get them out to vote but again you're gonna find there's been numerous studies conducted nationally that most Latino voters are under invested in and take it for granted by both major political parties right now\nThat's the voice of Christina seeing soon Ramirez she leads jolt in Austin based organization focused on energizing young Latino voters and her latest report is called we are Texas and analysis of young Latino voters in the Lone Star state Cristina thanks again for speaking with us\nThanks so much for having me and you were listening to the Texas standards\n[noise]\nThese back social media editor wells Dunbar that use water Texans talking about on this Thursday well folks are talking about the discussion we just heard a look at Latino voters and their reasons\nFor sitting out elections in many cases here are some of the things we're seeing on her Facebook page\nThere Martha Hubbard says if they realize the tremendous power they hold\nIt would change many things meanwhile Brad ... says that's only assuming all currently non voting Texas Latinos would vote Democrat goes on to say that's not a safe assumption\nA and I'm you know we do have some very interesting races coming on or coming up here and the other group and it's a real race with ... Valdez or so it really will be fascinating to see the role of a Latino Latino voters are in the mid term elections coming right up\nYour absolutely there's been a lot of commentary on line too I mean just look in the past couple of days and it's something you touched on a ... this idea the assumption that a Latino Latinas boat in a certain way I'm may maybe some surprises at least that's where some of the commentary\nYeah he's pointing to definitely one to watch and shifting gears I suppose we need to talk about this one the Boston Red Sox increase their lead over the Houston Astros last night with that ate the six when leaving by one went away for him taking the American league championship series though as things started to look a little ... Houston\nPlenty of fans are asking what might have been had what looked like a two run Astros Homer been ruled as such and not called out over fan interference instead I think you know what I'm Talking about air yes in the first inning it looked like ... to they said one into the stands\nSox catcher ... best left up to catch it as it several fans on the front rows at the minute maid park and I got\nTo say judging from the replay it looked like that glove closed after the ball grazed the side of it so it looked like he would not have caught up in the glove also grazed against fans trying to collect the ball leading umpire Joe West\nThe most hated man in Houston to rule the home run an out\nYeah lots of folks talking about this one and and yeah you can see the replay I saw this one clip on YouTube it was like five it was like you know it was like this is the brutal film it was like five to frame by an angel [laughter] yeah it was insane on her Facebook page Charles Xavier ... says the fan did not reach over the rail it should've been fair game\n... reached into the stands over the railing his real crime was not catching yet\nMeanwhile our town Johnny ... says that if that didn't interfere it would have been caught them obviously the jury is still out there mhm yeah yeah uh\nWhat can I you know the project for the for the Astros trying to defend their title and all that single ... never know you never know what's going to move the needle I get the speaking of which I should probably mention this Columbia Journalism review you they know that the New York times the needle remembers the needle on election\nNight right it was going to go to a no no no shaking violently and it's going to go to Donald Trump right I remember coming back baby for the life of the people in the people in my Twitter feed at least are having a lot of feelings about that and bring a lot of memory\nWhat do you think Texas about this or anything else is on your news radar Texas standard join the conversation on Facebook will Dunbar is looking for you know what are you looking for your back on the radio to marshal van brown wishing you a train wreck there's [laughter]\n\nFamily Foundation men down any right\nAdrian joined [laughter]\nFrom the K U T public media studios you are listening to K. U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one Austin\n[noise]\nMy name's Jesse voter and helping to build out to the red habitat and this is what my job sounds like [noise]\nYeah but house has been on the ground three weeks [noise] [noise]\nGood vibe that people have I have a good time\nListening to K. U. T. Austin [noise]\n\nUh\n\nLine of fire said oh it's been a part of the landscape and the American west but the size and intensity fires over the last several years is something new\nPeople's lives are being ... [noise] it's ... ... ... how how they're trying to find housing that is really no place for these people to\nSolutions includes starting some fired the first people who are here they actually would set fire knowing that would actually improve forest hill\nBy removing the under brush in leaving the taller trees\nThat was caught one Tucker she's currently living in the town of Sonoma while her family rebuild their home in Santa Rosa north of San Francisco does he jumped so much here about another victim ed blood so Seventy six year old man tell us your story\nSo at Bledsoe lives up near Redding with his wife and there are two great grandchildren and\nDuring the Carr Fire it swept in really suddenly had just gone down the street to pick up a check from his doctor and you know while he was gone for the Fifteen minutes his wife and his two little kids they were four and five years old\nThey both are in their home and it shocked a lot of people just because it came out of nowhere and they were two little kids and they were some of the first victims of that fire tornadoes\nAnd Scott Stevens one reason that had led so didn't take those little kids with them that day was a hundred and Thirteen degrees so tell us how the high temperatures and the low\nHumidity is kind of amplifying these fires we've seen recently in the west\nYeah we have temperature like that and humidity what does it just sucks out moisture out of fuel so that fuels certainly going to get drier and we know that's happening already just because of climate change of warming and even the green fuels can had an impact from drought so if you actually make fuel dry or you're just going to be able to burn it easier to have higher intensity more filings\nSo climate is making a drier hotter you know amplifying these fires set the stage for Scott Stephens in terms of the records that we're seeing other really more fires or is it just started perception is that just because they're hitting urban areas\nThere's no doubt fire season is getting longer because of climate change more variation precipitation we can have fires on the ground longer that's absolutely true and we're seeing fires impact people sort of fires impact people and communities and kill people we just heard that I think elevates the whole discussion that happens around fire and I think that's what's happening for the conversation\nAnd so why or fire is coming to people now more than in the past ... what is it about the last couple of years and suddenly I've been covering climate for ten years and kind of knew about fire but it's really become kind of a headline issues the last couple of years\nWe're building in areas that are just more vulnerable a great example Napa Valley had a fire in eighty one that actually burn maybe fifty sixty houses the same perimeter two thousand Seventeen burn six hundred you know so you're seeing so many more people living in places that are beautiful but they're fire places so we're seeing them really have owner abilities and fires it now\nAnd we'll come back to that wild land urban interface in a minute rich Gordon some people think that the timber industry is using these fires exploiting this opportunity to relax restrictions to get more logging is that happening\nNo it isn't that our lands are fairly well managed that has to be done because of the uh the way timber harvests has done in California uh but uh we're concerned about is an industry or use our neighbors today\nWhen fire starts next door if Ken encroach on to to our lands so we've actually taken a position that really wants to look at forest health in a very Broadway concerned about all of the force in California not just the ones that the the timber companies manage\nIt was ... Johnson you've been on the front lines talking to people what are their experiences people saying like wow this is different we see fires but this is different what are they telling you\nThey're horrified to fires are coming into more developed areas like scenarios that these are people that never thought that their home and burned down and now they're getting evacuated in the middle of the night with no warning they're terrified they're traumatized they think it's going to happen again\nThose people want to rebuild and in fact I got one who we spoke to is rebuilding in exactly the same place does he jumps and are there any laws saying well maybe we shouldn't rebuild their because these fires tend to come back every few decades\nRight yeah so that's where we're at right now are trying to figure out what comes next there is no precedent saying that you can take a landowners right to rebuild away so they can rebuild if they went to and oftentimes because they have the\nAnd it's a national attachments to their homes they want to read that just as it was making that lightning on China and its place twice but asked that experience I often experienced again\nAnd Scott Stevens people in northern California and the west loved to have trees next to their homes and you know living near in nature and it's very idyllic\nPastoral and and yet it's it's dangerous I think you're right but if you live in these areas you can still have trees near your home and and beautiful vegetation but you can also managed to lower its density\nLess trees per acre left you on the ground you know make your house a little bit more resistant to fire so there's things you can do to really make a difference so there is great hope that we could actually make things better here in this state too\nSo what are some specific examples of that I mean put mashed on your rain gutters a nice little fence that goes to your house is a pathway for fire so I mean pretty much you'd clear clear cut around your house right is that what it needs to happen\nYou're right you know you can do things like not having a ... roof not having wood siding for your house\nNone of that you can do is get to know your community see now that's one thing that's a challenge because sometimes you know fires on top of the media got Seventy eight year old person next door this not mobile and then you have a plan that fire comes you're going to make sure you get them out and made you got a neighbor over there with a small child\nSo you make a claim with your community that you can execute the plan when the fire happens versus trying to run around and do it at the time\nWhen I talk about the people who are fighting these fires you know people were actually some of the heroes on on the front lines Josh pregnant as a wild land fighter for the city of Santa Fe fire department he's been working for the last two years it has already been all over the western United States\nWe asked him to tell us about some of his experiences and what he thinks the future holds for him and his profession\nThis season we've been two towers were on our way to Oregon at the moment and um we're hoping to use some firefighting California's\nWell this year last year we had some pretty dramatic days or whatever deployments we were to fire ... fire in northeastern New Mexico\nUm it was threatening a watershed area for I think it was brown from Colorado and the other side of the border\nAnd we kept the fire pretty much out of the watershed so we preserve the water supplies for the\nThere's definitely a sense and we're going to be busy in to the foreseeable future I don't think anyone expects there will be in trouble for downturn\nThis will get worse as climate change progress as as temperatures continue to rise in weather patterns become radical wild land firefighters will become\nYou know sort of his people kind of a patient in in the public consciousness 'cause it's just going to be some footage of these tremendous fires [noise] even if you live in an urban area you're still dealing with the ... the possible contamination of water supplies\nFor the forests are healthy effects you even if you don't live in or near worst [noise]\nWas Josh fragment of wild land firefighter for the city of Santa Fe New Mexico does he Johnson you interviewed some of these uh these firefighters tell us about you know first of all their fatigue that must be going through because it's just nonstop\nNoel is definitely lower this year because they're happens and then he fired at ECOtality is I like that then you had to fire back in\nThe morning after I went to their firefighter sat on the Mendocino Complex and it was the first they tally for that fire and there is just this sense as shocking disbelief they\nWere out here trying to say how states and stop this firing people are dying and now you have to go again it seems very ... and all the sudden how many risks come along with that job\nRisks and and really high cost you have a sense of how much is being spent on fire fighting in California I mean it's bigger bigger part of the state budget Scott\nStevens blasted ... I'm probably a little out of date about four hundred and thirty million dollars has been spent by the state this year I firefighting doesn't include probably the federal firefighting as well and I think we've almost actually used up the entire allocation or fire fighting as that probably right now ... everything else is going to be in excess of what an budgeted\nSo close to half a billion and how does that compare to say ten years ago\nYou know as back around the mid nineties the mid nineties when we look at the budget firefighting through the whole nation it was around two hundred million a hundred fifty million dollars that was in the whole nation\nAnd today very typical for us to spend two point five billion so it's gone from something on the order of two hundred million two hundred and fifty million in that range to two point five billion from the mid nineties\nI Know you're listening to a climate one conversation about wildfires and climate change burning wood releases the C. O. two victories have been ... been firing twenty Thirteen which burned a quarter of a million acres released\nThe equivalent of more than two billion gallons of gas according to the EPA coming up Greg ask\nScott Stevens just how serious is it\nLike a ... a lot of people look at the forest to at least maintain carbon stocks but of course we're seeing now fires actually burning ... I Know there's really concerned about this because we're wondering maybe this is beginning to really short circuit um are longer term plans to reduce emissions left to react when climate one continues\nThis week on all things considered and hear the latest news Saudi Arabia and I get along with all of what it means\nCongress and the American media are not going to let the show you just go away\nAnd some things that aren't so serious Hi is this seemingly credit didn't pay his Audie Cornish listen to all things considered to hear the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News\nYou can hear all things considered lived tomorrow right here on K U G starting at four pm\nAnd all of the multinational publicly traded companies left California\nWe don't have Louisiana Pacific we don't have warehouse or none of those companies are here companies that do timber work in California are all family owned are owned by family trust\nSo these are people who said because it was their land\nAnd this was their home and so it's a very different kind of world and California that folks really take a closer look at what they do and most most of the companies now have policies of the being very selective in their harvest to generate the lumber that's needed but not too too over excessively or reduce forest land\nOil companies are getting into biofuels and energy companies are getting into solar or wind diversify the kind of see what's coming to timber companies have the same kind of a diversification are they still more traditional\nWell under what they know it does a number of the timber companies are involved in in bio energy\nTaking would waste in wood products and we're not using for any other purpose and turning them into energy most of that though is being done in local communities or running a saw mill somewhere in California that energy is still very expensive\nAnd so it's not necessarily purchased on the grid that's very rare there are I think seven bio energy facilities that have contracts\nFor the energy companies to buy that fuel that energy\nForests are now carbon sink so there's actually value for sequestering carbon and forests inland people can get paid basically as an opportunity there for your\nMembers rich Gordon there are certain conservation eats mints that many of my members seek that to provide additional protections for lands that they're not going to harvest their don't want to harvest and there are some trade offs that they can do in terms of the carbon credits for protecting those\nScott Stevens California's lead the country and attacking climate change and it really started with tailpipe smokestacks and then it got to\nYou know the exhaust from cows and farms and forests we're kind of further out there even yet tell us how for us or not really part of the state's climate plans are kind of on the periphery some people like them to be more front and center\nMake up a lot of people look at the forest to at least maintain carbon stocks\nBut of course we're seeing now fires actually burning for struggling grasslands and all these other activities that we're seeing more and more smoke going up and I know for sure and the state capital Sacramento that there's really concerned about this because we're wondering maybe this is beginning to really short circuit um or longer term plans to reduce emissions\nForce are supposed to write put carbon back on the ground we basically been burning it sending it up into the air that we don't know how that math working\nOut we looked at some parts of the state as you know northwestern California have read would have Douglas fir forest or wet so those places are still sequestering carbon you know big time because of just their growth and you can put some of those products you know into things like housing so you can sequester would into long term use so it's gonna be a combination I think both having\nForce that's a question of carbon try to hold it better in the face of climate change and fire and also continue to do things with wood because what is a very environmentally friendly material to build homes and other things\nWhich Gordon of the California legislature passed a bill that there's some things on electric utilities as well as used restrictions on a on some setting and logging about a billion dollars using cap and trade funds tell us about that what that law will do\nIt was a comprehensive piece of legislation it dealt with the utility liability issues dealt with firefighter protection it dealt with emergency response and emergency preparedness and it also dealt with force practices and part of what they did with force practices was make it easier for small landowners\nTo remove the excess fuel from their lands so now neighbors can collaborate together if you have to have a project less than ten thousand acres working together you can clear trees around your homes or makes it easier to do that\nWell some environmentalists have written and said well there's already exemptions for fire that already existed why do we need this this was a\nYou know some of the ... you know candy bar for logging something like that\nAre are forced practice rule stay in place the exemptions dumped exempt folks from following or environmental standards they exempt them from some of the paperwork that's involved is essentially becomes a checklist of rather than a full blown a report\nBut what this does a particularly for the small landowners is allow people to work collectively together and then you get to an economy of scale that will allow the kind of thinning around homes or in the neighborhoods and we've been talking about tonight that face this kind of wild land urban interface clearing in those areas\nWas he Johnson smoke has come into areas and some people in urban California walking round with with the masks on what do we know about the human health impacts of breathing smoke for weeks at a time\nThey were trying to figure that out but it's something crazy the equivalent of like smoking a pack of cigarettes if you pay them that smoke very day and they still figuring out at the long term impacts are too that got into that and the county right now they're having a steady as pregnant women who gave birth to fire to see what the impacts way\nIt's not anything ... I can tell you that night's birth weight that sort of thing that sort of thing right\nScott Stevens what kind of research is there on the health impacts of breathing Smokey air I mean Sacramento British Columbia is all up and down the west coast in North America more smoke them we breathed in our lifetime\nNo it's true and we think about smoking impacts the shared berries misspoke out Sacramento for months northern parts of California for months at a time so it really impacts probably the highest amount of people really the indirect impact smoke because they're spread all over the state British Columbia had five hundred and fifty lighting fires and three days this year in August\nAnd that smoke actually made it to the bay area it made it because it went out into the Pacific and the jet stream took it to us so there's no doubt smoke impacts are huge and if we're going to go to using fire maybe to actually manage force we're gonna have more smoke in the air\nSo you're talking about prescribed fire or planned five you're talking about burning for a for us in a in a controlled way before they get out of control and and that's like okay we're going to burn at a certain time and just okay people here comes\nNo that's right and it's something that um I think we're going trying to really do more of an estate and I think right now with the governor's bill that just got past thirty five million dollars a year for the next five years has actually been put out prescribe fire application\nWhat about the tourism impacts Scott Stephens I talked to someone who lives in Montana whitefish Montana her husband worked for the tourism industry people go there for a Glacier National park they need to make their money and like four months of the year and it gets Smokey and the tourists don't want to go the glacier to paddle or cycle or hike\nBut what about the tourist impacts of this I think it's very large sum of the rural counties in this state in northern California where tourism is really big you know fishing hiking camping big fire years can basically take the tourism economy down fifty percent so that is really difficult and how do you think about\nA place like California going into a warming climate with more variable precipitation ignition by lightning and people\nFire just hasn't come out of the equation right so somehow we've got to be able to think about how we can maybe work with fire and do the best we can but the idea that we can continue just exclude fire excluded exclude it like we have for the last hundred years we can see now that it's not working and it's time for some innovation is a new ideas and some some places a change\nIn this climate one you're listening to a conversation about mega fires coming up grain belt in ask God and how we should release think forest management in this new reality\nDoing things like you know ... force cut the small trees tried enhanced the large ones doing prescribe fired we have we're the good things that we can do today in science shows that it works that kept next when climate wine continue their support\nComes from ...
