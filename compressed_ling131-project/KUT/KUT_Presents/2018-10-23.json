U. T. Austin just ... tweeted that the Travis County clerk\nDena Davis was is that six thousand six hundred eighty people have voted in person in the county as of ten am quote it looks like we are headed toward the presidential turnout numbers that I thought we might get end quote\nThere so yeah so bracing themselves for a very busy day at the polls where that is also getting borne out by the messages folks are sending us a David via Facebook\nJohnson Simmons sent us a photo of a line to vote at St Edward's University in Austin students and faculty have one day only to use the polling location at these mobile a polling locations Austin a well when the city that has these\nAnd he adds that when people care about the issues affecting them this is what happens that big big turnout\nOf course not everyone today are not everyone can make it today Doris Murdoch's weeds is that she is voting tomorrow plus getting my husband's mail in ballot mail plus nagging my daughter and her stuff and my son and his style than anyone else I Know\nTo vote so lots of enthusiasm lots of them out there and you know speaking of enthusiasm we're also going to be keeping an eye on the situation and she was not just the voting situation but that's a rally tonight right has been trumpeting supportive Ted Cruz and other Texas Republicans I'm definitely definitely something to watch there too yeah Donald Trump\nTweeting out a big night in Texas this morning so I guess he's going to be on route there I had heard that he's going to be at an arena that seats about Eighteen thousand people but art Acevedo the police there in Houston is bracing for crowds he was saying over the weekend or something like Seventy thousand the grief\nOut of it was very very small I think it was a ... initially scheduled at a place that only help something like a thousand people of\nA definitely a step I knew they moved it you know well speaking of early voting another comment here from Timothy ally on he says I think everyone in Austin is a little busy figuring figuring out the boil water notice and bottle and buying bottled water before they go vote people are in line at the grocery store instead of the polling place [laughter] you know some places\nI think it's rentals you can vote and maybe ... water out of it that lots of folks talking about this one it's obviously affecting lots of people I I think some of my co workers here in the newsroom were tweeting out photos of the bottles of water I have wind up my dad\nCurrently no one's taking me up Hunger Games without competition for said bottles of water lots of people talking about that I keen on Twitter says a boil water notice or conspiracy to vice hobo Chico well let's\nSee go jokes are seriously person not a tweet that said if you have the privilege or access to clean bottled water please give the people who may not have that same access you know you and I get to go home boil water or obviously could be an issue for some other [noise] yep a big boil water freaked out\nHere at all in every one you want to have my eyes water a lasso we're not talking to the broadcast we'd love to know what's going on in your neck in Texas sweet ... Texas standard we're going to be back here for the big broadcast tomorrow we hope you'll join us about the entire team I'm David pushing a marvelous Monday\nFailing traffic fans got out\nThe way in the family may not finished grad school and joined [laughter]\n\n\nThis is K.

voluntary and generous listener contributions make all the news you count on possible we accomplish a lot [noise] we do it together [noise]\nJoined the public radio partnership and bring often another great year of the reporting you trust [noise] it's easy to do and only picked a couple of minutes\nGive on line safely and securely at ... dot org\nFor color but five on two four seven one six to nine one\nFacts\n\nOn public radio international I Madeleine Brand and this is America abroad uh\nOne reason why Islamist idiotic to spread so quickly because at least share through the media extremist messages are being broadcast on hope it's in schools and over the airwaves but in the middle east there's been a rise of broadcasters who are producing TV shows that offer\nDifferent methods show ISIS is love is the ... in any way and liberal cleric there also finding ways to connect\nSo when it comes to effort to combat I says you can see a lot of cooperation among groups that normally don't get along\nAnd Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in this regard so how important\nIs this anti extremist media and are there messages having an impact and explore the voices moderating the Arab airways ... on America by first his name's\nSaudi Arabia isn't the only Middle Eastern country too heavily restricted media according to Joseph ... he's the middle east specialist and author of the book broadcasting change Arabic media as a catalyst for liberalism and he says some media in the middle east is just state sponsored\nWithin the borders of monarchy or public most of them certainly all of the major media is these are controlled or dominated indirectly by the ruler\nAnd the ultimate goal of it is the same it's to tell a story one big story in which the ruler is indispensable so if it's a monarchy the story is about a king who protects and ancient tradition and provides for his people\nIf it's a republic then the story stars a president a revolutionary who breaks with tradition and bring social justice to the\nProblem is that both of these stories are severely challenged by evidence of the country\nAnd that's an opening for the media workers especially the liberals among them to suggest tweaks to the basic story line like let's put more women in it\nOr let's show the role of the people in engaging the rulers aspirations for social justice and that is how you get improvements in authoritarian media overtime\nWhat personal costs do these workers propose these changes as it risky to try to change the narrative or adjust the narrative\nIt is it is risky um but it is a game that um conviction driven employees of authoritarian media\nSpend their lives playing a slow moving you have to navigate you know your own desire to maintain a career in livelihood on the one hand with your desire to press for change on the other sometimes there are casualties in that struggle you at the very least you can lose your job and sometimes worse\nBut ah it is a struggle that there are a critical mass of people who are willing to wage but generally the basic value proposition is\nThat they are not being anti establishment in the sense of subversion against the ruler instead they're partnering with the ruler\nTo challenge extremist strains in the society\nThat are both a threat to the ruler and a threat to the overall progress of the country\nAnd so where it works is where they're able to forge a partnership with the authorities in pursuing certain discreet goals they can't do everything they want a but they look for the common ground\nCan you give me an example the the most striking example in the Arab world is Saudi Arabia because they're the monarchy to liberals is seen as their support base against the conservative and hard line strains in Saudi society\nIn other words they're both struggling against a clerical domination of the culture and the public space and so that would be an example where where certain media feel that they are\nAllied with the establishment and you see that to greater in lesser degrees in other Arab countries\nBut they can't actually question the Saudi leadership that's correct they cannot push against the these these are not agents of democratic change\nThese are people who were pushing for a social reforms in an authoritarian framework and the minute they start talking about\nRepresentative government there on shaky ground but many of them say look we don't want to democracy right now because if we got one those hardline social forces that are opposed to us would likely when the elections and so instead we are going to spend a generation\nTransforming the majority culture\nAnd only then will we start pushing for democratic change tell us about the show selfie selfies a show that airs in the Gulf on a channel that enjoys a freedom to broadcast from the United Arab Emirates and it is a Saturday on channel\nAnd what the show does every season every Ramadan is to spoof a social trend that has caused problems\nOn us cats comedy show a call ... cells have won both praise and death threats after mocking the Islamic state group\nSo one year or they were looking at ISIS and they told the story of the kind of a hapless middle aged father who journeys into ISIS land under the guise of all would be fighter to rescue his son from their brain washing of him and bring them home\nThen in the course of that he has to pretend to be a jihad as they want him to execute an infidel and he goes from one to the next and says well this one is to ball or a I don't like the look of this guy his ears are too big to a\nLot of them you know what\nHe does everything he can to to act to not actually fight a but be able to spend time with his son and it has a tragic ending but you're laughing along the way the fiery to beat around the episode was caused by the concluding much for being with two coffees character executed by far the subjects of that\nIs to show and impressionable audience that might be vulnerable to overtures from ISIS that it's not what it's cracked up to be and it's actually a very ugly place\nEmotional scene struck a chord with the audience to\nRecognize the disintegration of the Arab family unit the terrorism that may be\nSelf evident too many westerners but in the middle east where extremist messages are being broadcast on pope that's in schools and over the airwaves\nThat's not a foregone conclusion and so it takes proactive programming satire biting social criticism and so on to instill a different message in certain sectors of the public\nWho is writing these shows\nThere is a if we're talking about Saudi Arabia and the Gulf there is actually a a long standing scene of intellectual ferment among liberals\nWho against Assad's strove to be actors stroke to be social critics and they were always there they were in in unusual places like there was a College of a faculty of agriculture\nIn Saudi Arabia that have the theater was one of the only places where you could study theater and put on plays a but over time as a range of sectors caused liberalism to become more expedient for the rulers to promote\nA they gained more and more space to do their work and were ultimately catapulted to the very highest levels of celebrity and notoriety\nBut then we have the case of ... he was the Egyptian Jon Stewart that's how he was described jumpstart even appeared on his show\nUp I mean uh I mean I Know I Wish all the best for you or I mean you know you have absolutely\nNo job you know that's actually interesting you bring that up because uh I heard the right to be an opening for the type of humor that I Do in this very studio\n[noise] however then\nFive years ago he was forced off the air and you had to flee because he was afraid of being arrested so what does that say about the ability for these intellectuals to go against the state and even in a comedic setting but to try to satirize modern society [noise] you're\nRight he was he was forced off the air he fled to Egypt for a while he tried to do is show on NBC Saturday on channel with a seemingly liberal bent a and that didn't work out either and now he's here in the U.S on an academic fellowship\nAnd I think what his story shows is when you leave that value proposition of and partnering with the authorities to challenge extremism in the society and you start talking about challenging the authorities themselves\nIt's unsustainable within the borders of an autocratic country\nBut I guess how how much um authenticity will you have if you can't criticize the ruling elite with the viewers I mean what they see that you're just basically an arm of the corrupt leadership\nThat is definitely one of the trade offs um and so your popularity is inextricably linked to the popularity of the ruler [noise]\nUh we do have some examples of autocrats who are popular right now with young people\nBut certainly there are those who are extremely unpopular so that that is the essential tradeoff if you want to work within the territory of the autocracy is on the other hand you go to the root of the Iraqi John Stewart and you start broadcasting from Germany\nYou risk another type of challenge to you or authenticity which has have working for the German government [noise]\nSo it's six of one half a dozen of the other and people adjust according to their own comfort levels and preferences\n[noise] so how can you measure whether or not all of this is working to create change positive change [noise] doing\nSo is especially difficult in environments where focus groups and opinion surveys are less effective uh because of concerns about expressing your own opinion\nDon't have to do this and in fact you do exactly that you know I just think that there's just not the right way to go into one of the terrorists that not to join a gym how they will\nBe in black crows children's lives up portrayed as grin and violent tape for you on ...\nIn one scene a group\nOf boys asked how they will get to heaven by car by boat by plane the children gas their leader who is depicted as a pita file says no color\nOver them and they're going by something faster he says that ... mile\nAn explosive belt it's pretty scary stuff but is it successful in countering violent extremism questions\nLike I said I I think we should ask our assessing the first place what do we mean by successful you know I mean do\nWe need to respond to read I mean there is a big problem you're not a media which is a lack of a reliable and better than me guess status on the organisms are just so I mean everything is pretty much with the author\nHigh degree that it's difficult to know exactly what impact black crows had but he says\nImagine the series having to work on just one person ... brought about a ... or ... or or having going with it\nFive or ... ... ... ... ... these are criminals these are not do that would have achieved the objectors\nA few months ago Netflix also picked up the black close series and now it's available with subtitles for for an audience to even though ISIS seems to be nearing its defeat it's unlikely to be the last jihadi groups recruiting in the region and abroad\nI said that the duty of broadcasters like NBC that radicalization\nMaybe there should be a coalition of ... at the moon the golden rule moves around the world who work together on developing a hundred of theaters like good ... going to some of the willing to fight the goals of going through those and say enough is enough [noise]\n\nFor more now on how anti extremist programming has been effective in parts of the middle east Rebecca colored is with us now Hi there\nHi metal and [noise] so tell us more about this black crows show will they produce more episode\nWell that's a really interesting question actually because originally I'm this ran as a Ramadan Sherry so what are the most popular times a year for TV is during the ah Islamic holy month of Ramadan and after breaking the fast it's traditionally that families will sit down and watch TV together so\nOriginally this ran I'm actually at last Ramadan a and it was supposed to be a ... just for that period of time now the first thing that's interesting about that is that in the end it was only twenty episodes and and after the controversy that I talked about in the piece\nUm there was also a rumor that it was actually cut short that um it should have been more episodes usually these programs run up the whole length of the month\nA rather than just twenty episodes but also interesting is that just this year a just a few months ago actually uh this the same series black crows was released on Netflix with English subtitles so\nI think that with an effort a you know when I spoke to NBC they said that what they want it to do was to make this available to a wider audience more languages to more areas\nUh but as far as ... reproducing this show or more episodes of this show that's that's not on the agenda\nWill another method of messaging is through mosques how effective is that compared to TV programming\nWell you know across the board when I talked to experts when I talked to a ... uh and when I asked people even at NBC that produce black crows I asked them how effective is that how effective is programming\nAnd it's very difficult to tell you know it's it's never like we have a list\nOf people that would have gone to join ISIS if they hadn't seen it or or who went despite having seen this sort of programming whether it'd be something entertainment focused like black crows or something like ... which of course is more about uh Islamic pushing so in all cases it's really difficult\nTo tell 'em you know what is more effective\nBut um I Know as you as you heard in the piece um what a representative from NBC says it's affected as long as it stopped one person so\nAs far as a bigger sense of of how how effective this whether it's really difficult to tell\nAnd what are some other countries in the region that also have state run anti extremist television shows\nI looked around the region thinking that this would be a model that was caught me by a lot of different countries but there was really nothing that was um kind of as big or as popular as ...\nUh you know in Egypt or the government does control several Islamic TV shows but they're not very popular um in Turkey that was really nothing comparable as well so definitely most of these countries have some sort of channel um that that is some sort of Islamic content but ah but nothing that compares to the one in Morocco\nThat for back a collared speaking to us from Beirut [noise]\nComing how some religious clerics in the middle east are harnessing new media to fight conservative ideology\nToday for the vast majority of Muslims ISIS is an extremist group in the sense that it's norms and practices are beyond the pale of what most Muslims would agree their religion teaches\nAnd Islamic television preachers see themselves as having a very important role in disregard because they see their main role as teaching Muslims what Islam really means or what it really entails [noise]\nJust tuning in you can catch the whole episode and pass program by subscribing to America abroad on items or wherever you get your\nSupport comes from
