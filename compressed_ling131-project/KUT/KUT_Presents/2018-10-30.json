in that effort anywhere from five hundred thousand seven eight hundred thousand people of Mexican origin including ... as the children were deported why\nWhat was the ... why the early Nineteen thirties was I mean I think a lot of people didn't uh didn't at the time didn't have any idea of just what sort of immigration enforcement policy the United states had if there was a formal policy\n[noise] there was a to some extent that was a racial animus involved but also the argument that government officials made is that resources are limited during the economic crisis and they should already be shared with U.S born people\nSo we're talking about the great depression or essentially they started the greatest rushing the welfare programs that are that were lost in the early thirties [noise] uh what about the Mexican government what was their reaction when hundreds of thousands of Mexicans I'm a or people of Mexican\nDescent or or heritage began as streaming back across the border well\nThere were under a lot of criticism from the left and the right for not speaking forcefully about the problems with Mexico's of this country\nSo um they decided to set up a colonization program which provided land and tools and see the fertilizer to people in the northern region of Mexico the call that the colonization program so they encouraged people come back home\nYou know there's sort of reminds me of this sort of push pull that there have been a a sort of waves in American history certainly through the twentieth century in which the United states government wants to bring in a more laborers uh inexpensive labor and they often turn to Mexico you think of the service program for example which was started in the\nEnd the war time ever in the Nineteen forties uh and then you see a later in the Nineteen fifties another wave of mass deportations\nWas that that shows a pattern of us uh immigration policy they the ... the government um encourages people to come or when they're needed and they discourage them from coming or deport them\n... during political okay comic crisis or a political crisis like the one we're facing today\nI think a lot of listeners have not heard of the Nineteen thirty mass deportations a ... or Nineteen thirties mass deportations and I'm and I'm Wondering if you think about\nThat what happened then and you think about the the the patterns as you know them to be as an historian and you overlay that over what's happening today what do you see [noise]\nWell there's a saying that history rhymes with the president\nUm the decision by the federal government to to draw people in there needed to expel them\nOr would they are not needed is part and also the political culture that is newspapers a journalist as well as a politicians of all sorts and local governments are administrators contributed to this or\nThis or a an environment\nIn which Mexicans are seen as a expendable objects and the labor market so it's not just the federal government that the U.S and Mexico that are complicit in this I think a\nLot of us are now as well as in the Nineteen thirties or complicit by\nA with our style than for example\nI mean ... is a professor in the history department at the University of Texas at Austin he's the author of several books in his focus has been on the history of Mexicans in
