African a retail conglomerate that also sells mattresses and in Africa um but it turned out you know last year that um they were also embroiled in this financial accounting scandals are of\nEnron proportions and um that's sort of when the financial troubles of um ... sort of came to light\nYeah I Want to get back to that a point about how many retail stores there are because it's long been almost to me really are on on line\nThat you that uh you know what ... what why would any retailer of a product that people typically by every seven to ten years\nHave a store every few blocks and if you drive around for instance the Texas capital city here and there I mean you literally can't go more than a than a mile or so before you see yet another I mean just Google it and you'll see that but it's amazing what what's the what was the thinking\nWell I I think that that question puzzle lot of outsiders for a long time or you know people were\nNot ... theory is that they were betting on line and and people had all these kind of idea that that the reason why I I think you know it it comes down to you know these mattresses cell or a very high premium and I think matches from salt that you know they could have a mattress store um\nYou know put maybe one or two sales staff in there\nAnd ah you know if they can sell want her to mattresses or a month\nThey said you know really um you know break even and turn a profit eventually if they saw more I think what happened was that they had acquired a lot of these competitors are over the years and um that put a lot of strain on their business model\nSo what's mattress for him saying about its next steps they plan to continue in business right\nYes so this is a chapter eleven bankruptcy it's um they're they're looking to tear down the number of stores bankruptcy proceeding will allow them to um get rid of a lot of the least is that they've signed over the years so you know they have a secure a number of rounds to get them through the bankruptcy proceedings which um they said and I\nExpect to take about forty five to sixty days so I'm after that um we'll see what happens I think analysts think that not just from\nAnd its parent company ... maybe looking to you know for a buyout um buyers could include private equity firms I'm\nI've also hurts her sentence which is ah the nation's largest mattress maker and I'm currently a match firms ... you know major supplier they may be interested as well they may be exploring this option as well but we'll see what happens ah it it's going to be an interesting

off on line a divisive late on our Facebook page with that yes here's one perspective from our Facebook page from Philip Ballard he calls cabin on one of the greatest legal minds of our generation top of his class at Yale Law school\nWell respected by most everyone in DC until Trump nominated him Phillip says that the media and Democrats ... and his family an apology meanwhile hearing from people with different perspective James ... is still hung up on\nWhy Kavanaugh why this guy why not another conservative judge who isn't damaged goods I still suspect there's eight nefarious reason why they

founder and chief help officer a collective health later stumbled on to Russia but they do [noise]\nNobody knew healthcare could be so complicated [laughter] so explain president from last year he continued let it be a failure\nWashington cannot save our health care system\nWashington responds more to the interests of pharmaceutical companies big health insurers and hospitals system than it does all of us who are accessing care\nHospital payments since two thousand up sixty percent pharmaceutical cough up sixty nine percent\nOf the Democratic administration that took affordability out of the Affordable care\nSo I think you've made our argument Moran paranoid\nSo you'll use the debaters words would return for\nPrimary care is seven percent of health care than they are definitely going to change the way that primary care is delivered I Hope both as a consumer in a position that Amazon comes in and pull the rug out from drug companies\nTen to Fifteen Percent of spending remember\nHow much of the drugs and stuff that actually happened in ... a lot of it is in other places Amazon's not going to touch that\nWhen you look at other retailers look at CBS what are they in addition to being a retailer well let's look at their balance sheet\nA hundred and Seventy seven billion dollars of annual revenue a hundred and twenty billion of that comes from being a pharmacy benefit manager of one of those secrets in middle men who makes tons of money off of you and me and the employers by negotiating and coming up with secret drug prices\nI Would argue are they a retailer or are they in middle man when you look at the company\n... and some of what I think your opponent is saying is that benefit so you're talking about that the rebels may provide are real to the extent that they go but you're saying that they touch such a small part of the problem the resolution will save us health care system it's a big big target and also Rosemary to him at the same point the retailers camps scale to the real size of the\nProblem I don't agree with that I mean if you look at the top two pharmacy chains that have twenty thousand retail locations amongst them so\nAnd we have five thousand five hundred hospitals in this country if you look at you know the large retailers like Wal Marts and others that you're adding another ten or Fifteen thousand locations here too so\nThat a lot of them are in rural locations too that are underserved that can't get to a doctor forty percent of them don't have a primary care physician so this was the only place that they're going to get their care that a lot of them have these diabetes they have heart disease they have the big contributors to the ... percent that make a fifty percent of our health care dollars\nSo if they can engage with them and they can help manage behaviors and they can do more preventative type activities whether or not it makes more profit to them because they buy more things I mean there's it's it's reducing our cost of care that big of a ticket to Rosemary the\nThere's actually evidence that the retailers and nice clinics and such do not try to locate in areas that are underserved we were looking at is that in Chicago that showed there were actual blackout areas where the retailers wouldn't go because they don't see it as a money making place to have a clinic pharmacy desert\nWhich are your team is arguing that the retailers come with specific skills in advantages to that can be scaled but I Want to talk about what those skills in advantages are what are they good at with consumers and also the use of data that you are arguing gives them an advantage\nWhen you go into that retail clinic and they know who you are they know about you but that's actually not the entirety of the story it's actually more to me about how they're incentives are aligned\nAnd how they're competing they're competing to be the most convenient solution to be the lowest cost solution for you in today's world\nWho gets rewarded who's strikes the best back room deal and in the future who get rewarded if you provide the best service at the best price and takes care of the member and delivered outcomes okay\nWhen I took her to have to really find it interesting you mentioned in your opening remarks surgery center Oklahoma I Know those guys are a bunch of orthopedic surgeons who opened ambulatory surgery center so why are you not considering that retail what's your guess there are still operating within the traditional confines of employer sponsored insurance\nThey do seem Medicare patient says well they do contracting\nWith the state of Oklahoma\nThey are very traditional provider that has existed for decades who is very smartly taking some ideas\nFrom the retail world and applying them to make the traditional system\n... you may find a strong point to actually I just want to know how you respond to it\nThey are bringing a retail approach to health care and that's what we need that ... every employer in America is driving toward what they seek to do\nIt for award quality work directly with providers systems that easy for them all to replicate what we've created in the retail space clear simple transactions and rewarding for value I agree\nThat Amazon Berkshire Hathaway J. P. Morgan has some Amazon Jew Jew but why haven't other employer alliance is like the health transformation alliance which had IBM eight CIA over two dozen large companies they haven't done anything from cutting a few drug company contract\nI Want to let the other two voices and into the conversation here no I'm Rosemarie you made the point the retailers bottom line is not society's bottom line they're saying actually those two things are not in conflict with each other necessarily\nThey're saying the incentives are aligned and that they CBS or any other provider up the scale would have absolutely every motive to have happy customers happy consumers getting the health care they need so there's not that conflict there\nThe key is who can actually be a customer it has to be somebody who has\nA way to pay for something they have to have an ability to pay and so whether that's coming out of their pocket or the employer that is covering their insurance\nOr they're on the Medicaid program and that's actually a government subsidy somehow there has to be some money for the transaction and there are a lot of people who don't have\nAccess to any of those things I just mentioned and so they're shut out so we don't have a hundred percent customer base and that's where retail bottom\nLine is ... but they've been making the argument that in fact it's people who of lesser means who are able to take advantage of things like a minute clinic at a Wal Mart or CBS that they're not cut out that they are more opportunity choice than they would otherwise to\nSome limited extent but there are still people who simply can't even access\nIf they can't access that they probably can't access other\nCare facilities as well so I think there is a better chance that they can access cure than a retail environment too because think about retail is well I mean the reason why they're lower cost is because they're subsidizing the bricks and mortar they don't have these towers they don't have these ivory towers full of doctors they'll get baked into the prices\nThose are rock bottom prices\nAnd we talk about the ivory tower what about the ivory ICU I don't see Wal Mart having a four dollar for dollar operating\nBut that the better point for me to make is actually that it's not just about the sniffles than a minute clinics can deal with it the more intensive needs that there are shut out of\nRichard I don't think we're arguing that you're going to go and get a triple coronary bypass in a target dressing room\nNor are we arguing that government should completely abdicate its role\nAnd an Rosemarie with all due respect\nThe argument that employers are only covering half of America and therefore can exert changed on the system just doesn't hold water employers are the largest pair and the health care system and they're the business class passengers are paying the highest price it to the provider systems\nEmployers do have the ability to exert their power and get prices under control federal programs will benefit from that by having lower prices in a more responsible system where we contain run away gross well\nThat's really interesting because why are they paying almost twice as much as Medicare for the exact same things that\nActually suggest that government has more of the power to influence prices then the employers have shown today\nRosemarie day founder and CEO day health strategies arguing that employers don't have the power to control the rising cost of healthcare we'll hear the other side of just a moment and questions from the voting\nOn intelligence squared us\nSometimes the news can feel far off from your day to day on all things considered we cover national story on a local level to listen to all things considered to hear the bigger picture every afternoon\nYou can hear all things considered tomorrow starting at ... pm right here on K.
