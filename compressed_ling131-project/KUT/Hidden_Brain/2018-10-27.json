P. A. murals in in post offices across the country I mean if you've ever seen them if they're murals all over and they celebrate the dignity of blue collar work\nYou have strong you know effective guys doing important dirty we're building the country and they're really held up um a as kind of one of the ideals have ... and um strength and that was very much the\nCultural image of the blue collar guy until you know the sixties or seventies when it began to wane and we had a flip in cultural imagery of blue collar men um and I think\nOf this you can see this actually through situation comedies I mean you think of Homer Simpson I'm Joe as\nAn emblematic of the stereotype of white working class men today he's kind of game waited I'm Amy Abul sat in sexual or do you think of Archie Bunker\nFamous TV character in the Nineteen seventies let me tell you something I actually shook Washington and all its ... who also was\nDemoted in fat or also racist and sexist so you had this sharp\nFall from social honor of blue collar men [noise] um and\nIt's still very deeply as a personal front when\nYou speak with people from the working class or one of the things you're saying the book is that they feel that they are often stereotype to stereotype is being poorly educated they're stereotyped as being ugly course they have that piece the fat I mean these are very very personal\nA sort of charge us if you will that are that are in some ways must be experienced as a form of humiliation\nDidn't they aren't form of humiliation I think the American meat has put a lot of thought into self correcting are stereotypes of the poor and so we it would be considered bad taste in my circles stereotypes of poor um\nI think that we stereotype the working class especially the white working class as sort of stupid racist losers and we use that kind of a mute button\n'em to say I'm not going to listen to anything they say\nBut that's really a misuse of anti racism as an excuse for snobbery you have elite white people refusing to listen to the legitimate economic complaints\nOf less elite white people on the grounds that those other white people are racist you know there's a lot of racism you know where you have white people you're going to have racism that's very sad history of this country but\nUsing anti racism at the mute button is not helping the situation\nYou mentioned a Homer Simpson a second ago we actually found some tape a whiz Homer Simpson I Want you to listen to this exchange\n[laughter] time to go to work they do do they know I'm ducking out early to take the ... ... tour\nRolling it named ... ... the plane\nIf they don't just ... thing\nThey did a ... ...\nOh did I did it or just ... ...\nAre you in the ... [noise]\nSo there's a lot to unpack show and it's not just a the narrative of stupidity but it's also a narrative of people who don't really care about their work about people who are naturally motivated and of course is all packaged in in sort of an overall\nYou know the overall picture is one of a of of humor right I mean this would be so elites making fun of people who are blue collar people\n[noise] that's right and I mean one of the things that blue collar people are that ethic of self discipline and hard work is so central to them and they're you know they're very proud of their ability to go to these often not very fulfilling jobs\nDay after day after day for forty years straight and I think here if my father in law who went um did they did exactly that he worked in a factory that made those machines that measure the humidity and museum and he was an inspector he hated\nHis job he went to it for forty years and he was proud of doing a good job while he was at work or he was proud is the work that he did and he took it seriously and he worked very hard and he deserved dignity for that and\nOne of the things that I've been trying to explain to people is that these jobs are important jobs you know when I get up in the morning and I turn on the top it's not because of some knowledge workers that water comes out it's because of some blue collar person\nAnother thing that strikes me and this is actually from a really fascinating article studying class in sitcoms\nIs Marge in the Simpson is depicted as a smarter and more responsible and more grown up than Homer\nSimpson is and that's a pattern in American sitcoms where I'm In if you look at professional miniature your family's in sitcoms it's father knows best and mothers and good support but if you look at working class families in sitcoms\nThe the woman is smarter and often the children are smarter than the gym with his dad so it's like kind of a class of front and the gender front exacerbating the class of front\nYou and your husband come from different backgrounds or you're the fourth generation of lawyer and your family and you went to Yale\nAnd Harvard and MIT your husband came from blue collar roots or he's what you call it a class migrant are telling me about a high school reunion he wants attended at and the question she asked for former classmate\nAnd what this exchange reveal to you\nYeah so we went back to his high school reunion and you know I'm the anthropologist he's not so he did what he'd come to be used to in upper middle class circles he asked one of his classmates what do you do absolutely the standard question my crowd and uh [noise]\nThat his classmate was really offended that classmate put his face very close to my husband's face he got beat red and he said I sell\nToilet\nAnti obviously felt that the what do you do question was a class insult from a virtually the only member of their high school class from this blue collar a rust belt town\nThat had made it and um and what that really shows you what is the again going back to the classic culture that well why does my crowd why do we ask each other what do you do what we do because it's a form of social display\nWhat do I do I'm a law professor that's a form of social honor [noise] what the I sell toilets comment men is that I'm not just the man who sells toilet don't just boil down to my job my job is not who I Am\nAnd also in shows that that I needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no she's not joining the guy who sells ... his social on her is not portable\n\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her\nShe told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's a low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't\nEven afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it I'm also she was very angry when the the shoes in head start she was teaching and as a head start teacher\nSome of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying\nWhite Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor and they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nDonald Trump is their middle finger um they see the words and Donald Trump that anybody with ice seas but I think that they\nVoted for him and he had been so loyal to him because that's what\nHe is for them he is a big you\nTo the elites in the United states and he's really effective at that now that is why these middle class guys are ... are very very loyal to Trump he is not as popular among blue collar women\nOr women and blue collar families so there's that sense of not being able to be a full on him because he couldn't get that blue collar breadwinner job and because\nYou're been insulted by lots of cultural artifacts ... a\nHas been written about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election Joan and I would say there are two main lines of argument\nThe forest such a spouse by you and researchers like early ... when we previously featured on hidden brain is that Trump was white working class America's response to yours of humiliation and neglect but there's also another theory and it goes all\nIt back to watch the bunker\nMy mother and his ... year old lady liberty naming off when I watch on high screaming out in the wall and nice instead of water so I mean you're you're filthy [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nJoan how much does racial resentment or xenophobia explained the political choices or the white working class\nI think the economic deprivation to class culture gap and the racial anxiety they're they're different sides of the same coin\nI'm certainly\nFor someone who spent much of my life studying gender and race um where you have 'em where you have white people you've racism that's just the fact\nUm and it is not my job description to condone racism no matter who expresses it and it just not my job to deny id the influence of racism in American Life that would be insane I'm On the other hand um I\nThink that it's a lot easier to cry or someone else's racism then to face your own class advantage\nI think that really for me than no is that um if people can't access their hope they live by their fear and that's the link\nBetween the economic anxiety in the racism and alternative way of giving people a a mechanism for understanding why they feel so\nDistant so economically bereft\nSo and dressed as to say you haven't been will tree then by the economy you haven't done well treated in popular culture\nYou have been disrespected because you're on the different class and it's not because you're white people it's because you are are blue collar people and we're going to stop doing that [noise]\nJoan Williams studies gender glass and work in the United states she's the author of the book white working class overcoming classical listeners in America Jones thank you for joining me today and hidden brain\nMy honor and my pleasure thank you [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] we're going to turn now to another perspective on the motivations are the Trump base the white working class is working class but it is also a white as something traumatic as happened with white voters over the last half century ... no as a political scientist at the University of California\nSan Diego alone was Ogden Hi no she's coauthor of the book white backlash\nImmigration race in American politics says the shift of white voters from the Democratic to the Republican Party has been dramatic over the last forty years\nYes indeed a so one of the biggest shifts they think that we have experienced in the last three to four decades are\nThat racial and ethnic compositions of who makes up democratic and Republican voters today and much of that has to do with the fact that whites are defecting away from the Democratic party um and solidly aligning themselves to the Republican Party whereas the Democratic party\nA is the party that has become much more ethnically and racially diverse today\nSo the fact that people of color are gravitating toward the Democratic party and whites are gravitating towards the Republican Party this isn't a new finding but but you you are humorous that a significant portion of this trend is being driven by one specific political issue\nYes yeah so my colleague as a Valley High now and I that is the main thesis of this of this book is that the\nIssue of immigration is one of the main risk factors that's driving white voters away from the Democratic party and as a result of what we're seeing a we are definitely having this realignment if you will of\nThe ethnic and racial makeup of there are two major political parties\nSo you are not the first callers to identify the immigration matters in politics but it but as I read a book it struck me you've come to a new understanding of just how much immigration\nMatters that's right so it's not it's not this novel finding that immigration matters we've known that for a long time but I think what we're really trying to push forward is that this very essential piece of American politics partisanship and something that we hold so central to every sort of\nExplanation of how people behave in politics that that is really it's being tremendously shaped by how folk think about immigration\n... there's been a long standing debate and political science about the effects of partisanship but I remember talking to a number of experts over the years who've said\nPartisanship and party loyalty is such a powerful force of many of us often arrive at our views on policy matters after we have pledged allegiance to one side or the other it's almost like following a sports team you know why you decided to follow a sports team and then you start to like all the things that\nThe sports team does and this thesis would argue that people's views on immigration are shaped by the partisan loyalties and otherwise you'd people decide that party loyalties fortunate that decides how do you think about immigration\nSome ways you are arguing the opposite you're seeing how people think about immigration\nShapes the way the thing about party yeah so anytime any researchers choose to study partisanship it's always this very intimidating force because as you said there's so much research on it and we feel like this is the one thing that we know so much about but\nAgain when we started doing all this data analysis looking at how American voters behaved over the past Twenty years it was really remarkable that even if we took say\nHow they felt about immigration two years prior to a presidential election or any election that that would still be a very strong predictor of their their vote choice in that\nSubsequent election which means to suggest then that it was immigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\nLet's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed in extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways in would be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that it for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without\nProper documentation and that is a violation of our laws and orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected with what polls show Marissa half white Americans seem to believe that immigrants sort of burden to us society and it's like majority thinks that Latinos after the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself\nThen the question becomes how do you share and not only the risks but also the rewards so we don't get what we get what the banks which is that you know the when things go bad the state has to bail them out and when things go well the banks take the profit\nSo let me ask you about to specific areas that you talk about one is I guess you know one one term forwarded information and communication technology or what we all think of is roughly the digital revolution\nAnd another is um pharmaceuticals and you argue that in both cases there's been a massive government investment in the U. S. and relatively terrible return on investment to the government at least\nIs that still a current argument is it still the case that agencies lake DARPA NSO or parallel versions are still I'm so strongly involved in the innovation or was that a golden era of government investment in research\nThat now needs in your view to be re booted\nSo the first part of the answer is business has changed it's become increasingly financial I this is a huge problem or the two sectors where this is the biggest problem is precisely pharmaceuticals where companies like Pfizer an Amgen a are spending over a hundred percent of their net income on areas like share buybacks and given a path\nAnd of course energy with the big possible green tech revolution of now in terms of the government investments on the one hand they they continue to be absolutely fundamental so and you know the the emerging green economy it was actually ARPA e which came out with one of the biggest innovations and\nBattery storage against fracking which has changed the international or a landscape around energy was also financed by government\nTo what degree was fracking for instance um funded by the government\nTo what degree well you you should remember that the main thing is when so when it was still extremely uncertain extremely risky where there was no private\nGovernment was making those are really into 'em\nSo in terms of the actual amount and percentage of the total that's not really the issue it's who took on their early ... and so that's why we should stop using words like lender of last resort for government financing and use more words like investor first resort because that's in fact the ... the role it plays\nNow on in terms of all these organizations\nLike an ss\nAnd dark but and the national institutes of health there's still spending a lot of money especially in the high risk high in certain phases high capital investment ... however they've been under attack\nBut the real issue shouldn't just be the budget should be the ... the ability of these organizations to continue to really lead the way to have a mission which aren't asked\nIn the budget Appropriations Committee you know what is the economic value going to be because how they thought about net present value in cost benefit and you know economic value as economists think of it in terms of jobs today and patents et cetera then there is no way we would have done them out on a mission that\nActually required a certain level of ambition of imagination a willingness to dream so any country that's interested in tackling areas around climate change or rethinking twenty first century healthcare systems tackling the aging demographic\nCrisis these are all brought challenges which I'm less we really framed them as missions and then we're not going to be able to tackle any of these grand challenges that what we should be learning instead of oh we need more venture capital\nSo you're making an argument that the U.S government um is not getting enough credit for its investment in the past through agencies like DARPA NASA and then in the farm area and so on\nYou also argue separately that they're not getting enough return on investment which but that sounds you know ...\nBut you also argue that the high return and relatively low tax environment for entrepreneurs and investors is not a big driver I'm and I want to know what the evidence is for that I mean\nI look at the U.S as you know one question you ask 'cause we're Europe's Google's what happens differently in the states than in Europe to produce these companies like Google Facebook et cetera there are certainly a lot of people in private equity in venture capital in the start of culture\nWho say that because of the capital gains tax environment because of the carried interest loophole um that that that helps create the very large incentive\nTo make these companies that turned out to be super rich and I'm not even saying these handful of companies that turned out to be super rich or necessarily so good for society I think that's a a bigger discussion for another day\nBut I just want to know what's your evidence that that incentive is not really important and is perhaps a key factor in why this is happening in the U.S and not in Europe\nSo my answer is first of all what happened in the U.S is that there was a system of innovation which lacks in many European countries where you had\nA patient finance but also active mission oriented agencies which really thought about big problems so going to the moon which required many different sectors to innovate including clothing not just here are not X and the instruments including prizes and ... policy which allowed started up the scale up\nRight start up in and out themselves who cares [laughter] because you have a start up what's interesting is again a system and entrepreneurial ecosystem I don't believe in entrepreneurs I Believe an entrepreneurial ecosystems which actually allow start ups to scale up and\nSo you know interestingly Europe has learned the wrong lessons from Silicon Valley and this is partly because of how the U. S. talks\nThe u._s. talks Jefferson but an ax Hamilton [laughter] um so you know Jefferson talked more about getting the state of the way and Hamilton before getting into his do with where ah [laughter] it was buried by the way in the town I grew up in Princeton New Jersey was very much about an active\nIndustrial strategy so Europe interestingly I think I've learned all the wrong lesson China on the other hand\nAnd this is really curious China has learned the right last China's actually doing for the green economy with the U.S government did for the IT revolution at the same time that Trump Donald Trump is dismantling what I call the entrepreneurial state ... ...\nComing up next week on the economics radio will continue this conversation and talk about how you the taxpayer moves out when it comes to for instance pharmaceuticals\nThe well we actually have as a taxpayer paying twice both for the very very very high basic research funding and that's what he's extremely high prices\nIn all kinds of solutions this must have got to have yeah so I think it would be good if I'm Around the world [laughter]\n\nIn the meantime check out the freakonomics radio archive at freakonomics dot com or an apple ... ... or any other ...\nAnd remember to be very nice the public radio station on which you're listening to the show especially if and when they ask for your financial support ... thanks for listening to talk to you next week [noise]\n[noise] ...

A. murals in in post offices across the country\nI mean if you've ever seen them if they're murals all over and they celebrate the dignity of blue collar work you have strong you know effective guys doing important dirty we're building the country and they're really held up\nUm a as kind of one of the ideals of mental illness and um strength and that was very much the\nCultural image of the blue collar guy until ... you know the sixties or seventies when it began to wane and we had a flip in cultural imagery of blue collar men um and I think\nOf this you can see this actually through situation comedies I mean you think of Homer Simpson Joan as\nAn emblematic of the stereotype of white working class men today he's kind of didn't waited I'm Amy Abul sat in sexual or you think of Archie Bunker famous TV character in the Nineteen seventies\nLet me turn yourself I actually shift in Washington and all its ... who also\nWas demoted in fat or also racist and sexist so you have this sharp\nFall from social honor of blue collar men [noise] um and [noise]\nIt's felt very deeply as a personal front\nWhen you speak with people from the working class or one of the things you're saying the book is that they feel that they are often stereotype stereotyped as being poorly educated\nThey're stereotyped as being ugly course they have bad teeth their fat I mean these are very very personal a sort of charge us if you will that out that on some ways must be experienced as a form of humiliation\nI think they are form of humiliation I think the American meat has put a lot of thought into self correcting are stereotypes of the poor and so we it would be considered bad taste in my circles to stereotype the poor um\nI think that we stereotype the working class especially the white working class as sort of stupid racist losers and we use that kind of is the mute button\n'em to say I'm not going to listen to anything they say\nBut that's really a misuse of anti racism as an excuse for snobbery you have elite white people refusing to listen to the legitimate economic complaints\nOf less elite white people on the grounds that those other white people are racist you know there's a lot of racism you know where you have white people you're gonna have racism at the very sad history of this country but\nUsing anti racism as a mute button is not helping the situation\nYou mentioned a Homer Simpson a second ago we actually found some tape a whiz Homer Simpson I Want you to listen to this exchange\n... go to work the it'll do they know I'm ducking out early to take the ... river toward rolling it named ... ... the plane\nIf they don't just ... thing\nThey did a do brewery oh did I say that are just ... ...\nAre you going in the ... [noise]\n\nSo there's a lot to unpack shown and it's not just a the narrative of stupidity but it's also a narrative of people who don't really care about their work with people who are naturally motivated and of course has all packaged in in sort of an\nOverall you know the overall picture is one of the of of humor right I mean the cities are elites making fun of people who are blue collar people [noise]\nThat's right and I mean one of the things that blue collar people are that ethic of self discipline and hard work is so central to them and they're you know they're very proud of their ability to go to these often not very fulfilling jobs\nDay after day after day for forty years straight and I think care of my father in law who went um did they did exactly that he worked in a factory that made\nThose machines that measure the humidity in museums and he was an inspector he hated\nHis job he went to it for forty years and he was proud of doing a good job while he was at work or he was proud of the work that he did and he took it seriously and he worked very hard and she deserved dignity\nFor that and one of the things that I've been trying to explain to people is that\nThese jobs are important jobs you know when I get up in the morning and I turn on the top it's not because of some knowledge workers that water comes out it's because of some blue collar person another thing that strikes me and this is actually from a really fascinating article studying class in sitcoms\nIs Marge in the Simpson is depicted as a smarter and more responsible and more grown up them Homer\nSimpson is and\nThat's a pattern in American sitcoms where I'm In if you look at professional miniature families in sitcoms it's father knows best um and mothers who good support but if you look at working class families in sitcoms\nDot the woman is smarter and often the children are smarter than the gym with his dad so it's like kind of odd class are front\nAnd the gender front exacerbating the class of front\nYou and your husband come from different backgrounds or you're the fourth generation of lawyer in your family and you went to Yale and Harvard\nAnd MIT your husband came from blue collar roots uh he's what you call it a class Mike rent a telling me about a high school reunion he wants attended at and the question she asked if a former classmate and what this exchange reveal to you\nYeah so we went back to his high school reunion and you know I'm the anthropologist he's not so she did what he had come to be used to in upper middle class circles he asked one of his classmates what do you do absolutely the standard question my crowd and uh\nThat his classmate was really offended that classmate put his face very close to my husband's face he got beat red and he said I\nSell toilet and he obviously felt that the what do you do question was a class insult from um virtually the only member of their high school class from this blue collar a rust belt town\nThat had made it um and what they're really shows you what is the again going back to the classroom culture gab well why does my crowd why do we ask each other what do you do what we do because it's a form of social display\nWhat do I do I'm a law professor that this form of social honor [noise] what the I sell toilets comment meant is that I'm not just the man who sells toilet you don't just boil me down to my job my job is not who I Am\nAnd also in shows that that guy needed to keep close to home in a small circle of friends and acquaintances who knew no she's not just the guy who sells ... his social on her is not portable\n\nJones says look how the families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal\nStory about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's sort of low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and height I Can't\nEven afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also she was very angry when the the shoes in head start she was teaching and as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid\nAnd they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor and they're judgmental attitude\nStems from their own self image of themselves as keeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen this kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll\nDonald Trump is their middle finger on they see the warts\nAnd Donald Trump that anybody with ice seeds but I think that they voted for him and he had been so loyal to him because that's what\nHe is for them he is\nA big you to the elites in the United states and he's really effective\nAt that now that is why these middle class guys are being Parsons very very loyal to Trump he is not as popular\nAmong blue collar women\nOr women in blue collar families so there's that sense of not being able to be a full man because you couldn't get that blue collar breadwinner job and because\nYou're been insulted by lots of cultural artifact [laughter]\nA lot has been written about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election Joan and I would say there are two main lines of argument the force that is a spouse by you and research has like early ... whom we previously featured on hidden brain is that Trump was white working class America's response to yours of humiliation and neglect\nBut there's also another theory and it goes all the way back to watch the bunker\nNumber in history like you don't own a lady liberty started having a hard one I watched on high screen without wall and lessons in a while I mean if you're not you're filthy [laughter]\n[laughter] well [laughter]\nYou're either crowds [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo John how much does racial resentment or xenophobia explained the political choices of the white working class\nI think the economic deprivation to class culture gap and the racial anxiety they're they're different sides of the same coin I'm certainly for someone who spent much of my life studying gender and race um where are you\nHave 'em where you have white people you've racism that's just the fact\nUm and it is not my job description to condone racism no matter who expresses it and it just not my job to deny id the influence of racism in American Life that would be insane I'm On the other hand um I\nThink that it's a lot easier to cry or someone else's racism then to face your own class advantage\nI think that really for me the note is that um if people can't access their hope they live by their fear and that's the link\nBetween the economic anxiety and the racism an alternative way of giving people a mechanism for understanding why they feel so\nDistant so economically bereft\nSewing dressed as to say you haven't been weld treating by the economy you haven't done well treated in popular culture\nYou have been disrespected because you're all the different class and it's not because you're white people it's because you are are blue collar people and we're going to stop doing that\n[noise]\nJoan Williams studies gender glass and work in the United states she's the author of the book white working class overcoming classical listeners in America Jones thank you for joining me today on hidden brain\nMy honor and my pleasure thank you\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter] we're going to turn now to another perspective\nOn the motivations with the Trump base the white working class his working class but it is also white and something traumatic as happened was white voters over the last half century ... no as a political scientist at the University of California San\nDiego along with his Austin Hi no she's coauthor of the book white backlash\nImmigration race in American politics says the shift of white voters from the Democratic to the Republican Party has been dramatic over the last forty years\nYes indeed a so one of the biggest shift I think that we have experience in the last three to four decades are\nThat racial and ethnic compositions of who makes up democratic and Republican voters today and much of that has to do with the fact that whites are defecting away from the Democratic party\nUm and solidly aligning themselves to the Republican Party whereas the Democratic party a as a party that has become much more ethnically and racially diverse today\nSo the fact that people of color are gravitating toward the Democratic party and whites are gravitating towards the Republican Party this isn't a new finding but but you you are humorous that a significant portion of this trend is being driven by one specific political issue\nYes yeah so my colleague as was the only high now and I that is the main thesis of this of this book is that the\nIssue of immigration is one of the main ... factors that's driving white voters away from the Democratic party and as a result of what we're seeing a we are definitely having this realignment if you will of\nThe ethnic and racial makeup of that are two major political parties\nSo you are not the first callers to identify the immigration matters in politics but it but as I read your book it struck me you've come to a new understanding of just how much immigration\nMatters that's right so it's not it's not this novel finding that immigration matters we've known that for a long time but I think what we're really trying to push forward is that is very essential piece of American politics partisanship and something that we hold so central to every sort of\nExplanation of how people behave in politics that that is really as being tremendously shaped by how folks think about immigration\nBut there's been a long standing debate and political science about the effects of partisanship but I remember talking to a number of experts over the years who've said\nPartisanship and party loyalty is such a powerful for so many of us often arrive at our views on policy matters after we have pledged allegiance to one side or the other it's almost like following a sports team you know why you decided to follow a sports team and then you start to like all the things that\nThe sports team does and this thesis would argue that people's views on immigration are shaped by that partisan loyalties and otherwise you'd people decide that party loyalties fortunate that decides\nHow they think about immigration in some ways you are arguing the opposite you're seeing how people think about immigration shapes the way they think about party\nYeah so anytime any researchers choose to study partisanship it's always this very intimidating force because as you said there's so much research on it and we feel like this is the one thing that we know so much about but\nAgain when we started doing all this data analysis looking at how American voters behave over the past Twenty years it was really remarkable that even if we took say\nHow they felt about immigration two years prior to a presidential election or any election that that would still be a very strong predictor of their their vote choice and that subsequent election\nWhich means to suggest then that it was immigration that was explaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\nLet's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed an extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways it would be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California taxes we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that document immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that it for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without\nProper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected with walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are burden to us society and it's like majority thinks that Latinos after the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right
