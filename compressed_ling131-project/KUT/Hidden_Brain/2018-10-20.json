C.\nI'm chunk of it on the men from NPR this is hidden brain [noise]\nMore than a decade ago NPR social science correspondent Shankar but then again looking into the unseen influences that shape our lives psychologists even out of town for this behavior racial biases might also be playing licensing David what I found is tarnished me not a lot of people know that this is I fell off my chair when I was one of those things\nThat the world was never supposed to see more here bringing these hidden influences individualized [noise] that's one of the show is all about we uncovered clues to how deep ourselves the archaeology dating [noise]\nPolitics today feels like an endless arguments but is that a bad thing certainly in the United states conflict has been not every time but a lot of the time very productive we discuss the ruins of conflict cannot democracy class the psychological\nDifferences between liberals and conservatives first Disney's\n[noise] um so you you see that and and that we think is part of a deeper pattern of conservatives are a little bit founder of I've kind of predictability a of a standard kinds of things and liberals are a little bit more willing to experiment and this comes through and through taste in a variety of other things\nHere's another example of research has once went into the living spaces of people off assistant dorm rooms and they recorded the items that they saw what was different about living in workspaces of liberals and conservatives\n[noise] well conservatives tended to um have lots of things like a sports memorabilia\nWhereas liberals tended to have more experiential things lots of books lots of CDs especially diverse CDs whereas conservatives were more likely to have things like organize their lives calendars close baskets are also the researchers suggested that liberals rooms were not quite as tidy\nUm or as well lighted as the conservative rooms in office\nDoes have been some research looking at different says in our preferences for different kinds of pets I had to send Jonathan heightened others have explored that liberals and conservatives gravitate of different kinds of dogs\n[noise] different kinds of dogs that has to be the case that conservatives prefer purebreds and I'm a liberals well we'll go with mixed breed dogs um there are some studies that suggest ah how you view pets there isn't that much difference in\nUm in how many have pets both liberals and consider it was like to have pets in about equal level but they might view them somewhat differently um liberals are a little bit more likely to view them as part of the family rather than you know I'm I'm a\nJust a pet or something you have those kinds of very interesting things not just in pet ownership but kind of an orientation to the pet\nThe patterns that John and others have identified a more than just curious\nThese patterns suggest that are monitored enough political differences is wrong in an important way liberals and conservatives don't just have different political preferences and they have different temperament conservatives don't just kind of like lower taxes they also care about what a poetry rhymes\nThat's right um [noise] should poetry rhyme we also asked you know are you more comfortable with novels that and with clear resolution those kinds of things and um you know you can start to see a pattern\nAlready I think has our discussion that it is the case that liberals are more likely to say sure I'm okay with free verse\nI Would ask conservative say now you know we really think there should be a pattern a music should come back to a recognizable melody\nA poetry should crime novels should should wrap up in a way that we are are comfortable with\nTo be clear the difference is John identifies our average is she can certainly have a Republican who lacks free bus and a Democrat who hates jazz\nThe point of this research isn't to stereotype liberals and conservatives but the shows that are political choice is flow from deeply ingrained psychological differences\nMany of us don't realize how our choices as consumers\nThe Cosby by the food we eat the music we listen to that these choices inadvertently reveal our political preferences so I'm happy to tell people on Facebook what kind of music I listen to but I imagine that they wouldn't be able to town from that whether I was a Democrat or Republican\nI asked John about research that suggests you can tell whether someone's a conservative or liberal if you know what kind of movies they watch what kind of food they eat what kind of vacations they take\nVery reasonable that people would not resonate with that line of argument because to them it's not like they say well you know in order to be a good conservative I Need to do this or in order to be a good liberal\nUm so you know they're just being themselves and I think that's that's the real message chairs that\nOur political beliefs are part and parcel of our entire being you know it's it's not like they're completely separate\nI'm just a natural outgrowth of these larger psychological them even physiological tendencies that we've been talking about ... [noise]\n\nLiberals and conservatives differ when it comes to how they see threats endanger here's Wayne LaPierre the former head of the national Rifle Association\nWeaned off in the world that surrounds us there are terrorists in our home invaders drug cartel cards hackers knockout gamers and writers and haters and campus sailors airport killers shopping mall killers\nAnd don't talk about this difference John ah when liberals here this what did they hear when conservative she had this what did they you\nKnow it really is a remarkable a quote I remember John Stewart play this one from the Daily Show and\nAnd after the uh the clip a dish pan back to to Stuart [noise]\nAnd he was hiding\nBehind the desk so you know you get the sense that if you listen to this very long you you're scared of everything the message that I take from this is a you know you play the to liberals and they say well this guy's nuts you know others have told me he's just doing it because he makes millions of dollars from the n._r._a. and and he doesn't really believe it I think he does\nA these threats are very real to him and we're not going to get anywhere unless people who don't feel that way I understand that some people do and likewise Wayne LaPierre of the world need to understand that for some people they just\nYou know they don't see the world as threatening as he does a and they don't think we need to build our society around mitigating those threats\nSo you know with the liberal like Jon Stewart hides behind the desk Bucky what he's doing is he's mocking away ... I can see sort of saying this is ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous to imagine that all these threats basically around that we live in a relatively safe society\nAnd basically what John Stewart his communicating is you know what you're saying doesn't make any sense and what you're saying is it might not make sense to you but it makes sense to end up here\nIn fact like you know one of the favorite things for conservatives to say about liberal says that they just don't get it meaning that you know they don't appreciate that it's a dangerous world and I think that is absolutely\nTrue but it's not that they don't get it because they're being ... up to ... uh or they're not informed\nUm they read about events in the world and they just don't respond to them in the same way and likewise ... liberals rather need to recognize that\nWhile this may seem silly and and you're right about John Stewart mocking ... you know ... how can you uh you know live your life are worried and whatever look to them this is very real and a good citizen is the ... and is prepared to do battle to protect himself as family and society from those threats\nWhat what's interesting about both groups here is that there is a very powerful illusion that we have that the rest of the world sees the world the way that we see the world and if they come to a different conclusion that must be because they're being deliberately juice or somehow deliberately biased as opposed to the idea\nThat people are actually they might be seeing the world the same way but their reactions to the world might actually be very different\nYeah I'm really glad you brought that up a psychologist talked about false consensus\nSo it turns out that if your favorite color is blue you're grossly overstate the percent of the population whose favorite color is\nA is blue so you know I think we need to recognize that we we did a study once as a substance and ... and it turns out that people smell it very differently just because our olfactory systems are structured differently some people's smell it very favorably it smells like kind of cookies or a incense others smell it on favorably it'll smell like\nA like sweat or even urine\nAnd some don't smell it at all and uh uh it's a genetically based difference so we we had a bunch of my graduate student smell this and I remember one fella and he smelled it smelled awful to him\nAnd it didn't smell awful to many of the other graduate students and he was convinced that this was some kind of\nA psychological tricks that we were trying to get him to say well yeah it doesn't smell bad I was one of those studies when in fact he just couldn't believe that people without different and the way they they smelled the substance I think the same thing applies to political beliefs and to the way we we experienced threats in the world\nI remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard the word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of other disbelief that other people might not see and hear the well the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here's Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nYeah constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming track country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shape the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think ah you know immigration defense a police law and order I think that's really at the core of of who we are and have a quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us than it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to\nBe extremely vetted as the president wants to so you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense as if they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place for\nComing on the Internet 'cause he's in Britain that the cactus cafe this Tuesday at six it's all

are more divided than ever are we more divided than ever\nMore divided than ever\nIf you feed our nation is at a breaking point today show may provide you some saw this [noise] historian David moss takes the long view in his book democracy a case study David argues that intense political conflict\nTo the point where it looks like a democracy is about to fail has been with us in the country was\nBorn in fact she argues such conflict far from being a harbinger of do is actually a sign of like ...\nI think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and it is generated tremendous progress\nMany people judge political success or failure based on whether their side wins ... David uses a different men drink he says in the long term real success and failure is about the housing or sickness of democracy itself\nThis composite strengthen our bombs what is it destroyed the fabric that holds us together in today's episode we use American history as a lens to look at how come they can sometimes bring people together and sometimes tell them apart [laughter]\n\n[noise] I started by asking David the obvious question at a time when political conflict seems to be putting the country apart how can you possibly be optimistic\nCertainly in the United states conflict has been not every time but a lot of the time very productive and so I could give you many examples that we could talk about some of them but really if you think about for example in the economic marketplace competition conflict Israeli what drives innovation new ideas and the same thing happens in the political sphere so you have\nA you know you have two parties you have different interest groups you have all sorts of different people trying to fight it out and in the process you've got all sorts of good ideas that are surface and so a conflict competition in the in the political marketplaces is crucial\nDavid says that what matters is not whether this conflict but whether that conflict is constructive or destructive to democracy if you're just focus on the conflict you might not see the real picture\nTo understand the effects of different kinds of conflict I asked him what to tell me about three moments in American history where political disagreements was so intense it seemed like the country might have ...\nIn one case as we will see it in the early ... the first moment who is just a few years after the founding of the new nation\nWe think of today is being an unusually bitter moment in part of [noise] by the founding fathers were happy to ... to\nThomas Jefferson supporters called John Adams hideous and how ... [noise]\nAdam Scott Alexander Hamilton that\nBastard brat off the Scottish peddling [noise]\nThe nasty talk was hardly the rest of it [noise] they were deep disagreements about what it meant to be a country [noise] George Washington said he was mortified that political citing had left the country looking quote ridiculous and contemptible [noise] it did appear to many including Washington that the country might be falling apart\nSo if you look at what was going on this new nation had just declared their independence in Seventeen Seventy six and so you know they were jubilant about having a one this a battle but it turns out that things sort of turn south fairly quickly\nAt the time the new nation was not yet governed by our constitution but by another document known as the articles of confederation\nAnd they really made the state's almost all powerful the states were were sovereign federal government existed but it was very week there was no president there was no Supreme Court just the Congress and the Congress had very limited power for example it could spend and it could borrow but it couldn't tax\nSo the federal government is suing into fault the economy falls into recession a condom is disagree about exactly how severe it was some say it was even worse than the great depression many say it was much less severe but in any case people at the time thought it was a pretty bad\nProblem so they're all these different things going on and that's why Washington is mortified beyond expression\nIn fact he goes on and he said that he's mortified beyond expression that at the moment of our acknowledged independence we look ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of all year and so what he's saying is\nWe we founded this country and it's falling apart\nSo as the state's Iran with one another and we're trying to figure out whether to actually have a workable federal government it turns out that the states come up with something of a compromise in terms of how to build the institutions of what today we think off as the modern federal government\nOne of the first debate was how do you build Congress the small states wanted a Congress that would represent them one vote per state so estate like Delaware or New Hampshire would want that but other states the large states wanted proportional representation representation according to the number of voters\nBut any case as they were trying to figure out how to set up Congress and they came up with an interesting compromise where they set up\nThe house of representatives has is going to be organized by proportional representation and the Senate is going to be two votes per se but what's particularly interesting about this that said I think often\nPeople think about compromise and we think can you hear this all the time today and we need to compromise we need to meet in the middle meeting in the middle is one form of compromise that occurred some time but but I think even more common I think in American history and dealing with the kind of conflict\nThat I see is that you don't meet in the middle you do sort of the best of both [laughter] so what you see it's a small states got what they want to handle large states got what they want and so instead of meeting in the middle are splitting the difference they did both [noise]\nSo the historical moment that mortified Washington also resulted in a model of government that doesn't do it for more than two centuries the concept was painful but productive\nNearly one hundred years later the new nation was tested again\nThis time after the election of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nThe consequences the what they may whether the Potomac prescription in human Gore mental vein avenues pay can fathom death\nWith mangled body whether the last vestige of liberty is sweat in the face of the American continent the south will never submit that humiliation\nAnd degradation of the Naga ration of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd it's not a newspaper and express what many will feeling of the country at the time [noise]\nSouthern states were starting to see it was the eve of the civil war by the civil war abroad\nLiberty to an end David show things have this moment as an example of destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved to the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners\nWho believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the fence fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see if they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just a sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible\nUm what about other means of directing the mind whether meditation perhaps\nYeah so there's lots of research showing that meditative practices can help change how you focus in your ability to focus on what you want and get rid of what you don't\nUm that is true with visualizing positive performance outcomes ahead of time and really you know focusing on why you should succeed right what are the factors that that you've practice well you've you've got this um you've had situations like this in the past and they've gone really wow [noise]\nBut then there are situations that you haven't had in the past\nSituations that are way bigger and more pressurized than anything you could have prepared for\nOn the eve of that championship John ... was ranked a hundred and fifty second in the

the par for Eighteen toll according to see\nBut it was a a devastatingly hard whole no question about it there is obey to the left a burn down to write a bunker sort of out there to the right\nOoh be

never seen it before to attempt to hit the ball as those pure black\nSo here he is pants up and he decided you can't play it so now he gets to go back and drop it first good decisions made on the home maybe that's right but but the lie forced him to make a good decision and here's how you get disastrous it's never just one thing it's always a\nA confluence of two or three or four things that were almost unprecedented\nSo now he drops the ball taking the penalty shot so he's he's three and four out hitting five five is in the bunker [noise]\nNow he's got an easy bunker shot\nBumper shots are not difficult for professional golfers he gets it out to six feet now here's the thing to remember is that he makes that putt\nAnd then he looks around like why is everybody not cheering craze that's

I found is Thomas ... not a lot of people know that this is I fell off my chair and when I was one of those things\nThat the world was never supposed to see more here\nBringing these hidden influenced individualized [noise] that's what the show is all about we uncovered clues to how deep ourselves the archaeology dating [noise]\nPolitics today feels like an endless argument but does that a bad thing certainly in the United states conflict has been not every time but a lot of the time very productive we discuss the role of conflict and democracy plus the psychological\nDifferences between liberals and conservatives first this news\nHere's another example of research has once went into the living spaces of people off assistant dorm rooms and they recorded the items that they saw what was different about living in workspaces of liberals and conservatives\n[noise] well conservatives tended to um have lots of things like a sports memorabilia\nWhereas liberals tended to have more experiential things lots of books lots of CDs especially diverse CDs whereas conservatives were more likely to have things that organize their lives calendars close baskets are also the researchers suggest that the liberals rooms were not quite as tidy\nUm or as well lighted as the conservative rooms in office is\nThis even some research looking at different says in our preferences for different kinds of pets I understand jumping height and others have explored\nThat liberals and conservatives gravitate to different kinds of dogs\n[noise] different kinds of dogs that tends to be the case that conservatives prefer purebreds and I'm a liberal as well go with mixed breed dogs um there are some studies that suggest ah how you view pets there isn't that much difference in\nUm in how many have pets both liberals and consider it was like to have pets are about equal level but they might view them somewhat differently um liberals are live it more likely to be with him as part of the family rather than you know a a a\nJust a pet or so you have those kinds of very interesting things not just in pet ownership but kind of an orientation to the pet\nThe patterns that John and others have identified a more than just curious these patterns suggest that our model of political differences is wrong in an important way liberals and conservatives don't just have different political preferences and they have different temperament\nConservatives don't just scattered like lower taxes they also care about what a poetry rhymes\nAnd that's right um [noise] should poetry rhyme we also asked you know are you more comfortable with novels that in with clear resolution those kinds of things in a you know you can start to see a pattern\nAlready I think has our discussion that it is the case that liberals are more likely they say sure I'm okay with free verse I Would ask conservative say now you know we really think\nThere should be a pattern a music should come back to a recognizable melody a poetry should rhyme and novel should should wrap up in a way that we are are comfortable with\nTo be clear the difference is John identifies our average is she can certainly have a Republican who lacks free bus and a Democrat who hates jazz\nThe point of this research isn't a stereotype liberals and conservatives but the shows and our political choices flow from deeply ingrained psychological differences\nMany of us don't realize how our choices as consumers\nThe Cosby by the food we eat the music we listen to that these choices inadvertently reveal our political preferences so I'm happy to tell people on Facebook what kind of music I listen to but I imagine that they wouldn't be able to town from that whether I was a Democrat or Republican\nI asked John about research that suggests you can tell what if someone is a conservative or liberal if you know what kind of movies they watch what kind of food they eat what kind of vacations they take\nGets very reasonable that people would not resonate with that line of argument because to them it's not like they say well you know in order to be a good conservative I Need to do this or in order to be a good liberal\nUm so you know they're just being themselves and I think that's that's the real message chairs that\nOur political beliefs are part and parcel of our entire being you know it's it's not like they're completely separate and um this is just a natural outgrowth of these larger psychological and even physiological tendencies certain that we've been talking about ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nLiberals and conservatives differ when it comes to how they see threats\nEndanger here's Wayne LaPierre or the former head of the national Rifle Association\nWeight off in a world that surrounds us there are terrorists in our home invaders drug cartel cards hackers knockout gamers and write verse haters and campus sailors airport Keller shopping mall killers\nSo talk about this difference John ah when liberals here this what did they hear when conservative she had this what did they hear\nYeah it really is a remarkable a quote I remember John Stewart play this one from the Daily Show and and after the uh the clip a pan back to to Stuart [noise]\nAnd he was hiding\nBehind the desk so [laughter] you know you get the sense that uh if if you listen to this very long you you're scared of everything the message that I take from this is a you know you play this to liberals and they say well this guy's nuts you know others have told me he's just doing it because he makes millions of dollars from the n._r._a. and and he doesn't really believe it I think he does\nA these threats are very real to him and we're not going to get anywhere unless people who don't feel that way I understand that some\nWell do and likewise the Wayne LaPierre of the world need to understand that for some people they just you know they don't see the world as threatening as he does a and they don't think we need to build our society around mitigating those threats\nSo you know when the liberal like Jon Stewart hides behind the desk boxing what he's doing is he's mocking away let Perry I could see sort of saying\nThis is ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous to imagine that all these threats I basically around as we live in a relatively safe society and basically what John Stewart is communicating is you know what you're saying doesn't make any sense what you're saying is it might not make sense to you but it makes sense to wind up here\nExactly you know one of the favorite things for conservatives to say about liberal says that they just don't get it meaning that you know they don't appreciate that it's a dangerous world and I think that is absolutely\nTrue but it's not that they don't get it because they're being ... up to ... uh or they're not informed um they read about events in the world and they just don't respond to them and the same way and likewise concert liberals rather need to recognize that while this may seem silly and and you're right about John Stewart mocking ... you know how can you\nUh you know live your life are worried and whatever but to them this is very real and a good set of ... is the ... and is prepared to do battle to protect himself as family and society from those threats\nWhat what's interesting about both groups here is that there is a very powerful illusion that we have that the rest of the world sees the world the way that we see the world and if they come to a different conclusion that must be because they're being deliberately choose or somehow deliberately biased as opposed to the idea\nThat people are actually they might be seeing the world the same way but their reactions to the world might actually be very different\nYeah I'm really glad you brought that up a psychologist talking about false consensus\nSo it turns out that if your favorite color as blue you're grossly overstate the percent of the population whose favorite color is a is blue so you know I think we need to recognize that we we did a study once as a a substance and drop them down\nAnd turned out that people smell it very differently just because our olfactory systems are structured differently some people smell it very favorably it smells like kind of cookies or a incense others smell it on favorably it'll smell like\nA like sweat or even urine\nAnd some don't smell it at all and uh uh it's a genetically based different so we we had a bunch of our graduate students smelled us and I remember one fella and he smelled it smelled awful to him\nAnd it didn't smell awful to many of the other graduate students and he was convinced that this was some kind of a psychological tricks that we were trying to get him to say well yeah it doesn't smell bad uh it was one of those studies when in fact he just couldn't believe\nThat people with that different and the way they they smelled the substance I think the same thing applies to political beliefs and to the way we we experienced threats in the world\nI remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard the word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of utter disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here as Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nYeah constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like street engineering at first ...\nNow it's important to stimulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that I just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think ah you know immigration defense or police law and order I think that's really at the core of of who we are not the quarter political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be\nExtremely veteran of the president wants to so you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only make sense does it they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nMore hands on China's central appraisal district now thinking Travis

divided than ever I think\nRepublicans and Democrats now more divided than ever before most whole thing that Americans are more divided than ever are we more divided than ever\nMore divided than ever [laughter]\nIf you feed our nation is that a breaking point today show may provide you some saw this on historian David marsh takes the long view in his book democracy a case study David argues that intense political conflict\nTo the point where it looks like a democracy is about to fail\nHas been with us in the country was born in fact she argues such conflict far from being a harbinger of doom is actually a sign of like ...\nI think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and it is generated tremendous progress\nMany people judge political success or failure based on whether their side wins ... David uses a different men drink he says in the long term real success and\nFailure is about the housing or sickness of democracy itself this comment strengthen our bombs murders and destroyed the fabric that holds us together ... in today's episode and we'll use American history has a lens to look at how companies can sometimes bring people together and sometimes tell them apart\n[laughter]\n[noise] I sounded by asking David the obvious question at a time when political conflict seems to be putting the country apart how can you possibly be optimistic\nCertainly in the United states conflict has been not every time but a lot of the time very productive and so I could give you many examples where we could talk about some of them but really if you think about for example in the economic marketplace competition conflict is really what drives innovation new ideas and the same thing happens in the political sphere so you have\nA you know you have two parties you have different interest groups you have all sorts of different people trying to fight it out and in the process you've got all sorts of good ideas that are surfaced and so a conflict competition in the in the political marketplaces is crucial\nDavid says that what matters is not whether this conflict but what does that conflict is constructive or destructive to democracy\nIf you're just focus on the conflict you might not see the real picture to understand the effects of different kinds of conflict I gave it to tell me about three moments in American history where political disagreements was so intense it seemed like the country might himself\nIn one case as we will see it nearly did the first moment was just a few years after the founding of the new nation\nWe think of today is being an unusually bitter moment in part of [noise] by the founding fathers were happy to sling mud to\nThomas Jefferson supporters called John Adams hideous and how ... [noise]\nAdam Scott Alexander Hamilton\nThat bastard brat of the Scottish peddling [noise]\nThe nasty talk was hardly the rest of it [noise] they were deep disagreements about what it meant to be a country [noise] George Washington said he was mortified that political citing had left the country looking quote ridiculous and contemptible [noise] it did appear to many including Washington that the country might be falling apart\nSo if you look at what was going on this new nation had just declared their independence and Seventeen Seventy six and so you know there are jubilant about having a one this a battle but it turns out that things sort of turn south fairly quickly\nAt the time the new nation was not he had governed by our constitution but by another document known as the articles of confederation\nAnd they really made the state's almost all powerful the states were were sovereign federal government existed but it was very week there was no president there was no Supreme Court just to Congress and the Congress had very limited power for example it could spend and it could borrow but it couldn't tax\nSo the federal government is suing into fault the economy falls into recession a condom is disagree about exactly how severe it was some say it was even worse than the great depression many say it was much less severe but in any case people at the time thought it was a pretty bad\nProblem so they're all these different things going on and that's why Washington is mortified beyond expression\nIn fact he goes on and he said that he's mortified beyond expression\nThat at the moment of our knowledge to independents we look ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of all year and so what he's saying is we ... we founded this country and it's falling apart\nSo as the state's Iran with one another and we're trying to figure out whether to actually have a workable federal government it turns out that the states come up with something of a compromise in terms of how to build the institutions of what today we think off as a modern federal government\nOne of the first debate was how do you build Congress the small states wanted a Congress that would represent them one vote per state so estate like Delaware or New Hampshire would want that but other states the large states wanted proportional representation representation according to the number of voters\nBut any case as they were trying to figure out how to set up Congress and they came up with an interest in compromise where they set up the house of representatives has is going to be organized by proportional representation and the Senate is going to be two votes per day but what's particularly interesting about this and said I think often\nPeople think about compromise and we think can you hear this all the time today and we need to compromise we need to meet in the middle meeting in the middle is one form of compromise it occurred some time but but I think even more common I think in American history and dealing with the kind of conflict\nThat I see is that you don't meet in the middle you do sort of the best of both so what you see is the small states got what they want it and the large states got what they want and so instead of meeting in the middle are splitting the difference they did both [noise]\nSo the histories of mom and dad mortified Washington also resulted in a model of government that doesn't do it for more than two centuries the conflict was painful but productive\nNearly one hundred years later the new nation was tested again\nThis time after the election of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nLet the consequences the what they may whether the Potomac prescription and human Gore Mitt surveying avenues pay him fathom death\nWith mangled body whether the last vestige of liberty is sweat in the face of the American continent the south who never submit that she really\nAsian and degradation of the moderation of Abraham Lincoln [noise]\nAnd it's not in the newspaper express what many will feeling in the country at the time [noise]\nSouthern states were starting to the seat it was the eve of the civil war one of the civil war brought celebrity to\nAn end David still thinks of this moment as an example of destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved to the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession they're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose\nSlavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the fence fair and square", "show_name":
