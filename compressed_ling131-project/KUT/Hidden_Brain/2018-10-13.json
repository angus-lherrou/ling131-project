Thirteen Years later she won again\nAnd what is our fascination with coincidences say about us\nFirst Disney's live from NPR\nLike my problems were sweating and I felt like really high [laughter]\nAnd you know if like if it was going down well or if I was totally blowing it like I didn't know what was going on\nShe was especially nervous about Eric sister Amanda\nYou know I knew when I first read it or the first couple of times that we hung out and stuff and knew that there was a little bit of a ... that every time\nI went over to\nYou know hanging out there for the family that those laws and falling breakdown\nLawrence understood Amanda's attitude she felt the same to what the girls are younger brother would bring home\nMaybe I'll see them next week you know or maybe I'll never see them again you know what I mean so that was kind of like what I had in my head I was like well I Hope that you know I'm thinking I Hope that they know that I'm not going anywhere\nNor I wasn't going anywhere she inadequate getting engaged Eric in fact I had a flat for the romantic bringing her roses comforting her with her favorite movie after a tough day and he would tennis family about all this so why couldn't Lauren breakthrough with Amanda all\nThis time Lauren what's your number whisper\nNow I use it instead of me looking for help I use it to help others that's my way of coming back because the ... community helped me when I needed them\nOne day she started exchanging messages with the woman who was going through a very painful to break 'em\nI sent a big message basically saying that it's OK everyone goes to heartache and there'll be many more people out there\nAs a way to offer encouragement Lauren told a woman about her own happy relationship [noise] the woman has learned about the nicest thing her fiance had done for her Lauren told her about the date ... surprised her with her favorite movie\nOn my birthday [noise] um I had a really bad day at work and there was like one of those days where like\nYou know you wake up and just from the moment you put your feet on the floor like everything goes wrong [laughter] so yeah I was just\nI didn't want to see him that day I was miserable I just wanted to be home like I was just like I just want to go to bed and he surprised more beautiful flowers these roses and he had the notebook which is my favorite like fabulous story of all time\nLauren finished telling a story and waited for\nHer first response after I sent that sorry to hear she's like Oregon [laughter] she's worried I was like how do you know my name [laughter] you know 'cause it's all ... and she was like this is Amanda Amanda\nEric's sister the very person she'd been trying so desperately to connect with in real life [noise] Lawrence says this coincidence changed your whole relationship with Amanda connecting\nRandomly on line and revealing intimate details about themselves and make the two women feel closer [noise] many of us have experienced these kinds of coincidences you bumped into kindergarten friend your\nFirst day in college or you meet someone at a party and discovers\nShe lives in your dad's childhood home in Poughkeepsie lose when these kinds of coincidences happened in our lives the scene like magic but as any mathematician will tell you things that\nFeed unusual or even impossible are actually fairly common mathematician Joseph ... knows this but he was reluctant\nTo write a book that would dispel the magic\nCoincidences are wonderful stories [noise] I don't want to blow the stories in favor of a mathematics because you know I was hitting a nerve I'm going to improve\nIn the end though Joseph did write this book it's called ... book the math and myth of coincidence [noise] it's full of stories of people who find themselves experiencing things that feels so unlikely\nBut you're just major says if you study this for a while the coincidences start to fall into certain categories and the stories we heard from our listeners\nThat's Lauren story about meeting her soon to be sister in law and whisper are all basically the same type of coincidence which in itself is not a coincidence\nIf you categories these coincidences are too um [noise] let's say ten different categories of that particular kind of coincidence meeting a uh an acquaintance or somebody you're familiar with\nIn a very strange place a ... I Would say perhaps eighty percent of all the Clintons as I've heard fall into that category\nYou'll just major says the reason these coincidental speed extraordinary but actually I'm not so extraordinary is because of a common misconception about the number of people we think we actually know\nPeople she says that address book is a essentially\nThe people say no and that turns out for any particular address book is about one percent of the people's actually know in some way in other words a neighbor some of the the bump into in the street bus or the address book is about one percent of the people they know\nAs a result the odds of bumping into someone you know are much greater than you think because you know many more people than you think\n[noise] sometimes math can help us understand the match magic like winning the lottery not just once but several times [noise] that's what happened\nTo a woman named ... get the Nineteen Ninety three I think it was a she won five point four million dollars in a Texas law\nThirteen Years later she won again two million dollars and then a few years after that she won three million dollars and then in two thousand ten she won ten million dollars for\nOne or the odds of one person winning the lottery four times the odds are I think somebody made a calculation and I did too that the odds are about Eighteen ... kills you into one again you have any room\nEighteen Seventy million to one that's in comprehensive them for those who are not mathematicians ... his one followed by twenty four zero\nBut don't just major says we're actually asking the wrong question [noise]\nThink about it this way if I buy a lottery ticket and I asked a question what are the odds that I Will win well it's a very small but if I ask what are the odds that anyone would win the lottery in a country of hundreds of millions of people the odds are actually much higher\nSo if you asked a question slightly differently not what are the odds that Joan ... win the lottery four times but what are the odds that anyone would have been four times you've got a very different answer\nI think I calculated at one point about five million to one which is not anywhere near the ... to ... it's about five or five million to one uh\nAnd that it takes into account the fact that we have thousands of lotteries in the world I mean there are many lotteries and ... and many of them are big time lotteries\nSo five million to one still unlikely\nBut not in comprehensible what makes it even more comprehensible is the fact that most lottery winners don't stop gambling when they went\nAnd you do find that almost everybody who does a win a lottery fairly big time spends all that money order ... much of that money uh in trying to win again\nJoseph ... says this might have been the case with Jon ... author\nYou win five point four million dollars you have\nYou have money to play with you have how money so you're you're you're taking the money to bed again and and\nHer arms of winning a second time or better than most people's because she's got the money to play with humans the second time then she was playing with more money and you can see the um the between the first winning and the second winning is Thirteen Years\nBetween the second winning and the third it was only two years and between the third in the fall if it was only two years as well\nSo does this work and wrap his head around what happened to John cancer but there are some coincidences adjust to defy mathematical interpretation Joseph told me one of his favorite stories about uh nineteenth century French poet and meal to shop\nAnd meals they've shown as a teenager he meets a man by the name of a strange name\nMiss you to vote\nGetting ...\nHe turns out to be an immigrant from England\nFor the ... introduces him through a plum pudding that's a very English dish that's almost unheard of in front of ten years go by\nAnd ... is passing a restaurant in Paris there's a sign on the window saying that they have some putting on their menu but when the ... goes inside he sold the last of the ... was just sold to a gentleman sitting in the back the waiter or close out loud [noise]\nMichigan the photon do would you be willing to share your plum pudding with this gentleman\nThe shop is now at a dinner party with some ... [noise]\nThe host announces an unusual to show it will be served\nDumb putting [laughter] and the ... jokes that one of the guests to arrive must be misused the food [noise]\nWell uh this leaves the door bell rings starting this year the ... an ounce and he answers he's an old man but\nBut the ... recognizes him\nHe looks around and realizes that he's in the wrong apartments are invited to read it or a but nothing [noise]\nAnd the way you do this is you look for the card that has the longest runs\nBecause people's imagination doesn't presume that a fifty fifty probability will produce very long runs and so people's imagine coin flip swell alternate more than the real coin flip oil and that's how you can identify the real one from the fake ones\nAnd I think that illusion that we have that randomness alternate soars more chancy than it actually is that there's less slumping is also the thing that gives rise to these other phenomena where we see randomness in the world and we see more predictability or intention Audi than actually exists in it\nWhen we asked our listeners shared coincidences with us many of them wrote and was really interesting\nExamples of things that happened to them um one thing that I was struck by is is the sense that sometimes a coincidence seems more meaningful to you than it does to someone else so for example when I'm reading a book and I come by and unusually word and then someone in the room mentions that same word\nTo me it feels like it's a sign of something but if I were to tell us a ... you know this happened to me yesterday you'd say yeah sure that's going to happen once every month or so to exactly what you would expect if you believe the loss of probability why do you think it is that coincidences are more meaningful to us than to other people\nThat's a really good question I actually don't know that I've I've seen any research that that demonstrates that phenomena\nThat strikes me as a very compelling hypothesis I think that's probably likely to be right and I think the reason why coincidences seem very meaningful in the first place is that you're trying to explain that\nYou and I both thought of the word propeller at the same time how on earth could that be that Shankar was thinking about propeller at the same time that I was\nThat's what you're trying to explain that you're focusing on that event that just happened to you it has personal relevance to you that makes it impactful but it also makes you somewhat myopic\nAnd what we don't think about our all of the other things that any of us in the room could have thought about at the same time that might also have seen amazing to us we're trying to explain this one thing because it's so\nMeaningful to us it just happened to us other people are less likely to be that myopic and I think and so there would be likely to think about other things I could have happened to which would make it seem less amazing\nTo them we of course experienced this ourselves here the show went to listeners called in with you released seminar coincidence choice I describe these two stories genetic about women who ran into people who turned out to live and the very same\nHouse where the women's parents had grown up so these are not just to coincidences these ... too coincidental that both happened to us it hidden brain what seems truly extraordinary how could that possibly\nBe that you get these two that are exactly the same as magic because what it is Shankar you're magical that's really just all I wanted to hear you saying that ... minutes to get that out of [laughter] eventually we have to give in to the laws of probability there is nothing like that right [laughter] make I Want to thank you for talking with us today\nYeah thanks for having me\nAnd they kept ... he's the author of mind wise how we understand what others think believe field and why [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNot long after I finished talking to ... I came\nBy some new work that made me think about coincidences very differently yeah coincidences can see a magical and they do reveal important things about how our minds work but there's also psychological research that shows coincidences can actually change the direction of our lives and they can be powerfully meaningful\nThe girl that I Am you know we have the same birthday was just going to make a nightmare and say it's very very has the same day Britain is something we discovered that giving\nAt first this may seem that garden variety coincidences do people started dating they discovered they have the same but but there's evidence this may be more than just the kind of coincidence we'd be talking about so far on the show and\nHaving a common but day seems to actually draw people closer to one another\nWhen I first went to a near Harris direct we found out and we have to see her and we call each other very age and I wound up going to that hairstylist for a year even after she which even after we moved I Would drive forty minutes to go get my hair cut by\nSome people see so much significance in shed birthdays or even shed numbers in two days that they select dates were important defense based on those patterns\nEvery day and I have heard plenty Heather Andrea my first time than his birthday with September Twenty one and we had the opportunity to get married on our twenties heaven and without a no brainer we hadn't hit me that\nThe woman you just heard genetic Cravens from Oklahoma City says her love for people with the same bus day extends beyond her love life\nEvery twenty seven and also Teddy Roosevelt birthday and so I've always felt a little extra energy her hand and our head chef\nShed boat stays in fact aren't the only thing that drop people closer to one another Jeanette also find yourself drawn to people who happen to have the same name\nBut I Need another Jeanette ... there's an automatic I'm like oh my gosh\nI Can't believe we have the same name and then if it happens to me that we have the same spelling and I'll tell you the only two people have the same feeling of me but I can tell you who they are and I felt that an automatic ...

modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit\nOf noxious is you know most of us like people who remind us of ourselves whether that's someone with the same name or someone with the same birthday [noise] most of the time such tough love is amusing and homeless maybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves all the people who reminds us of our cells can be a real problem referendum is a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland the study something called implicit equal to ...\nWhich is the idea that many biased things are unconscious and one very well studied biased was ... value and the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same birthday or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals there is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper\nAnd all that now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of\nThings he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples brick looked at a massive\nDatabase of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forty cents is\nJoy examine if they were brought patterns\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working is Baker's butchers working as poachers miners workings minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nAs if I'm trying jacks died and sells it acquires data about its consumers and that enables it to grow by producing more personalized products by advertising more effectively\nAnd that brings in more customers which brings in more data which then and they lived there for them to grow even further and that leads to be be months um status [noise]\nAnd that is what Franklin four and a growing chorus of other critics are so concerned about four recently published a book called world without mind the existential threat of big tech its part memoir part ... greed against the dominance of the big tech firms\nIt's not a particularly empirical book and it's hard to say how much of for his argument was informed by personal experiences like the New Republic disaster it also turns out that for his family in addition to encouraging his love of books encouraged his distrust of monopoly [laughter]\nSo my dad was a a University of Chicago trained lawyer who worked in the antitrust division of the Carter administration and so I grew up in this household where\nAnti trust was part of the family religion and my dad would drive around in a car that had a bumper sticker that said bust the trust on it was a real obsession and passion of his and\nFor a long time he was this was lonely activists who is railing for greater more aggressive enforcement of these laws prohibiting a monopolistic behavior and um I I always admired him for this quixotic stand that he took but I never really fully bought into his arguments\nUntil Amazon got in this fight with the book publishers when it started to hit close to home\nThis was the ... deal yes\nYeah yeah exactly let's just say something about book publishing which is that\nBook publishing is an incredibly or topical industry that they're you know four or five big companies that dominate book publishing and they're often times jerks and so it's hard to have a whole lot of sympathy for the book publishers\nBut suddenly you have these five big companies that were up against one big company which was Amazon and Amazon basically controlled their\nAccess to the marketplace and Amazon was renegotiating their e book contract with the publishers one by one trying to strong arm them with their market power into pricing their books\nThough we're in lower and so to me it was grotesque and ominous that Amazon was just able to use its market power to try to dictate\nTo the publishers and this incredibly aggressive sort of way\nSo where where do you draw the line between winning or competing and being\nEvil right persuade me that it's not just the case of big companies being really good at what they do and winning and you kind of having sympathies with the people who are not winning\nSo my book in some ways is a Valentine to competition that I I Believe that uh marketplaces most healthy when you have a number of market players so I might not love book publishing it might be too concentrated in some ways for my taste but at least they're five companies competing against one another\nFor the marketplace itself I don't like the way that one company is treating me I can always go to another company or if I don't like the goods that one company is selling I can go to another company and the problem with Amazon and the problem with Google and to an extent with Facebook is that they become the only market player and so\nThe choice that we have is consumers is limited and competition is limited\nSo my book is uh my argument is against the big technology companies which\nReally are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\n[noise] as it happens this expansion has just released into Franklin for his own life we spoke to him last year just before his book was being published and there'd been a plot\nTwist the New America foundation supported in my book\nThe New America foundation is a center left think tank devoted to quote renewing\nAmerican politics prosperity and purpose in the digital age it's run by the political scientist Anne Marie slaughter who's a former top official in the Obama State Department\nYeah one of the cool things that New America does is that they give money to journalists who are writing book projects so uh you know I didn't get a lot of money from them but I got a small some and they were especially generous to me because I just been fired from a job at the at the New Republic\nAnd the partial funding for his book about the dominance of firms like Google suddenly became relevant because\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a ... for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually doesn't feel good because you America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavow them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue\nWho was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran something called the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nWe used to having affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of North America and that is Barry Lynn now directs the open markets

I was just like I just want to go back\nAnd he surprised and all these beautiful flowers\nThese roses and he had the no ... which is my favorite like fabulous story of all time\nLauren finished telling her story and waited for\nHer first response after I sent that story to her she was like ... [laughter] she's worried I was like how do you know my name [laughter] you know because it's all non events and she was like this is Amanda Amanda\n... sister the very person should be trying so desperately to connect with in real life [noise] Lawrence says this coincidence changed our whole relationship with Amanda connecting randomly on line and revealing intimate details about themselves and made the two women feel closer [noise] many of\nUs have experienced these kinds of coincidences you bump into kindergarten friend your first day in college ball you meet someone at a party and discover she lives in your\nDad's childhood home in Poughkeepsie when these kinds of coincidence is happening in our lives defeated like magic but as any mathematician will tell you things than the unusual or even impossible are actually fairly common mathematician Joseph\nMazer knows this but he was reluctant to write a book that would dispel the magic\nCoincidences are wonderful stories [laughter] I don't want to blow the stories in favor of a mathematics because you know I was hitting a nerve I'm going for them says\nIn the end though Joseph did write his book it's called ... the math and myth of coincidence it's full of stories of people who find themselves experiencing things that feels so unlikely\nBut you're just major says if you study this for a while the coincidences start to fall into certain categories and the stories we heard from our two listeners as well as Lawrence story about meeting her soon to be sister in law and whisper are all basically the same type of coincidence which in itself is not a coincidence\nIf you categories coincidences are too um [noise] let's say ten different categories of that particular kind of ... meeting a uh an acquaintance or somebody you're familiar with\nYou in a very strange place a ... I Would say perhaps eighty percent of all the ... I've heard fall into that category\nYou're just major says the reason these coincidences feed extraordinary but actually I'm not so extraordinary is because of a common misconception about the number of people we think we actually know\nPeople she says that address book is a essentially the people's they know and that turns out for any particular address book is about one percent of the people actually\nKnow in some way in other words a neighbor some of the the bump into in the street but of the address book there's about one percent of the people they know\nAs a result the odds of bumping into someone you know are much ...\nAnd then you think because you know many more people than you think [noise]\nSometimes math can help us understand the match magic like winning the lottery not just once but several times [noise] that's what happened to a woman named ... get the\nNineteen Ninety three I think that was a she won five point four million dollars in a Texas law Thirteen Years later she won again two million dollars and then a few years after that she won three million dollars and then two thousand ten she won ten million dollars for\nOne or the odds of one person winning the lottery four times the odds are I think if somebody made a calculation and I did too that the odds are about Eighteen ... billion to one against this happening\nEighteen Seventy million to one that's in comprehensive for those who are not mathematicians ... his one followed by twenty four zeros [noise]\nBut you just measure says we're actually asking the wrong question\nI think about it this way if I buy a lottery ticket and I asked a question\nWhat are the odds that I Will win well it's a very small but if I ask what are the odds that anyone would win the lottery in a country of hundreds of millions of people the odds are actually much higher\nSo if you asked a question slightly differently not what are the odds that Joan ... there will win the lottery four times but what are the odds that anyone would win four times you've got a very different answer\nI think I calculated at one point about five million to one which is not anywhere near the ... to ... it's about five five million for one uh and that it takes into account the fact that we have thousands of lotteries in the world\nI mean there are many lotteries and ... and many of them are big time lotteries\nSo five million to one still unlikely\nBut not in comprehensible what makes it even more comprehensible is the fact that most lottery winners don't stop gambling when they went\nAnd you do find that almost everybody who does a win a lottery fairly big time spends all that money or ... much of that money uh in trying to win again\nJoseph ... says this might have been the case with Jon ... author\nYou win five point four million dollars you have\nYou have a money to play with you have how money so you're you're you're taking the money to bed again and and\nHer own of winning a second time or better than most people's because she's got the money to play with humans the second time then she's playing with more money and you can see the um the between the first winning and the second inning of Thirteen Years\nBetween the second running in the third it was only two years and between the third in the fall if it was only two years as well\nSo does this major can wrap his head around what happened to John cancer but there are some coincidences that just defy mathematical interpretation Joseph told me one of his favorite stories about uh nineteenth century French poet and meal to shop\nAnd meals they're shown as a teenager he meets a man by the name of a strange name miss you to vote\nGetting ...\nHe turns out to be an immigrant from England and\nFor the ... introduces him through a plum pudding that's a very English dish that's almost unheard of for ten years go by\nAnd ... is passing a restaurant in Paris there's a sign on the window saying that they have slum putting on their menu but when the ... goes inside you saw the last of the plum pudding was just sold to a gentleman sitting in the back\nThe waiter or calls out loud [noise]\nMisuse the photon do would you be willing to share your plum pudding with this gentleman\nThe shop is now a dinner party with some friends the host announces an unusual to show it will be served\nDumb putting [laughter] and the ... jokes that one of a gift to arrive must be misused the food [noise]\nWell uh the doorbell rings starting this year the fortune ... an ounce and he says he's an old man but um [noise]\nBut ... recognizes him of the books are round and realizes that he's in the wrong apartment visual invited to read it or [noise] or but nothing [noise]\nAnd the way you do this is you look for the card that has the longest runs because people's imagination doesn't presume that a fifty fifty\nProbability will produce very long runs and so people's imagine coin flip swell alternate more than the real coin flip well and that's how you can identify the real one from the fake\nOnes and I think that illusion that we have that randomness alternates or as more chancy than it actually is that there's less Clampitt there's also the thing that gives rise to these other phenomena where we see randomness in the world and we see more predictability or intention Audi than actually exists in it\nWhen we asked our listeners shared coincidences with us many of them wrote and was really interesting\nExamples of things that happened to them um one thing that I was struck by is is the sense that sometimes a coincidence seems more meaningful to you than it does to someone else so for example when I'm reading a book and I come by and unusual word and then someone in the room mentions that same word\nTo me it feels like it's a sign of something but if I were to tell us a ... you know this happened to me yesterday you'd say yeah sure that's going to happen once every month or so to exactly what you would expect if you believe the loss of probability why do you think it is that coincidence is a more meaningful to us than to other people\nThat's a really good question I actually don't know that I've I've seen any research that demonstrates that phenomena but that strikes me as a very compelling hypothesis I think that's probably likely to be right and I think the reason why coincidences seem very meaningful in the first place is that you're trying to explain that\nYou and I both thought of the word propeller\nAt the same time how on earth would that be that Shankar was thinking about propeller at the same time that I was that's what you're trying to explain that you're focusing on that event that just happened to you it has personal relevance to you that makes it impacts fall but it also makes you somewhat myopic\nAnd what we don't think about our all of the other things that any of us in the room could have thought about at the same time that might also have seen amazing to us we're trying to explain this one thing because it's so\nMeaningful to us it just happened to us other people are less likely to be that myopic I think and so there would be likely to think about other things I could have happened to you which would make it seem less amazing to them\nOf course experience this ourselves here are the show went to listeners called in with you at least similar coincidence stories\nI describe these two stories genetic about women who ran into people who turned out to live in the very same\nHouse where the women's parents had grown up so these are not just too coincidental ... too coincidental that\nBoth happened to us it hidden brain what seems truly extraordinary how could that possibly\nBe that you get these two that are exactly the same it's magic is what it is Shankar you're magical that's just all I wanted to hear you saying that twenty minutes to get that out of [laughter] eventually we have to give in to the laws of probability there's nothing like that right [laughter] make I Want to thank you were talking with us today\nYeah thanks for having me\n... is the author of mind wise how we understand what others think believe field and why [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nNot long after I finished talking to the cat play a key by some new work that made me think about coincidences\nVery differently [noise] yes coincidences can feel magical and they do reveal important things about how our minds work but there's also psychological research that shows coincidences can actually change the direction of our lives and they can be powerful a meaningful\nThe girl that I'm dating now we have the same birthday was just going to make long nightmare and say it's very very has the same day is something we discovered second lane\nAt first this may seem that garden variety coincidences to people started dating they discovered they have the same thing but there's evidence this may be more than just the kind of coincidence we'd be talking about so far on the show and\nHaving a common but day seems to actually draw people closer to one another\nWhen I first went to a near Harris direct route and we had a thinker and we call each other very ... and I wound up going to that hairstylist for a year even after she even after we moved I Would drive forty minutes to go get my hair cut by\nSome people see so much significance in shed birthdays or even shed numbers into but days that they select dates were important defense based on those patterns\nI birthday and I have are twenty seven and my first time than his birthday with September Twenty one and we had the married on August twenty seven and without a no brainer that and that\nThe woman you just heard genetic Cravens from Oklahoma City says her love for people with the same bus day extends beyond her love life\nEvery twenty seven and all that and he writes enough birthday and so I've always felt a little extra energy her hand and for him or her shed\nShed book stays in fact aren't the only thing that drop people closer to one another Jeanette also find yourself drawn to people who happen to have the same name\nWhen I Need another ... there's an automatic I'm like oh my gosh I Can't believe we have the same name and then it happens to me that we have to hang selling and I'll tell you only black people have the same battling with me and I can tell you who they are and I felt that automatic ...
