the the dot com\nI'm not going to be done to them and from NPR this is hidden brain [noise]\nMore than a decade ago NPR social science correspondent Shankar but then again\nLooking into the unseen influences that shape our lives psychologists even have a term for this behavior is racial biases might also be playing licensing David what I found his tarnished me not a lot of people know that this is I fell off my chair when this was one of those things\nThe world was never supposed to see more here bringing these hidden influences into the life that's what the show is all about we uncovered clues to how deep ourselves the archaeology dating I\nToday on the show tail just people who have too little too much we hear about the psychology of scarcity this type of scarcity is almost like an alarm goes off in the head and the psychology of access\nThe lives of the richest people in the world are so different it's almost unimaginable first this news\nPaying that [noise] and then I just stopped pay\nBecause I couldn't afford to pay\nAnd pay that\nCard off until I got my tax refund the following year\nBy the time I pay that off those over eight hundred dollars for five hundred dollar card\nMore and more Randy fat trapped by debt she no longer had options that came down to pay the bills or feed the kids\nAnd it's just overwhelming trying to juggle all of those things and still maintain a a a certain state of mind so that my children and see me struggle\nIn retrospect round you can see the mistakes you made\nIf she had made a budget for the whole month she might have remembered she needed to account for gas if she has focused on the big picture you might not have maxed out a credit card she couldn't afford to pay back\nWhy did ground to make these mistakes\nIt's easy to say she was being irresponsible\nShould always be careful and conscientious if something causes her to behave differently [noise]\nDon't understand why she did this I Want to take you to a completely different time and place because it reveals something important about ground the story\nIt's Nineteen forty four World War\nTwo was nearing its end Europe is on the verge of mass famine aid workers desperately need guidance on how to bring people back from the brink of starvation\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota thought they could help they launched a year long experiment as a two thousand two documentary made by the university explains the volunteers were conscientious objectors who student wanted to serve the country the experiment\nThe volunteers had to go on a starvation diet\nThirty six young men most of the Quakers Mennonite or church of breath remembers moved into the south tower of the memorial stadium which would be their home for a year many took courses at the university even as they grew thinner and thinner\nThe young men became walking scare crows some group so we can bony they couldn't sit without cushions or raise their arms to wash their hair\nI remember being a little bit about critical of guys that very part who had liquor pledge I thought that was really pretty crude\n... was one of the volunteers he recalled the experience and the documentary\nBy the time river and or above the [laughter] the second part of it I was very good right so you're just day to her brief single gallery in your hand on\nThe results of the starvation experimental eventually published and remaining important academic reference on nutrition Simon and eating disorders but recently to researchers became intrigued with a Seventy year old study for a completely different reason they were interested in what the lack of food did\nNot to the body parts of the mind I think this type of scarcity is is almost like an an alarm goes off in the head and saying hey we're really need this thing address we really need to address\nThis is centered on the line nothing an economics professor at Harvard she and a colleague as harsh a\nFear a psychology professor at Princeton headed to the brewing did went like this when you see is that something important is missing in your life\nYour brain starts to focus on that missing thing when you really desperate for something you can focus on its obsessively there's no room for anything else the researchers were just beginning to explore their\nHypothesis when a colleague mentioned the long ago Minnesota starvation experiment ended on remembers being immediately fascinated by the study and how the lack of food affected the minds of the men\nThey basically were very hungry and could could and stuff and but you know you know in some sense you'd think giving them to come to the drug there'd be distracted\nThe things that in fact both subconsciously the level of immediate reaction and their choice of the conversation largely goes around food if I was actually it was sort of tragic comic um in Bay plans to open restaurants to become restored tourists but he's memorized recipes compared food prices have different newspapers\nThat's what they're doing the whole time to sit around and looking at food related issues\nEven intentional diversions didn't work hunger and food had captured their minds\nThat at some point of experiment or is just felt sorry for them to submit to distract them with a movie since I was just among those were the showed me this movie that couldn't care less about the love scenes I wanted to see the meals\nAnd are suddenly realized she had seen the same kind of behavior in a completely different setting he'd done a lot of research on the effects of poverty and he knew poor people who sometimes to behave like the starving men in Minnesota\nThe poor people who are lacking financial resources\nFrom a very hard to think about anything but what we spend a lot of the resources a lot of attention on financial juggling\nStarvation make people upset super food poverty make people obsess over how they were going to make ends meet how to make it to next week\nWhat's in common in both cases of your head as busy with the thing you're going to have enough votes\nTo do research has found they were on to something maybe they thought the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity like tunneling in on the thing that's missing center says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective\nPicture that you have somebody from twenty five thousand years ago it was basically hunter gatherers and who might need to do a variety of things such as you know get water do you know a lot of resources are needed when they get hungry for the evolution and it's just the once having to learn that says hey really\nFocused on getting food into the system and that I think is the basic scarcity instant poor hungry and then this things started going off in the head thing\nDo you realize we're hungry and I mentioned we're hungry we're hunger and it keeps calling out to you\nFor Brandi drew the alarm might have sounded like this you don't have\nThe necessities your family needs you need to stock stock up now you need these things and when she bought the beach the family size pack of toilet paper the snacks and juice boxes for the kids the alarm temporarily went silent [laughter]\n\nI felt really\nThat those things that's smart things that didn't have to worry about\nBut the reprieve from the alarm came at a huge cost\nBut then like I said two days later it's like okay wait a minute why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas\nThe answer to that question central another I Believe has to do with what's Cassidy did to brandy she was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else\nThere is a technical term for this it's called bandwidth\nIf you're downloading a movie on your home life I find that you might find your email runs a little slower\nThe movie is hogging all the available ... send them in as our say our minds work exactly the same way if your mind is consumed with thoughts about something there isn't room to think about other stuff\nScarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have it doesn't leave room for anything else\nAs our sense that's a simple way to demonstrate this you imagine trying to hold an eight digit number in your head\nAnd if I simply ask you to keep in mind you know two six seven months before that just leaves you with us able to extend to other stuff you eat less well you'll pay attention to those things so [laughter]\nAs you're saying that he just now and now I I didn't hear the rest of us like they have to remember that how are you guys have your number one stand our ground [laughter] but then the sense that kind of a metaphor so when you were busy juggling resources worrying about you know how am I going to be for dinner and if I pay for dinner with other people's money because school trip\nJust keeping an eye digit number in your head [noise]\nThere's a reason our minds with this way tunneling into something makes you focus on it everything inside the town becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside of the top\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you could find the best deals the cheap tube of toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor is often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy two parents will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework the other of other things that make you know live complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even for their scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens\nInsight about how your own mind is changing Katie had no awareness that she was heading down a dangerous path and it became obvious to her only when it finally affected ... [laughter]\nI started to notice that I was like nearly missing things as I was reviewing for example um I admitted a diabetic and I almost didn't order insulin for them but I did order the insulin\nUm but I was like I don't think I can keep up with this any more 'cause if you don't give a diabetic insulin especially if they're type one they can have very fatal circumstances I'm In the hospital and get really high higher blood sugars that can cause them to have an acidosis and end up on a ventilator [noise]\nSo [noise] um I turned myself in at the point that I saw that it was starting to affect my work\nIn two months of the residency program Katie's body and mind had widowed things had gotten so bad she had to go to a residential treatment center Mm Katie struggled with two\nThings her body was desperately in need of nutrition and her mind she had to find a way to stop the intrusive thoughts that we're consuming her she had to\nLearn how to do that because we weren't allowed to exercise we weren't allowed to stand we weren't even allowed to do jumping jacks are squad we had to just sit and\nKatie's mind was filled with angry and impatient sons\nAt first I felt like I felt useless because they thought you know if I'm not doing something productive\nWhat is my purpose in life\nBut gradually as the program literally forced her to do nothing Katie started to emerge from the tunnel she ... she had been so narrowly\nRelentlessly focused on one goal doing when at work that she'd ignored the very things she needed to succeed moments of relaxation like watching TV or in her case painting\nKitty had loved odd as a child but she had put it aside because she thought it wouldn't help her become a better doctor\nI'm kind of the type of person that just like to study and then do after I had like mastered it from studies point of view and so to just do something without instruction\nIs it feels very vulnerable to me but it ended up kind of being my saving grace in my recovery and um I've actually created an art room in my house I changed my office from my work grow into an art room\nAnd it has pains and water colors and talks and everything you can imagine and I try to go in there once a week and to create something without any expectation just for the purpose of creating it because they can\nKatie eventually returned to her residency Programme with a new outlook she started doing something that as our and send them to recommend\nTo all busy people she actually pencils time into our schedule to do nothing\nOne of the big things I've done is kind of have a date night with myself once or twice a week\nRight as a schedule off the night and I won't do anything with anyone else then I'll just be free for me to do what I feel like it might be watching a movie it might be taking a soak in the tub and reading a book or being in my art room and painting whatever comes to me\nUm but I I Do like I prioritize that and I actually won't accept plans with friends generally when I Do that so that's one of the things they do\nKatie is consciously freeing up back with and something strange just happened to she's done so the less consume she feels about work the better she dies at work\nHonestly like it's kind of incredible but at work my brain has increased its capacity\nFor fault I Am able to hold so many more things in my consciousness at once and manage them I've just seen a really huge improvement in my ability to enjoy being in the company of others to enjoy like occasions and to enjoy my work and do while at my work\nOne of the psychological studies and a scarcity and bandwidth a relatively new the ideas are actually ancient\nKeep difficult things in one part of your life from contaminating everything else be present\nThe you have a big deadline or tomorrow for something that you go home and you're spending the evening with your kids [noise]\nAnd in that moment you're not present focused at all what you're focused on is that deadline\nYou you may go through minutes where you didn't hear what your kids were saying to you\nTo your mind keeps going through this other thing\nTunnel vision is not in itself a good thing or a bad thing\nShutting off distractions can be helpful at times the question is do you know when you're inside the tunnel\nTo me that's exactly the heart of managing scarcity it's recognizing when you try to do something related to your scarcity\nWhere you really want to use that instinct and when you made a conscious decision to do something else where what you really need to do is to not have it in food on that something else you're home you're with your kids you chose to be a parent's for that three hour period you really don't want scarcity did then\nOf course it's easy to say bill free time at your schedule stay present with your family take a vacation these strategies presume you have choices\nYou can't say I've had it with being lonely and let it take a vacation from being lonely\nNo choice and to me loneliness in poverty\nOr the forms of scarcity the field the biggest because well all these forces are put at play there is no relief though there's no escape mechanism\nAnd other and send the what policymakers to design solutions that recognize how scarcity creates traps from which many people may not be able to extricate themselves and they want the rest of us to stop preaching to those in poverty\nIf you look up above the poverty we awesome couldn't found a little bit that comes to help the poor will be a ... mix for the show up in time but they do the right things\nIt from the perspective you we've taken a look scarcity in some sense if I'm very busy juggling a very complicated life insisting that I show up at the office of faith in fatal five\nJust not doing the ... you could have just hard to manage I'm you know it's just the transportation reliable and that could have been to Libya babysitter I wouldn't make mistakes that it's not clear cutting the quotes about ... and helped me at all just makes my life all the more complicated\nWhen people in poverty fail or make mistakes the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots there was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes which is bad pilots center says a big reason add travelers become safer in recent decades is\nThat there's been a shift in thinking about such mistakes designers have made cockpits fault tolerant rather than trying to find perfect pilots cockpits and not designed to account for human era the goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes\nIt's ironic that when we design cockpits entire mantra fault tolerance seems so intuitive\nBut when you design social policies nobody's out there talking about let's make the salt tolerant I mean you know what people have a lot on their mind their band with tax they're going to make mistakes let's make sure this program as robust when they do make that mistake it's just not the way we think if I offer training program I don't sit there and say\nUh let me make sure you know what's gonna happen [noise] this is for low income individuals surely they're going to miss a few days\nBecause you know it's hard to get get the classroom times or other things on their mind\nSo let me designers curriculum so that it's in attendance tolerant so even if somebody Mrs three days in the world to be able to come on that fourth day and still feel caught up in fact a a a a training curriculum is often quite the opposite if you missed three days in a row it's an invitation to miss the fourth day you're not going to get anything\nBrandi drew eventually turned her life around she found a low income assistance program that offered her how she walked with a financial accounts that are gay for strategies for budgeting our money and keeping track of long term priorities\nActually have a calendar now that I write down everything to make campaign things on the correct time\nIt's taken time and little steps but brandy\nIs no longer in the scarcity tunnel she's been working for a few years now actually has savings\nI Know that if anything happens God Forbid if I lose this job I Know that I can survive for at least six months if I have to look for another\nDown in center themselves say that they are constantly trying to keep the lessons of scarcity front and center in their own lives as a busy academic Eldar has come up with a rule when it in addition to an event two months down the road comes along the U.S themselves whether he would attend the event\nIf it were tomorrow you know the answer is no he declined the invitation because his life is not going to be any less hectic two months from now presenting bandwidth\nSticks conscious effort most of us are included are going to violate the rules will say yes to new commitments when we don't have the time or put a lot of credit card when we can't afford it in those moments it's important to look up\nTo notice we're inside the tunnel\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity to access\nIt turns out that having too much\nYou can have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece it here so it brings to kind of suspicion why are you being nice to me or you just trying to give me give you something I'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain this\nBasketball program but hardly delete it produced only one NBA player in its history Ingram was a three point shot specialist can she left the American as it's different leading all time score but that was not enough to get drafted into the NBA so\nHe entered the NBA's minor league which at the time was called the D. lead D standing for development since change its name and a sponsorship deal to the gene league but the G standing for gator aid\nAnyway Andrea Ingram entered the D league with the hopes of being called up to the NBA\nYou end up staying for ten years\nAlmost nobody stays in the league for ten years it pays so poorly roughly twenty five thousand dollars a season the most young players give it a year or two before going to play pro in Europe or elsewhere\nIngram tried Australia briefly didn't like it plus he wants to stay nearby just in case the NBA finally came calling\nThere were many times where I was you know ready to just to turn the other way and do something else and uh you know wife and kids family you know the the legal Julie is not paying you much like you know you need to do something else like I came to that point so many times and you know something kept me going every time\nLast year he played for a team called the south bay Lakers they're owned by the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers which you've probably heard of Ingram led the G League in three points shooting percentage but still he was thirty two years old by now and still in the ... league for extra money he tutor kids in math\nAt the end of the season he was called in for his regular exit interview\nSo you know I'm thinking All right this is you know the same old thing but then we did upstairs we get in this big conference room and not only use the gym and head coach there our president is there and I'm like okay this is a bit different I've done this before and usually our president's not hear\nThe president he's talking about is the president of basketball operations not from the south bay Lakers but for the Los Angeles Lakers\nMagic Johnson you've probably heard of him too\nSo you know heart is kind of racing at that moment and then they tell me the news\nThe news was that the LA Lakers with just two games left in their season we're calling Andrea Ingram up to play he would make his NBA debut at age thirty two\nBut just everything that I was feeling of exactly what you thought or would anybody with thing no one my story nor my situation I just didn't let it out like my wife and uh my mom did when I told him to lose they let it out they just let it be raw and you know they're real emotion that you know people love to see\nUm I was little bit more to do but was feeling at all inside and so you know immediately after that though my first thought goes to okay you who do we play again tomorrow\nThey were playing the Houston Rockets late in the first quarter Ingram finally got his chance to play in the NBA\nLike you know I think before I got there is in the night before was when all the emotions were running wild and I'm not sure how to feel than you so excited yet nervous and all these other things [noise]\nBut when it came time for the actual game it really turned into basketball very quickly for me and made things a whole lot easier how easy was it\nI\nThink I'm scored Nineteen points that night including for three point shots it was one of the best debuts in Lakers history as one of the most amazing debuts ever thirty two year old\n... [noise]\nThe crowd began chanting envy the MVP\n[noise] so [noise]\nUm we had no idea of the reach of this until my brother and my niece had called and told me they said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're blowing up Instagram you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\nSo I Know that your great three point shooter um historically great so but forgive me for saying this year's shot looks\nA little bit ugly it sort of you know with the um it's you know it's a little off balance and I know it works but I'm really curious to ask you I don't mean just to insult you it's an insult with a question do I get it I think that maybe\nIs part of what's kept teams are in the past ... from giving you a shot at the NBA and and I asked is thinking about um the story about Jeremy Lin knew so many teams overlooked and they later admitted\nThey overlooked him because he was an Asian guy and he fit the template of what you know an NBA player was and I'm curious if whether you think that you're on traditional shot may have a hurt us in some way even if just like perception wise\nYou know what that means a good question I don't think so I Would say the\nGray hair probably has more to do with it but then I guess maybe the the awkwardness of the shot or\nNot not so much the awkwardness of it but the release point of it because it's a bit lower than most guys I'm already not the tallest guy so maybe\nThere is worry about well hey this shot is going to get blocked that are leaving the guys are too athletic for him to get that off so maybe that was a maybe that was a thought to be honest with\nYou All right so here's the big question um what's your future [noise]\nYeah so right now I'm uh my age and is in talks with a you know different teams were trying to get into a training camp right now that's the goal and you know hopefully there'll be some new soon to be but ah no word yet\nSo what happens if you know you don't get in a training camp you don't get to play for an NBA team what do you do this coming season [noise]\nYeah well I'm ... definitely be the G League again um you know ... and it it could be another season of it I mean the job for me is simple you know just stay ready but the goal is and we will be continue into play that that much I can tell you\n[noise] it's interesting you know as a sports fan I've been you know my whole life seeing people trying to squeeze meaning out of sports beyond the game itself and a lot of times it feels kind of force\nBut it strikes me that your story was really different what is it a lesson that we maybe should take from your story\nWhat I Would like for people to get out of it the most is that it it it wasn't just that you know I stuck with it all the way through and was happy about it all the time I've definitely had doubts ahead [laughter]\nYou know disbelief discouragement you know you don't get to something or any dream or anything we're having um just you know Scott Free but I think that part about it is is the real is part\n\nLease joined me and wishing on gay Ingram the best of luck [noise] whatever happens next\nTo play us out today here's his family's gospel group Maggie Ingram in increments this song is called appropriately enough\nWork until I die [noise]\nI'm Stephen ... and that was kind of training thanks so much listening we will be back next week hand if you don't want to wait that long you can find our entire freakonomics radio broadcasts archive\nAt freakonomics dot com foreign stature and you can always subscribe and listen to the latest three months of episodes and any podcast platform thanks [laughter]\nThis is Austin's NPR station K.

and he knew poor people who sometimes behave like the starving men in Minnesota\nThe poor people who are lacking financial resources from a very hard to think about anything but we spend a lot of the cognitive resources a lot of attention on financial juggling\nStarvation made people upset so for food poverty make people obsess over how they were going\nMake ends meet how to make it to next week\nWhat's common in both cases of your head as busy with the thing you're going to have enough of\nThe two researchers felt they were on to something maybe they thought the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity like tunneling in on the thing that's missing center says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective\nPicture that you have somebody from twenty five thousand years ago who is basically a hunter gatherers and who might need to do a variety of things such as you know get water do or you know\nA lot of resources are meeting when they get hungry sort of the evolutionary system once having to learn that says hey really focused on getting food into the system and that I think is the basic scarcity and the poor hungry and then this thing starts going off in the head saying\nDo you realize we're hungry and I mentioned we're hungry we're hungry if keeps calling out to you\nFor Brandi drew the alarm might have sounded like that you don't have the necessities your family needs you need to stock up on TALK now you need these things and when she bought the beach the family size pack of toilet paper the snacks\nAnd juice boxes for the kids the alarm temporarily went silent [laughter]\n\nI felt really that those things the smart things that didn't have to worry about\nBut the reprieve from the alarm came at a huge cost\nBut then like I said two days later it's like okay wait a minute why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas\nThe answer to that question central and now that I Believe has to do with what's cash that he did to brandy she was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else\nThere is a technical term for this it's called bandwidth\nIf you're downloading a movie on your home why find that you might find your email runs a little slower the movie is hogging all the available banquet ... say our minds work exactly the same way if your mind is consumed with thoughts about something there isn't room to think about other stuff\nScarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have it doesn't leave room for anything else as our says there's a simple way to demonstrate this imagine trying to hold an eight hundred number in your head\nAnd if I simply ask you to keep in mind in those two six seven seven one six for that just leaves you with us able to control of the stuff you use less well you'll pay attention to those things are so\nAs you're saying that they're just now and now I I didn't hear the rest of us like driving remember that's how are you guys have your number one starts around [laughter] but in a sense that's kind of a metaphor so when you were busy juggling resources worrying about you know how we're going to be for dinner and if I pay for a little bit of money because school trip\nJust keeping it does your number in your head\n[noise] there's a reason our minds with this way tunneling into something makes you focus on it everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside the top\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals the cheap cheap toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like a utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the price was in a number and the prices and figure out a few bucks two cars will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework because of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay your bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is a track scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice to poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be like in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't be attention to what's actually being set the conversation falters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward or flat footed what happens\nTo find a way to stop the intrusive thoughts that we're consuming her she had to\nLearn how to do that because we weren't allowed to exercise we weren't allowed to stand we weren't even allowed to do jumping jacks are squat and we had to just sit and\nKatie's mind was filled with angry and impatient sons\nAt first they felt like I felt useless because I thought you know if I'm not doing something productive what is my purpose in life\nBut gradually as a program literally forced to go to do nothing ... started to emerge from the tunnel she ... she had been so naturally\nRelentlessly focused on one goal doing what it was the sheet ignored the very things she needed to succeed moments of relaxation like watching TV or in her case painting\nJudy had loved out as a child but she had put it aside because she thought it wouldn't help her become a better doctor\nAnd kind of the type of person that just like to study and then do after I have like mastered it from the studies point of view and so to just do something without instruction\nIs it feels very vulnerable to me but it ended up kind of being my saving grace in my recovery and um I've actually created an art room in my house I changed my office from a word grow into an art room\nAnd it has pains and water colors and talks and everything you can imagine and I try to go in there once a week and just create something without any expectation just for the purpose of creating it because they can\nJudy eventually returned to her residency Programme with a new outlook she started doing something that Eldar and send them to recommend\nTo all busy people she actually pencils time into our schedule to do nothing\nOne of the big things I've done is I kind of have a date night with myself once or twice a week right as a schedule off the night and I won't do anything with anyone else then I'll just be free for me to do what I feel like it might be watching a movie it might be teaching a soak in the tub and reading a book\nOr being in my art room and painting whatever comes to me\nUm but I Do like I prioritize that and I actually won't accept plans with friends generally when I Do that so that's one of the things they do\nA Katie is consciously freeing up back with\nAnd something strange just happened to she's done so the less consume she feels about work the better she does that work\nHonestly like it's kind of incredible but at work my brain has in ...\nFor fault I Am able to hold so many more things in my consciousness at once and manage them I've just seen a really huge improvement and my ability to enjoy being in the company of others to enjoy like occasions and to enjoy my work and do while at my work [noise]\nOne of the psychological studies into scarcity invent with a relatively new the ideas are actually ancient\nKeep difficult things in one part of your life from contaminating everything else be present\nThe you have a big deadline tomorrow for something that you go home and you're spending the evening with your kids [noise]\nAnd in that moment you're not present focused at all what you're focused on is that deadline\nYou you may go two minutes where you didn't hear what your kids were saying to you\nBecause your mind keeps going through this other than\nTunnel vision is not in itself a good thing or a bad thing\nShutting distractions can be helpful at times the question is do you know when you're inside the tunnel\nTo me that's exactly the heart of managing scarcity it's recognizing when you try to do something related to your scarcity where\nYou really want to use that instinct and when you made a conscious decision to do something else where what you really need to do is to not have it in food on that something else your home you with your kids you chose to be a parent's for that three hour period you really don't want to scare seated then\nOf course it's easy to say bill free time at your schedule state president with your family take a vacation these strategies presume you have choices\nYou can't say I've had it with being lonely I'm going to take a vacation for being lonely\nNo choice and to me loneliness in poverty\nOr the forms of scarcity to heal the biggest because well all these forces are put at play there's no relief though there's no skate back into some\nOther and send to one policymakers to design solutions that recognize how scarcity creates traps from which many people may not be able to extricate themselves and they want the rest of us just stopped preaching to those in poverty\nIf you look at problems of poverty we often confounded little bits that comes to help the poor will be a ... mixture of the show up in time but they do the right things\nIt from the perspective you we've taken would scarcity in some sense if I'm very busy juggling a very complicated life insisting that I show up at the office of faith and not fatal five\nJust not during the ... you could have just hard to manage um you know it's just the transportation reliable method is not really a babysitter and wouldn't make mistakes that it's not clear educating me in quotes about ... helped me at all just makes life all the more complicated\nWhen people in poverty fail or make mistakes the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots\nThere was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes which is bad pilots center says a big reason add travelers become safer in recent decades is that there's been a shift in thinking about such mistakes designers have made cockpits fault tolerant\nRather than trying to find perfect pilots cockpits and now designed to account for human era the goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes\nIt's ironic that when we design cockpits entire mantra fault tolerance seems so intuitive\nBut when you design social policies nobody's out there talking about let's make the salt tolerant I mean you know what people have a lot on their mind or band with tax they're going to make mistakes let's make sure this program as robust when they do make that mistake it's just not the way we think if I offer training program I don't sit there and say\nUh let me make sure you know it's going to happen [noise] this is for low income individuals surely they're going to miss a few days\nBecause you know it's hard to get get to class sometimes or other things are on their mind\nSo let me designed this curriculum so that it's in attendance tolerant so even if somebody must have three days in the world to be able to come on the fourth day instilled feel caught up in fact are a a a training critical is often quite the opposite if you missed three days in a row it's an invitation to miss the fourth day you're not going to get anything\nBrandi drew eventually turned her life for doubt she found a low income assistance program that offered her how she walked with a financial counselor who gave her strategies for budgeting our money and keeping track of long term priorities\nActually have a calendar now that I write down everything to make campaign things on the correct day in time\nIt's taken time and little steps but brandy\nIs no longer in the scarcity tunnel she's been working for a few years now actually has savings\nI Know that if anything happens God Forbid if I lose this job I Know that I can survive for at least six months if I have to look for another\nNo down in center themselves say that they are constantly trying to keep the lessons of scarcity front and center in their own lives as a busy academic elders come up with a rule with an invitation to an event two months down the road comes along the U.S themselves whether he would attend the event\nIf it were tomorrow is the answer is no he declined the invitation because his life is not going to be any less hectic two months from now presenting bond\nWith sticks conscious effort most of us out into the are going to violate the rules will say yes to new commitments when we don't have the time or not a credit card when we can't afford it in those moments it's important to look up to notice we're inside of the tunnel\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity [noise] to access\nIt turns out that having too much\nCan have its own set of problems when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you sell it breeds a kind of suspicion why are you being nice to me or you just trying to give me give you something\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and
