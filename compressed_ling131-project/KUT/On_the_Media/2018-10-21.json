{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "So we're specifically writing this narrative within people in Hollywood to say that women people of color where people trans people disabled people and other other people are all suffering from the same problem which is that patriarchy and white supremacy have hold on storytelling and other people want their chance\nI wanted to talk about transparent you're very open in your book about your decision to cash to Jeffrey Tambor who is not a transgender woman I'm In the role of a more transparent can you talk a little bit about that decision because it received a lot of criticism at the time\nYeah well I was really ignorant about trans politics I guess first before I unpack everything that happened I I always want to say that Jeffrey Tambor his portrayal of Mara\nWas absolutely astonishing and beautiful and Jeffrey's a fantastic actor mhm but also I was making huge mistake around traps politics by having assessment and play a trans woman\nBecause for trans women they are being accused by people of quote unquote being men dressing up as women that's what makes chance when it's so vulnerable and public\nSo having even\nJeffrey Tambor dressing up as a trans woman\nMay have translated to people who work in the know as this is what trans women are men dressing up as women so not only was it a problem with casting it really was a very very very dangerous dangerous thing for trans women you'd make a different decision now in casting\nPeople asking that question I think time machine questions are really odd because I couldn't go back because the world has changed so much\nAnd when I was making transparent I myself really didn't understand my own parents ... yet\nAnd I still had so much of my parents' image in my mind of when she was presenting as assess mail that it didn't even occur to me to cast a trans woman so I think you know it is what it was and what it was was was the show was with Jeffrey in it\n[noise] ... I'm Jeffrey Tambor was accused by a former crewmember and a member of the cast of sexual harassment I'm with is location to suppress too yeah they were\nA lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about believing people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TDY family my own family my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you acknowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things you know that I wrote on posted as I was like saying what do we want right now and this moment I wrote you know unlock all and da\nAnd ... for not nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance at our show where some trans women and wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massaging anywhere I didn't immediately say to van and trace let's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said about about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was to her I was says I'm a vote trace and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways sacrifice themselves\nAnd in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one what's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while\n[noise] this is going to keep happening my friend's artist people we admire then to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this is a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone\nEspecially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial act\nUm and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men\nDeeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects their privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for ... for you\nOf course I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor as career over the protection of trace lives that's career and Ben Barnes career and I think that's what happens as as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him\nAnd I think there are a lot of straight white says men who have half positions of power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives is part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place they're paying first before everybody else's\nShe'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty the memoir is called she wants it thank you\nFor Mm\n\n\nWeekend edition is a production of NPR News which is solely responsible for its content to find out more about the books and authors you hear on NPR programs and go to NPR dot org slash book there you'll find them author interviews NPR's best seller lists and\nFind out what our staff is reading [noise]\n\nThis is weekend edition from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the wall is foundation fostering improvements in learning and enrichment for disadvantaged children and the vitality of yards for everyone ideas that Wallace Foundation dot org ... from Amazon Prime video with\nThe Romanoff is a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring jumps lottery amend a peaceful rise or and Kathryn ... on\nA new episode every Friday on prime video and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nWe thank you very much for joining us on the Sunday Morning for weekend edition Sunday from NPR this is Austin's NPR station get you to you and K.

on as we see it in the west and the government how to negotiate that so many territory but it seems like the media has been a willing partner and\nYou know we have a kind of binary approach to viewing Saudi Arabia I Do think that it tends to be problematic not just on the one sided which of course they're presented constantly as reformers [noise] but then there's also the sort of very stereotypical views as these barbaric civilizations and the kind of oriental is\nLens through which the middle east is often viewed\nLends itself to a kind of a carrot and stick approach so and the one hand\nYou paint them in a very kind of building a role in that you give them the opportunity to reform to become an light in the best example of that I Would say is is really looking just at this last year with the Saudi crown prince this new generation of Saudi leads is internalized these narratives over the course of many decades and actually come to play into them\nBy essentially trying to placate certain liberal sensibility things like credit to women the right to drive or reopening movie theaters\nKnowing that these kinds of things could be used as cover for things like a massive consolidation of power in a massively reckless and violent foreign policy that of course is because the next brutality taken out on the people have you on\nThis is sort of par for the course in terms of the way that everyone bought into the first line while kind of ignoring second\nThomas Friedman and the New York times called crown prince Mohammed bin Salman more McKenzie than one hobby\nYeah I mean you know that's one of those classic wind that really jumps out there's a specific kind of way in which we conceive of how the crown prince has kind of allied himself with particular policy leads and consulting elites and the ways in which he tailor made this message and I think you saw that a lot on the tour that he just\nTook within the u._s. just over the last few months\nCrown prince of Saudi Arabia stopped traffic and turned heads on his trip to Seattle to topple telecom valleys Harris media executives Rupert\nMurdoch bought by gr and Oprah to this as Saudi Arabia dramatically opens up to foreign entertainment in the kingdom going from zero to big bucks let's talk\nAbout their PR effort that really good at this aren't they\nLet me one of the things that really struck me as an every single interview that NBS state including our belief sixty minutes interview I mean he really had this owned line about\nSaudi extremism and support for sort of the most militant kind of heavy ideologies that somehow pointed the finger back at Iran and this idea that Nineteen Seventy nine signaled this turning point\nAbout says after Nineteen Seventy nine we were victims I mean especially my generation suffer from this a great deal\nAnd he said it in every single interview that he did and it was echoed by every single journalist who covered him while he was in the country and\nAs a result she can be the white Knight writing in cleansing Saudi society of its extremist tendencies while at the same time he's actually engaged in far more war crimes that probably the several Saudi king going back generations\nThe show she case and a lot of ways in some sort of exception the troops that rule in ways that there has been I Would say very laudable reaction on the part of the U.S media editing any particular the newspapers that have been the most heavily implicated in that kind of\nGleaming coverage of Saudi Arabia going back many years\nYou think there's been a move towards mayor culpa\nWell [noise] I wouldn't go that far I think that this case in particular at a little closer to home because ... she represented someone who would sort of a endeared himself I think to that same kind of elite you made a lot of friends in Washington that of course was self a columnist for the Washington Post so\nAs a result I think we see the outrage that we don't normally see on the part of the crash especially when it comes to the fact that these kinds of incidents have been occurring with some regular\nAnybody who was either a part of a social movement religious preachers feminist movement student youth groups anybody who had anything to say on line on social media was basically rounded up\nSometimes people who didn't really say anything at all because just for the lack of explicit support for the regime that was enough to see them hauled off the president\nDid you see a rule the highlights recent article in the Financial Times yeah she was talking about how\nWestern journalists loves to see every new leader in the region as a reformer first before proven otherwise what do you think about that pattern while I mean I I think\nThe speaking about them as reformers is really just code for will they be reliable allies who will protect and preserve hundred US interests in the region and that's really the only measure\nBut if you live up to these kind of expectations you can expect to be shower with more praised with or promises of aid and support and you know glowing media coverage the article mentioned a lot of examples including us started ... others\nOf Congress on both parties have said they believe he's a reformer\nThe ... second son was once regarded as the man who would bring Libya the closest to the west\nOr one that comes to mind if Saddam Hussein that's not mentioned that I think it's interesting to see how his transformation occurred as someone who was a modernized or someone who was seen as a reliable ally\nSpecifically during the year war with Iran in the Nineteen eighties and then of course the moment that he breaks with the U.S and decides to launch his own aggressive foreign policy specifically with his invasion of Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety all of a sudden it becomes a sort of brutal dictator all of a sudden people were big attention to human rights abuses as though they didn't exist in the Nineteen eighties\nDoes NBS no longer get upon\nThe narrative begins to shift again and all of a sudden you know somehow this all got swept under the rug and there's opportunity to reinvent himself yet again as this reform or perhaps even entering\nReformer in this case but I think that at that point yet we will have failed but if there's going to be a kind of a continued critical engagement to the point where it's going to be really difficult for him to ever be able to sort of entertain the same kinds of you know business elites coming to visit or policy makers or\nGetting the kind of go off the coverage that he's received up to this point that may signal a massive shift\nAnd will you be watching the New York times or Thomas Friedman column [noise] [laughter]\nWell that's that's a really easy target I think just given sort of a brazen there but I think that this is a phenomenon that exists the arm\nIt's a much wider problem obviously we see it across news networks and she'd across\nOther

S. popular imagination about how everybody can claim to be native to have an ancestor in the family without actually having lived relations with native people it just it it I don't know something in that video crystallized for me\nThe deep\nPower imbalance that exists between indigenous people and everybody else our voices just don't matter our definitions of who we are just don't matter because or images are so much more important to non native\nPeople as they romanticize the this American past so who we are as people in and of ourselves as not important we are only tokens that help most Americans feel comfortable in the lands um that's been stolen I I don't know how to put more specifically than that\nRebecca Nagl wrote last year and think progress she said that as contemporary Native Americans ... warns of the world leader very little space for us to exist which when you understand the history of the United states makes perfect sense\nYes Rebecca NATO put it perfectly [laughter] yes I agree with Dr\n... thank you very much thank you for having me on Dr Kim tall there is a professor of native studies at the University of Alberta DNA tests will never confirmed membership in the Native American community\nBut African Americans having use for such biological markers indeed for\nMany black people DNA testing is just the latest ... in a long standing search for origin that took off during the black power era and was exemplified by the Nineteen Seventy seven TV miniseries roots\nMark TV [noise]\nThe true story Alex Haley uncovered in his twelve years search across the southern generations of as a\nSociologist Alondra Nelson says that for the many African Americans that have been stripped of their ancestral languages their culture and knowledge of their roots DNA tests while in perfect can be a solace and died\nIf you know nothing at all the ability to even be able to get a genetic in France is filling in a lot of information you know for example one of the groups that I encounter group of people who call themselves DNA Sierra Leone ends and for them to be able to have a religious ceremony\nAll of us are out of a ceremony of remembrance about their ancestors who were trafficked and loss during the slave trade is a kind of reconciliation even as theirs and appreciation that the technology doesn't fully fill\nIn all of the gaps and you trace the origins of DNA testing for reconciliation purposes\nBack to Argentina after the government disappeared thousands of people during the dirty war in the seventies and the eighties when they took the children of people who were disappeared and place them with other families\nDNA was used to prove blood relationships\nThat very young medical geneticists Mary Claire King who would become a quite renowned for her research on the RCA breast cancer gene\nGoes to work with these grandmothers in Argentina the use of it by African Americans that I trace that begins with the advent of the direct to consumer ancestry testing industry in the United states which emerges in the early aughts\nIs proceeded by a couple of decades of other uses of genetics to answer questions about the past\nAmong them at the African burial ground and lower Manhattan back in the nineties\nYes here you have an African American geneticists named ... and a business woman named Janet page\nStarting this company in two thousand three that's based on scientific research that Rick ... does as a member of the African burial ground research project and what were they looking for there was an attempt to put up a federal building that turned out that it was in fact\nA burial ground and so what starts as a construction site become soon after an excavation site\nAt the time the largest known burial ground that offers us any information about\nAnd slaves Africans from colonial era and New York ... hadn't even finish his PHD in genetics could use these new genetic techniques to make some inferences about we're on the African continent these buried folks might have held from\nThat process and that question comes to enemy the African ancestry company that he starts in two thousand three\nThe African ancestry company is is that kind of like twenty three and me it was like\nTwenty three and me although it proceeds twenty three and me by about five years old though one of the first pioneering companies was a black owned genetic ancestry testing company but still in business today\nI did not know that one of the first significant companies to do this was designed to help African Americans discover what their actual roots were been designed\nBy people who are very well versed in the history of scientific racism\nWho could say we understand the limits of the technology we understand what the history of eugenics and genetics has meant in the world but we are trying to use it in a way that we hope can offer some new information to communities that would otherwise not have it\nOne of the points that's most important to you is that it adds complexity to a kind of flatten notion of race\nSlavery was a caste system and nobody seemed to care where they came from or what their cultural background was and this returns that information to people\nGenetic ancestry testing becomes a place to turn to offer those possibilities for new ways of thinking about oneself\nBut it's in the context of technologies that are making kind of inferences and are using certainly in the early days of the market a few genetic markers and saying that these few genetic markers or Poland or our Evo or are in Mauritania\nAnd that's a kind of reduction of all of who humans are too few markers even as the sort of intention here is to give fullness inhumanity the cost of doing that is too and view very abstract and technical things with a sense of culture and place\n[noise] ... you chronicled the story of and I'm going to messes up ... or ...\n... a farmer pale men right she was an activist to organize the class action suit by descendants of slaves in two thousand two but she couldn't prove standing there was no way that she could show that she was a direct descendant\nOf the people whose and slave meant these companies profited from\nShe goes to the African ancestry company and two thousand four so the markets about two and a half years old and the United states\nAnd purchases genetic ancestry test and offers them as a sort of response to the critique that they didn't need the standing doctrine but these are technologies that come out of human population genetics and so they're not\nTechnologies that can really go to the level of the individual\nWhy don't we use blood tests to prove paternity\nSo if we go back to the Argentina case you had a close relative a grandparent grandmother grandfather to whom one could compare oneself and\nUnfortunately given the long legacy of slavery and our inability to do with some of the reconciliation that many are still seeking many generations have passed ...\nIdentity is fundamentally a cultural issue a political issue with social issue\nThe reaction to Elizabeth Warren's announcement that she has Native American ancestry I think is a perfect example of this right identity is something that we say about ourselves but it's also something that other say about us\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to\nBe able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race has cast mhm it's also the case that particularly in a place like the United states and twenty Eighteen that's deeply polarized and becoming\nDeeply racialized no one is making fine distinctions and the workplace\nAnd the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identity is furious as they are entitled people to or don't entitle people too in the world\nAlondra thank you very much it's a
