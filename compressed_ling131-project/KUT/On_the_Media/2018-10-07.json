I'm Bill Harlow thanks very much for listening have a great Sunday\n\n\nSaid Russia [laughter] I'm not thinking of that sort of area I Know you're not taking new never did\nThe president randomly demeans a female reporter at a press conference from WNYC in New York this is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone this week we heard that men believe they are the victims and they're not going to take it anymore\nWe are in a moment where the status quo is trying\nHardest too high for correct by saying out loud things than it used to paper over with a socially acceptable thing you're chivalry\nAlso back in Nineteen Ninety two big celebration with plans to mark the five hundred anniversary of Christopher Columbus his arrival in the Americas\nAmerican indian activists in American indian people just said enough with this Columbus ... enough with this happy indigenous people's day to\n\nWas truly surprising to me at this moment is that we're seeing a group that spent years laughing at the very idea of anything like quote rape culture suddenly not just admitting that it exists but arguing that it should male malfeasance is an unstoppable cocktail of culture and biology\nAnd the subtext stripped of all the pretense\nIs that the victims don't actually matter just by coincidence says all of this is happening I kept stumbling across news stories that almost laughable you can frame ... overblown this panic about men suddenly being persecuted really is because these are cases where men were found guilty in a court of law\nOf sexual assault and received no jail time anyway [laughter] so in Anchorage Justin Schneider was indicted by a grand jury last month on for a felony charges and he was accused of offering a woman or ride strangling her until she was unconscious and masturbating on her\nThat he got no jail time not or did not apologize for his actions but thanks the judge for accepting the deal\nWould you want to I'm a group going on to the new year to really work on one\nPerson from Hungary [noise]\nAnd the district attorney for the case in fact called him losing his job punishment enough he called that a life sentence wow yeah\nYou observed that a majority of the G O P has said that even if Kavanaugh is guilty of doing what he did it isn't disqualifying you think that shows real contempt for women's safety\nAnd that it gives the lie to the whole notion of Courtland us and especially chivalry what do you mean by that\nI mean that chivalry is protection racket and always has been [laughter]\nA words you give us your field tea you allow us to limit your ambitions and control your speech and behavior and you won't get hurt\nYou won't get hurt and maybe it'll be financially supported\nBut if you don't you will be punished that's the flip side of that and I think that that has been exposed you see what happens to people who step out of line you see how Dr Ford has been treated you see how the other women who have spoken up are treated by the GOP whether it's Dianne Feinstein whether it's\nCentered include which are whether it's silly of me that she was shocked\nThat are ... the tortoise show I'm not thinking that that's over there I Know you can do\nAnd it's we just we can Mr President we are in a moment where the status quo is trying its hardest to hyper correct by saying out loud the things that it used to paper over with a socially acceptable venue of chivalry when you have a class of people\nWho had things are arranged such that\nIn any situation that involves a man and a woman alone the woman absorbs one hundred percent of the risk to her physical safety and to her reputation\nAnd he shoulders none of course they're going to be extremely upset\nFerment you have to shoulder any amount of risk under those circumstances becomes intolerable there just dresses real one of the things that really struck me during the hearing was how angry circulated in that room and how the one person not permitted to express any was Christine Blasey Ford\nThe theatrics that the GOP demonstrated in the second half of that hearing involved a lot of grabbing the anger ball so to speak and just out screaming you know what it reminded\nMe of in basketball there's this thing that players do sometimes called flopping their touched by another player and then they fall hard on the floor hoping that the ...\n\nThat's so good yeah that is a strategic performance that cannot be honored and I think that the me too movement has unleashed a lot of\nAnger that has never been permitted to be expressed or felt\nTell my daughter\nAnd I think that that is a pretty potent tool and honestly I think it's actually very healthy for people who has been repressing and bottling up their anger into a socially acceptable performance for as long as they has been feeling it\nYeah look his family express it\nSo you're talking about democratic women or Lindsey Graham\nI'm Talking about democratic women I think in the grand has been expressing just sign [laughter] think he's okay\nBut when I see that I managed very angry it's a very instinctive reaction and a little bit afraid and I think to myself oh well he must be right in some way I should cheat a little bit and give glad that I find myself no longer being very impressed by I think I'm not alone the intimidating function that male anger you sit there and I think is wearing fan [noise]\nThank you very much for having me literally Lewis thorough is a staff writer for slate\n\nComing up the best seller dairy my heart of the wounded knee\nDocuments the mind

South Dakota in Eighteen Ninety\nTrier says frontier soldiers field for a lot of innocent because they were ... by the ghost dance a religion based on the vision of the pie you spiritual leader named the Boca\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision he basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can't cheat or Steeler drink\nIf we do all these things well then we will be reunited with her loved ones that our ancestors in the after world give us almost Protestant and its\nIts insistence on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers in the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe meaning all the white\nPeople meaning the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted outspent suit as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them the next day they moved to disarm them\nBecause that did have an impact it didn't let some substantial legislation\nBut yeah there was an amazing legislation finally passed the Nineteen seventies that improved American indian education I remember going to school this was in the seventies and eighties but\nI cannot have an American Indian teacher until graduate school by the time my younger brother and sister who're eight years younger went to school they had native teachers they had teachers who are like them and this meant a great deal to them\nAnd this was due to the Indian Education Act of Nineteen Seventy two\nA lot to do with that and in Nineteen Seventy eight I Believe Carter signed into law the American Indian religious freedom act mhm until Nineteen Seventy eight it was illegal for Native American people to practice their religion we weren't being prosecuted by the government if we practice religions in the Nineteen seventies but for Carter to finally grant\nNative American people religious freedom had an incredible effect no longer if you were a traditional native person where you suspect were you dismissed out of hand or or pushed to the to the side\nSo yes a lot of good things happen in the seventies and many of those good things happened because of bringing our case onto people's television sets\nWe're speaking ahead of indigenous people stay October eighth the movement to change the name of the holiday really began in the early nineties\nRights so Nineteen and she was the five hundredth anniversary of Columbus his arrival in the new world Nineteen and she was also the cresting of multi cultural wave especially in academia\nPeople an African American studies of people you know Latino people I'm Asian American people were saying no no no no no in fact the progressive human thinking in the evolution of human civilizations has never been the simply the progress of white people\nAnd people were not content to simply celebrate Columbus people were much more interested in interrogating the legacy of colonialism which was still being felt in populations around North America and certainly Native Americans were protesting that very special Columbus Day\nBut Latinos were protesting that African Americans were protesting that we all were finding common cause as we look back\nAt five hundred years of colonialism and what it had done to us and how it had made the country\nAnd so when the Spanish government decided in conjunction with the American government that they were going to send some replicas of the Nina pinto in Santa Maria across the ocean that around the United states it's pretty tone deaf on the part of the Spanish government is yeah you don't mind me saying like live in these ships\nTo the places where they introduced slavery to native populations in the modern populations descended from the slaves that were owned by\nAnd ... and his brother for instance they were rebuffed it just fizzles\nIn the meantime our government was planning a\n... to take off Nineteen Ninety two yeah with its own replicas of the three boats sailing under the Golden Gate bridge but corporate sponsors retreated right the jubilee never happen\nExactly because American indian activists in American indian people just said enough with this Columbus crap we're not going to sit by and let you do this\nAnd by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had generations of native people complaining high school and going to college and serving in the army and serving in World War one and World War two in Korea and Vietnam by Nineteen Ninety two we'd had native veterans coming back from the first Gulf War for that matter and not with this\nSo now the state of Alaska and\nHawaii Oregon South Dakota and Vermont don't recognize Columbus Day there\nAre cities Austin, Texas Salt Lake city Los Angeles uh Minneapolis Seattle they celebrate indigenous people's day has a ways to go but we've come a long ways so why don't we jump ahead the Standing Rock okay you take issue with a popular narrative\nThat was used by the former chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the author of a New York times op ed\nWho had the treatment of Indian protesters\nAnd the Bundy bothers the protesters who sees the my lord National Wildlife refuge in Oregon he wrote on the same day that the armed Malory militants were acquitted I watched as riot police with military grade weapons rounded up hundreds of peaceful water protectors in North Dakota\nProtesting an oil pipeline the juxtaposition of these two events one system of justice for self styled white cowboys and another for Indians was stunning\nI don't buy this is a crucial difference that German Archambault was missing here the white supremacists wherever you might call them that at the allure refuge they're occupying federal land\nThe water protectors at Standing Rock were being arrested for trespassing on private land\nThe issue wasn't that why people are being treated differently than Indians I think to maintain that kind of us than Indian white cowboys and Indians discourse is to miss the larger point that the federal government privileges private property above all most everything else that's the problem\nBut weren't the protesters at Standing Rock trying to protect what would ultimately be damage to their own land well of course\nBut the problem was that Ninety percent of the pipeline was routed\nThrough private lands there were ways to rewrite it away from you you can meet with the pipeline and meet with the Army Corps of engineers as many tribes on the pipeline's route did and subsequently the pipeline was rerouted around those communities but Standing Rock missed meeting after meeting\nNegotiation of negotiation deadline up to a deadline until the government finally without their input approve the pipeline under the lake and very close to sending Iraq\nWhat you're saying is that this us versus them mentality was huge missed opportunity\nOriginal sin is that the government broke it's treaty obligations and promises to the Standing Rock and other Lakota tribes which resulted in opening up Lakota land to private non native ownership that's what allowed the pipeline to go through because our government will bend over backwards for private enterprise to me this is a story\nOf local communities against capitalism not cowboys versus Indians\nBut I'm Sorry but we already know that story where you know what happens to Indian for sort of we're feeling our own faith let's face it you know part of the problem is an Iraq was that the government didn't show up for meetings\nYou know I think it's really important that are activists with their bodies on the line but I think it's also important that our elected travel official she put their bodies and chairs and short for meetings don't get me wrong setting rock was amazing and important and powerful what was amazing about that protest\nWas that they issued big your heads and I would say chauvinist sexist violent leadership like we saw in past iterations of Indian activism at would've neat\nWe had a collection of the diaspora that was coming to the defense of Standing Rock it was powerful and important and that the legacy of that protest will live on\nImmediately after the protests was over at Standing Rock\nThe question of pipelines came up on my reservation my reservation council had previously approved pipelines through the reservation after standing right there is no way they could possibly hope to be reelected if they approved more pipeline leases so it had an immediate effect around the country\nAnd this was the result of healthy positive kind of activism the likes of which we had not seen\nBefore so what is the narratives you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds\nI Want it once and for all destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world enter a serpent in fourteen Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] did you have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise]\nIn my mind it's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much\nThank you so much I'm really\nSpeaking out to be on the show David Dreier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation and
