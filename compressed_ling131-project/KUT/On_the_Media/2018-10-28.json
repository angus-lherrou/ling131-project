time the press seems less like an institution than in amalgamation of our own quirks by any a witness to this is Claire Malone of five thirty eight reporters over both the media coverage and the polls themselves\nI asked her apart from seeing all human events through an electoral prism what other Trump suits noticed this time around\nI think that there have been certain states that perhaps have been over covered in this election or maybe the candidates odds have been amplified beyond what what we would sort of give them from a I guess a statistical look\nPolitical rights Texas has fatal mania had choir says he could be the next Obama Vanity Fair calls him Kennedy\nAsk it's obviously an interesting election because he has as a Democrat garnered a lot of enthusiasm in a deeply red state and for people looking at the demographics of that state and looking to see people aging into voting whose parents were immigrants perhaps and thinking of the Latino population that state\nSo it's it's interesting for Democrats to see a work doing well but honestly I mean somewhere like Tennessee which is another\nDeeply red state so rather than who is running as a Democrat there is the former governor of the state\nAnd I would say that the Democrats chances and that's they're much better than they are in Texas so we have a little bit of a natural inclination towards a sexy headlined a telegenic candidate like O'Rourke\nI did a piece on him\nA couple of weeks ago and you know\nThey might lead I talked about the number of times he's been compared to a Kennedy people like assigning stories like that but then you also have to say well let's talk to people about the actual demographics have access and whether or not he has his good of a chance as people might be getting the impression that he does\nIn this the me too you're one of the earliest narratives attached to the midterms was the year of the woman we're doing a wonderful kind of documentary story about what's now being called the year of the women it's\nBeing called a seismic shift a record number of women running for elected office there are a total\nOf one two three four five six democratic women in the ...\nThe last time that narrative was so pronounced was in Nineteen Ninety two when in fact the number of women in the house increased by double digits is is the year of the women plural for Democrats so what is in fact taking place according to your numbers in twenty two\nSo there are two hundred and thirty eight women running\nIn total a hundred and eighty six Democrats and fifty two Republicans\nBasically we determined if every woman who's currently leading into districts were to end up winning there'll be a hundred women in the house and twenty four in the Senate and that is an increase from the current count which is a hundred and seven total limit in Congress but I think we also have to know that some of those women will lose their races and so the percentage of women\nHolding seats in Congress might actually not change all that much on the other hand a lot of these women who were running in primaries in particular because of this anti Trump sentiment that was sleeping in the country were first time candidates right\nAnd what we do know is that the more comfortable that people get within the political system maybe the more likely they are to do better the next time so while they might have lost his primary they might have a better grasp of local donors in their district\nWho to go to and hire the next time they run a campaign so while the percentage of women in Congress may or may not shift in twenty Eighteen it could have effects it in the next couple of election cycles but I think that there's a difference between winning running and women actually winning the seat and it being a quote unquote year if the woman\nA handful special Electra instead of taking place over the last year has been characterized as\nA referendum on Trump on the fact that he doesn't represent most Americans that his values don't line up with most Americans\nHow do you see the numbers on the Trump question so far\nIn quite a few races candidates are leaning in and even if they don't say Trump's name and their ads their ads are kind of ... I got a big drug [noise]\nJust in case I moved around a criminal illegals and take them home to sell\nMy ... build the wall or we're going to deport illegal\nFrom Jim if you aren't politically incorrect conservative ...\nAsked me I think the reasons why some of these Republican candidates or perhaps trying to keep an arm's length distance from Trump is because there are certain traditional constituencies that are turned off by the president said college educated white women who might be a sort of potable entity for Democrats so\nThe thing that people should keep in mind is is mid term elections even if the president isn't coming up and every single commercial that you see on TV that's a political ad\nVoters are inherently thinking about what\nIs going on in the White House in every election not just to Trump's election and you react to it and you say oh I like this guy and I like his party or I don't like this guy and I don't like his party and that might influence\n... elephant in the room one might say yes here's a son\nThis one might say this November election is more important than any mid term in our lifetime the states they couldn't\nBe every single election is portrayed as the most important election of all time uh I Will say for the twenty eighth term Alex's it really is the most important election of all five\nSo your numbers suggest a turnout that reflects the most important election of our electrons you're\nSeeing pretty enthusiastic numbers from people saying like yes I'm very pumped to vote pumps to turn out\nAnd I think particularly on the Democratic side in certain races they're hoping that democratic turnout what kind of push them over the edge in states that are either purple or are red tilting that voted for Trump and the election so turnout is certainly an important factor\nIn any election but in mid term elections in particular because they are typically lower turnout election and so these interesting pre election surveys are we seeing people be enthusiastic makes us think oh this might actually be on both sides\nOf the aisle pretty engaged mid term election\nThe early voting numbers are way\nOff color and counting today is number fit into twenty sixteen presidential election and shattered that turn out to look for the last midterm election\nIn North Carolina the first five days more cash than a twenty sixteen same thing in Minnesota the secretary of state there than the level of participation is close off the charts\nAnd this has been widely interpreted as suggesting that there is a you know ongoing insurgency among Democrats is there any evidence that the uptick in early voting is good news for democratic candidates\nVery short answer is no early voting numbers are something that\nPartisans and political operatives in campaigns really like to fight in the weeks coming up to the election as look at this groundswell of support that we're seeing but ultimately I they don't tell us much about who is going to be the ultimate whenever I watch\nKnow in previous elections there's always been so much focus on October surprises and this election just in the last week or so has offered three such October surprises the plummeting stock market\nThe bombs being sent to a number of Democrats and the media and other critics of the president and the caravan Central American caravan working its way up through Mexico to the border or your numbers showing\nThat these episodes are having an effect on the electric well\nWe don't have any numbers on the effect that these events have at all so we can't say what I Would say was probably the October surprise was the Kavanaugh hearing\nThat is something that left people with lingering strong feelings\nYou know I'm not quite sure what's going to happen with these bombing attempts over the next couple of weeks I'm not sure what's going to happen with the caravan those two stories are are really moving ones and and we don't have any real data yet to point and say I guess this has had an effect you know perhaps who will\nYou know the week before the election Trump is certainly trying to use the caravan to Republican advantage although that's the sort of double edged sword for him because\nYou might make an already in the ... democratic\nElectorate more enthusiastic pie guess baiting them on that issue and Democrats we now have gotten much more liberal on immigration so I guess the short answer is we just don't know how the electorate is reacting to those things\nSo I I guess one final question does any of this matter or there's still many mine's not made up and of those mine's not made up or they're going to go to the polls in the first place do we have any idea of what would happen if the election we are today\n[noise] well I Would say even in the incredibly partisan year that is twenty Eighteen yes there are still many people whose minds are not made up there are moderate voters who are perhaps this pleased with\nThe current administration and who Democrats and Republicans have to make place for either by saying give\nThe middle finger to the White House or coming home you know that the Republican Party is where your true is lie\nClaire thank you very much of course thanks for having me Claire Malone is a senior political writer for five thirty\nNot an invasion and [noise]\nThe media is supported by

graduate center professor John ... is what's known as the facilitated function of passports\nBut we're more commonly think of their restrictive function how'd they say where you can go and where you can't according to ... this restrictive function has its roots in serfdom and slavery\nSlave for example in the United states to forty to sixty five\nWould have had to pass in order to go abroad\nOtherwise he would be regarded as a potential runaway slave and captured and returned to his or her owner\nWe experience in the nineteenth century a kind of transformation because those forms of labor control were more or less lemonade so there was a so called exit revolution and people were increasingly allowed to move around in that helped to facilitate a huge migration to the America is not just in the United states but also to\nLatin America and particularly to Argentina\nSo at the heart of it I was kind of surprised to learn is economic security labor security but I was also kind of surprised to realize that the restriction on external travel by states is a relatively new development Ben Franklin didn't need a passport to be the toaster Paris he just showed up\nWhat changed in the nineteenth century to make government issued documents Nasser\nThis exit revolution took place and the idea of nationalism increasingly cold the idea was the states were peculiar possession of particular groups of people called nations the idea is that a certain group of people as a right to control the state\nAnd often that was construed an ethnic terms and so increasingly there was a kind of\nConcern about whether these other people over here should be allowed to come into our domains and that became a stronger concern as ordinary people were given the vote as more and more people have access to the ballot box it matters kind of who they are and whether they are people that we can\nCount on or they people who might Paris ill will so increasingly concerned outside of wartime became you know gets it where's hill mid nineteenth century it had primarily been a question from got out\nNow the consolidation of nation states in the ... century you described and the documentation of citizenship that came with that has created a collateral damage in the form of state listen this is a big problem throughout the world now moving\nTen million people did not have the country they need to leave me alone and then as the state ... from\nThe un more to the United Arab Emirates to Palestine but it isn't new tell me about not just stateless this passport Les Mis\n[noise] off in these kinds of problems arise when\nThere's major political upheaval so World War one is a key moment in the sense that there's the collapse of these European land empires the Russian Empire under the pressure of the Bolshevik Revolution the Ottoman Empire and the Austria Hungarian empire and all of a sudden all these people are kind of set adrift\nAnd they don't necessarily have the documents that they now need in order to enter some other state in those days there was the league of nations that basically decided to give the authority to a man named free just announced it and it was a Norwegian explorer and humanitarian\nHe was named to the league of nations high commissioner for Russian refugees\nAnd because this was such a widespread problem\nHe was given the authority to issue a document in his own name was called demands and passport\nSo that people will have the kind of documents that they need and subsequently the un has done the same kind of thing issued papers to people in need them\nIt's clearly been recognized especially since World War one that state listen this is\nA condition of considerable vulnerability and if you lack the documents you need a corresponding to said listen this that makes your situation that much more difficult\nIt's been an issue in the United states at the U.S Mexico border\nAnd immigration time I hit a sense department reportedly or red bumps passports\nFrom some Americans living along the southern border I Can't think I have\nI think isn't worth it gets very\nRecent cases that were reported by the Washington Post to have to do with people about whom there was some doubt that they were actually born in the United states and that there were falsified occasions of\nVerse documents by mid wives who were involved in the birth of those people I mean the basic underlying issues are these people citizens that is where they really born on the territory of the United states which you know in our law accords them citizenship\nWhatever the circumstances were of false vacation of papers by midwives or not\nSuddenly these people have no access to a passport they haven't got a Mexican passport and therefore are they even though they were most likely born within our borders some sort of undefined to other\n[noise] this is why in a way I got interested in this whole phenomenon of passports were not born with our citizenship stamp Bill Maher for it it can only really be made effect is with these kinds of documents so if they can't get access to documents they are indeed a difficult legal limbo\nI mean the United states has also particularly in mid twentieth century denied passports to people on political ground I mean very frequently denied passports to people who were members of the Communist Party thought to be connected to the Communist Party et cetera et cetera\nNow it's utterly un surprising that the passport has become apart from the means of documentation proof of origin and everything else a commodity\nIt's a hot ticket for a variety of reasons including as it turns out countries themselves that want to deal with the population that they don't want to make four members of the society\nSelling of citizenship is something that's been taking off certain countries in the Mediterranean and Cyprus in Malta and other countries [noise] they're taking in people who are basically buying citizenship who are making a contribution of some sort\nHow much it costs to go says ... hundred thousand dollars you have to come and live and Domenico no no you don't you don't even have to come to dominate the get the citizenship you pay the money from wherever you are sort of mail order citizenship sort of something like that\nSo as the passport becomes more of a commodity whether by individuals seeking certain benefits or by countries trying to offload responsibilities [noise]\nIs the passport as a mechanism at risk of being muddied by the free market for place there's long been a marketing passports\nHave parents that flight three Seventy assigning a life on the business of pasta pork fat Don good morning\nBecause some get you into lots of countries the American passport for example will get you into lots of countries without a visa and if you're from I don't know Nigeria Senegal your passport doesn't open as many visa free doors [noise]\nI think the market that we're talking about just really in a way a market for the underlying commodity which has citizenship citizenship has long been seen as a kind of sacred possession [noise]\nIt's about patriotism it's about devotion to your country it's about commitment to your fellow citizens and the idea that you can simply by one is seen accordingly as a kind of cheapening of that a sacred possession [noise]\nJohn thank you so
