{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Uh I I I I Would I Do I pull does not surprise me at all and I do believe as you say that this has been um the quiet when I mean it's the deadliest epidemic on our country's history and it's been percolating for Twenty years and yet it's only you can really say only in the last three years when I was writing my book dreamland\nI found it very little echo out there are very difficult time getting people interested in this uh who didn't have anything directly to do with it it was very much reminded me very much of the early days of the AIDS epidemic everyone wanted to hide it didn't want to confront it you know and and and I I think what's happened is that this is\nA been left to fester and ... all across this country now and a critical mass was reached a at a certain point so now it's become come out of the shadows but\nBut it's definitely a a problem that has not been recognized to the extent that it ought to consider how widespread how deadly\nUm uh it's been ... and ... I\nI Know that you feel that there's a a conversation about race that needs to happen when it comes to the way we view\nBoth the epidemic itself and the way drug abuse drug use the drug crisis is treated 'em both in the the I guess what the news media and also an entertainment we\nTalk about what you think about that yeah you know it's fascinating to me that this is a quote unquote sound epidemic that this is something which could have touched one of four people and uh and yet nevertheless not be blaring across the headlines with the kind of urgency that we have historically associated with\nA drug drug issues in say the inner city right the the crack epidemic of ah the eighties and so on so forth and I I think it actually it it it informs the tonality of how popular culture\nLooks at drugs I I think even in this episode we see a very strong empathy with Roseanne the abs Roseanne and her family this is really about talking about victims that people who've suffered an illness or in in vanished because of that or or been harmed because of that but when we seen\nOr other kinds of depictions of of addiction and of of drug use and abuse and dealerships\nAre among black communities and Hispanic comedians invariably about\nThe predatory influence the drug trade it's about the empowerment of drug dealers and how it you know that sort of invasive force harms not just black and Hispanic communities but of course adjacent white ones as well and that I think that's a little bit of a problem and how this talked about society\nBut say you know I wanted to ask you I Know you feel that this is the the quiet crisis as the as you have described it as part of me wonders whether it's because it's in part it started out as a rural crisis and the rural communities particularly the rural media for example\nIt's been has been hollowed out in the way that say local newspapers have been hollowed out and it is that is that part is it uh\nI Would say that's probably part of it I Would say to that that\nThe people involved you know I'm a member of the medium or working reporter for many years and and uh\nAnd if you and if if the people who are most affected actively don't want to talk about it if the obituaries that they write our purposely I'm a obfuscating or actual fabrications if you can't find those people are willing to talk\nIt is very difficult to to bring it to\nTo light and that is really what is happening all across the treasury starts and starts in Appalachia of the rust belt areas read now of course I think really it it is the biggest place you find it really is in the suburbs uh\nUm mostly among white people I'd say Ninety five percent Ninety plus percent um bobbing white people but I Would say that there's a lot of those folks\nAre just as some horror that they never imagined happening to their families on so uh they are very very unwilling to have been I Would say until until the last three years ... um or unwilling to talk about it when you don't have\nPeople who are most affected I Know it was a media a number of the media you don't have those people most able to tell the poignant story you ... it's very hard to get traction on it and also if you don't have\nThe kind of a I covered the crack epidemic that was my first job as a reporter uh and journalism many years ago when the child Stockton, California I could tell you the the you could not avoid the crack epidemic not because so much with the drug\nBut because of the ... the gang involvement the ... it's a drive by shootings of bullets so a crippling young young children um I mean ... that was it was impossible to avoid the crack epidemic in this one\nYou've seen overdoses sky rocket really as crime rates all across the country have really dropped precipitously and that's a that's also a new thing about this up\nAnd down the what your point about obituaries that's one of the other interesting stories this week it was a ... a an obituary about a young woman\nA ... you know it's such a cliche went viral but it did in part because her family was so explicit about what happened to her and it was very much\nA cry of heart you know to people saying you know educate yourself about this just before he got like you know we have about a minute left I'd like to ask you as our culture got what would you like to see what what do you like to see a as a ... in in terms of how\nWe address this issue for from a standpoint of our art because anytime you know a highly where the artistic any take something on people always accused him of glamorizing it or not really telling it on the other hand\nYou know so what would you like to see in the minute we have left\nI mean I I think it's really interesting that the two shows that we perhaps most associate with depictions of the drug trade\nOr over our our ... our generation a Breaking Bad is one and the wire is the other right and they're they're both shows that are incredible shows you know really great storytelling but the Breaking Bad almost has a sort of black and has black comic sort of ... to it or that\nBrings a different energy to the the thought about you know what that crisis represents\nThe path of human beings within it and not about an infrastructure system or a phenomenon or something right I I feel like a lot of times we don't see that that more human than individual perspective when you talk about you know drug issues in in communities I guess I'd like to see more of that more texture and more humanity\nThat shift Yankees uh CNN contributor and Wall
