{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "One of the reasons that I Try to speak up more forced civility because ah I think everyone should have influence including the president of the United states\nI think his tone has changed some I think some of his policies some of the things that have been an acted have been very good for the country but I think that's something that he specifically has to work on himself and I'm not afraid to say that\nI see what about you does that how does that sit with you what chat just said yeah [noise]\nWell [noise] um chat and I definitely have differences [laughter] I [laughter] and he um we talk about that quite a\nBit I Do not obviously support President Trump because\nAs I told you I'm I'm blue line progressive he's a I don't support his policies and I don't support what I see it says moral shortcomings um I don't know the chat with as far as to say that his incivility is a more shortcoming but I that's what how I feel about it so\nChad and I have many very civil discussions and we are very different when we come down on a very different sides on on\nA lot of what makes what helps you to do that is it because we both live here and you're going to see each other at the grocery store or is it now has you just like each other now or I've I've never run into him at the ground [laughter] way to do that because we\nBoth have a commitment to listening and when we sit down at the table with each other we come with an open mind really wanting to know what the other person thinks about\nAn issue and not trying to win the argument\nWe know that we're not going to change each other's opinions on anything and that's not our ...\nOur goal is really curiosity and open heart\nWhat advice does each of you have for people as we head into the home stretch of this election year\nMy first advise people would be a vote I think we need to come to realize that we started thinking of politics as\nWe'll lose our life in general as when lose that I have to beat you to to do well and actually where we have had the most progressive in civilization is when we learn to work together to everyone that I've said\nI Wonder if this work that you're doing here has special resonance in part because you are in Gettysburg which\nWas the scene of so much carnage earlier in our history and does that in a way of providing a counterpoint when you when you think about how many lost their lives here when this country was pulled apart and you're thinking well okay what what ... what do you think\nIt could be I grew up in the south and three of my great uncles fought in World War two of them died\nAnd I wonder when they came on not knowing whether the house is still the one came home not knowing the house was still standing I wondered if they looked at all that had happened\nAnd I remember that Lincoln had tried to offer an out to free the slaves buying them back one state at a time as we've done in many Latin American countries and they thought good grief where we nuts too\nI think that when when we think about the fact that we're meeting at\nThe church called the prince of peace which\nWas billed as a memorial of reconciliation between the north and south after the civil war I think that that says a lot about what our community stands for and work that we're trying to do\nChat does it have some special meaning for you that this work is taking place in Gettysburg I don't know where you were born and raised but doesn't provide a bit of residence for the work you're trying to come\nI often refer to myself as a rebel in Yankee territory and I say that you know tongue in cheek but uh it it certainly does make a difference and I said you know enough in talking was car endorsing I said if we can't talk about civility\nIn Gettysburg and work and\nAnd so um I happen to carry around\nOften times the civil war ... with me because that reminds me that\nIt wasn't just about political strategies it was about the bullets tour through the the the blood own and flash of fellow Americans and I'm also also not afraid to say and have confirmed us with many people that if we don't focus more on civility\nIn this day in time we're moving closer and closer toward another civil war if we're not careful\nSome of the headlines that we see across the country um and a lot of that depends on whether you focus on the positives of focus on the negatives but there are a lot of really bad stories across the country and that's why it's been encouraging to be\nA part of this group and to kind of resonates the message of civility because it is very very important especially in this day in time we have a chance to make a huge difference and if we don't take that opportunity than we really miss a\nWeek in\nLondon Chad collie Darcy Myers and car Thompson they are members of the group politics bats and civility we met up with them at prince of peace at this couple church in Gettysburg,
