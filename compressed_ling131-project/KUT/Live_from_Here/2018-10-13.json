I grew up mhm their feelings about being adopted\nEveryone expects you to feel grateful but it's more complicated than that everyone expects you to appreciate a good life that you have but you still feel complicated times you know not everything is gum drop stealing those\nThat's Caitlin how she reached out to us for this episode so I called her up\nTo interview her she lives in Eugene Oregon where she works for Holt International children's services which was founded in Nineteen fifty six and\nIt's the same agency that our parents used to adopt her almost Thirty years ago\nI Am a Korean adoptee and I work in the post adoption services department of the agency a it's a brand new position it's really kind of a new innovative direction that we're moving to include adoptees in programming more adoptees what\nHave you done specifically to\nYou know address these issues that you're talking about these issues that adoptees have brought up to us is feeling isolated feeling like they never had a real chance to get in touch with their birth culture or what have you been doing in your job to make\nThese adoptees feel like they're not isolated and they do have a connection to where they are from\nI think what I've actually seen sharing is that it's not I think that there is this assumption that the longing is four verse culture\nBut a lot of the times it's a longing for like deep connection to people that are like you so I think that that happens in a couple of ways to the work that um I've done\nOne is that we have adopted camps they started out as heritage camp so focused on Korean culture [noise] um but the realization happen that their adoptees from all over the world now in the U.S\nAnd so uh we do something called cabin talk so there's a topic of the day and I remember the first year that I was account where we're sitting around and there is domestic adoptees and there was adopted from China Korea\nEthiopia and we're all sitting around and everyone was just sharing their birth story\nAnd for us first stories are pretty traumatic stories you know for one girl it's like all I Know about my birthday is I was abandoned in front of a government building in China\nLike but extremely traumatic if that's your first known existence but what was amazing about sending circle is we went around the circle and everyone shares something pretty similar to that and so in hearing the stories\nThat adopting knows that she's not alone in that grief\nThese adoptees who I'm assuming they're all youth right that are going to just camp okay\nThat nine to Seventeen they are just so hungry for a place where there are other kids who are the exact situation that they can and that all almost in in of itself and that is their identity which I feel like we don't talk about yeah I agree\nI was actually at a conference it was like the Korean adoptees Chicago to this annual conference but that was the first time in twenty nine years that I've ever sat in a room of entirely Korean adult adoptees\nAnd it was extremely emotional and I just remember um\nDuring the closing ceremony one of the adult adoptees was on the stage and they made a remark that you know you guys are my homeland\nAnd I think that that really hit something deep inside of me because it is just like we kind of you or we can have that feeling like\nWe're not really creating for all intents and purposes and we're always recognized as a foreigner in the state so where is where is our homeland as adoptees\nAnd for a lot of adult adoptees I think they might not in each other [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's Caitlin how she's the adoptee program coordinator for Holt International children's services you can listen to the entire episode by downloading the codes which podcast on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts\nAnd for Saturday That's all things considered from NPR News I'm Shereen Marisol Meraji in from Michel Martin we're back tomorrow I'll\nHave a great night [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from love me and maker of go to meeting proud sponsor of how I built this entrepreneur summit taking place in San Francisco at the year ... center October sixteenth more about the summit at NPR dot org slash summit\nAnd from the NPR wind club where members receive NPR inspired wines like weekend edition cabernet and wait wait don't tell me more low available to adults Twenty one years or older learn more at NPR wind club dot org\nIn two thousand two I had just come back from Australia a living overseas for a couple of years catching a couple of friends and are going to feel\nIt was great that vinyl and a girlfriend not expecting to meet a lot of my life and and and he came by and out and\nWe hit it off and started going all the shows together and um [noise]\nAnd we are looking forward to going to feel again with our ten month old baby girl\nLuther King day off from\nNumber again and again your local often hoped for on NPR stations and K.
