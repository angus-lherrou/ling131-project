this week on only a game we asked the question what would have happened goalkeeper Brianna scary had gotten the credits\nInstead is brandy doesn't take that last kick I think women's soccer is still super popular but not anywhere near the way into the layout\nPlus we revisit a Nineteen Seventy five Wimbledon final and the bitter rivalry between Jimmy Connors and are the rash and stay tuned\n\nThat team played for the gold medal at the Nineteen Ninety six Olympics in Atlanta in front of tens of thousands of people in the stadium rooting for the home team and millions watching around the world this was the moment Brianna had been dreaming of since she was eight\nIt was magical you know millions of things had to occur in order for me to get in that exact spot at that exact time and I was there so I just knew we were going to win it was just a matter of time I just needed to focus in and do my job and uh I had complete faith that everybody else will do theirs and they did\nIn that moment Brianna and the other women who now in gold medals became heroes or the next generation of soccer players over the next year the nation watch thanks to television commercials as Brianna brandy mia Tiffany ... went to great lengths to stick together whether it was third fourth fifth and sixth wheeling it on a date\nHow tall you guys\nFor taking a team trip to the dentist

and that in Nineteen Ninety nine World Cup I thought finally an African American woman\nOn the world stage literally saving us\nFor me that was the image that should've been celebrated by a grateful nation but not for Brianna\nFor me is brandy doesn't take that last kick I think women soccer is still super popular but not anywhere near the way it ended up rolling out\nBecause which her image showed\nIs a literal transformation\nOf an opinion of women from one way to another way\nThat it was cool to have muscles and to be fit and to be strong\nSo in that regard for the greater good\nOf the game her image would go a lot further for a lot longer than mine would have gone\nBeyond it did receive a few endorsement deal she made it on that we need box and she sat on the couches and Jay Leno Rosie O'Donnell and Regis and Kathy late after ... more years as part of the U.S national team ... went on to play professionally\nAnd twenty ten as a member of the Washington ...\nThings changed I got hit in the side of my head on I'll make it a low ball safe\nFor the few weeks and months after that it just wasn't getting better was getting worse and it was a very tumultuous time for me I was thirty eight years old and I was considering retiring any way soon but not as abruptly as that obviously and part of the reason why I think that I didn't pursue\nA lot of opportunities back then is because in my mind I was capable\nFor years I assume the lack of beyond on my TV calling games and given commentary was because she was black I thought it wasn't enough that she made that incredible save her look wasn't the luck that America was ready to celebrate\nIn reality it was the sport I gave her so much that was not responsible for taking so much away\nI just couldn't keep my thoughts together I suffered\nKnow intense headaches every day I had you know vision issues I had I honestly felt like I couldn't learn anything new for a while because I couldn't\nMake it stick and then I couldn't recall it ... you know than the emotional stuff started to happen like anxiety and depression and you know panic attacks and things like that and so basically everything that I had planned on you know doing just went into a whole\nYear after um twenty eleven I was actually doing ESPN broadcasting for that twenty eleven World Cup\nAnd struggled every single day we were in Germany for thirty days and every evening I Would go to my hotel room and cry and cry and cry every day because I couldn't make anything stick my performance\nUm on screen and on air wasn't very good in my opinion I mean I couldn't remember the things I had said and\nYou know all these kinds of things that you deal with when you have concussion symptoms long\nTerm [noise] and you know after that time I just basically disappeared Brianna disappeared into a studio apartment in New Jersey and into the chaos of trying to receive treatment by the side effects of her career ending concussion\nBut I'm surprised when she told me that she wouldn't change a thing\nI met my current wife [laughter] I Would never met Krista without it and um you know now that I think back on it it was actually something that changed the path of my life in a in a good way I mean I'm happy is I've [laughter]\nIn my life and this is going to last until I'm Ninety or whatever I Hope and uh it's it's a it's something that at

Jones of Goldberg Jones' weight ... is the managing partner of a law firm that specializes in divorce for men the farm was founded twenty three years ago in Seattle back then most attorneys advertised in the yellow pages but Rick was looking\nFor a more affordable option and how long did it take you to find sports talk radio\nActually when the first time on Sunday doors\nOh please tell me it was like football season or something [laughter]\nAbsolutely which was January\nRick says he advertises on some other radio stations classic rock that sort of thing but nothing beats sports talk\nWhen you were looking at the advertisers look which just cannot graphic per year and it just really make church to spend money and it was sports radio station listenership Prussia\nSo you're reaching more men which I guess means that your cost per potential customers lower right\nIn many markets in sports talk radio definitely didn't break the ... when it comes to raiding the listeners are loyal and they're engaged\nFrom Hillsborough who's been calling in for like the last Fifteen Years and they you know Dave's have they\nWhere they can stave likes to eat at it's interesting to see the lengths they will go to keep both Dave and guys like Jones\nComfortable just to be crystal clear it's not the\nMassage any that keeps advertisers like rich Jones comfortable he's not a fan of that kind of thing this is kind of a weird question but if suddenly fifty percent of sports talk listeners were women would that make it less attractive as an advertising place for you\nYou know the answer is probably yes but let me explain why wages if they now had twice as many listeners as I Do now you can fully expected the amount you advertise level we reached frequent she would double shift and show the the only thing that you would change that the cost would\nDouble ... talk to executives that ESPN Radio and he was surprised by their response\nThey seem very cognizant of the fact that this is kind of very\nAntiquated approach but it works you I think terrestrial radio they are basically ushering in an entire generation\nAlong in a velvet coughing they have the audience they have they know they're engaged they know they buy things and they seem okay with that\nBut there's good news if you're a woman who likes sports because in some ways terrestrial radio is being replaced by other things pod cast send YouTube channels and Instagram and Facebook and in those spaces women aren't just allowed their welcomes\nESPN is investing in pod cast with women behind them bike I can watch my friend Andrea Kramer and Hannah Storm calling Thursday night NFL games on Amazon Prime and this sad play during last winters college football playoff\nIf you have this last\nYes it's sad I okay so the basic gist of this commercial is that the protagonist Anna is an architect her boss ignores her ideas and read her to my mind until one day\nYou didn't want to [laughter]\n\nMake architect says his anti Baker I'm sure this ad would inspire anyone who's ever had a bad boss but with that soundtrack nine to five is practically an anthem of second wave feminism that\nIs targeting me\nAnd it makes sense because on the TV side of things as more and more people cut the cord sports are pretty much the only thing anyone still watch it live this is\nWhy you see so many stations paying exorbitant Egypt for rights to broadcast games you know that's the only way you're going to get\nThat many eyeballs and one like him [noise] so yeah they they have to be nicer because they're not just trying to sell a trip to a steak house or something like that they're trying to sell cards they're trying to sell home loans they're trying to sell a bigger ticket item that more people than just stay from Hillsborough need\nAnd this is where the strategy of keeping the advertisers happy gets turned on its head I talked to Jennifer storms she's the chief marketing officer at NBC Sports grip and she says her main focus to attract advertisers\nWe want to make sure that we are always serving our consumers\nBut when NBC Sports looked at their audience their consumers they discovered that women already made up forty six percent of NFL fans\nNASCAR again another forty to fifty percent of NASCAR fans they are women so we're not wearing pink hats you know we're really into\nWomen were already enjoying NBC Sports products but\nWe took a look at it and then we said there's a real opportunity here to serve women even better and even more authentically and they are such large fans are sports property how do we give them more avenues more opportunity to express their fandom and engage with that\nLast winter during the Olympics NBC launched an initiative called on her turf it's a pod cast Instagram and YouTube campaign and it's not designed to attract women to sports it's designed to reach the women who already enjoy sports and inspire them to take on the world\nAnd in that spirit I have something to say that this guy\nI'm willing to share my sandbox as long as you remember your in my box\nThat sand box of yours it's getting smaller and smaller but this one over here the one that I'm
