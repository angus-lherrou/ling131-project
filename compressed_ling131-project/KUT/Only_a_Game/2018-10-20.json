he messaged her with an offer\nFor a couple of hundred dollars he would take a pair of shoes and hand paint them using her design ideas I Love watching cartoons I'm a big kid at heart\nAnd so I started to play around with the cartoons and things like that and since the WMBA has no color or design restrictions for its players shoes Simone took Scrooge make dark penny proud and even the care

me fairly early\nCan you tell me about the first time you remember feeling that way when I was very young I was as more of a tomboy I just absolutely hated having to like ... my hair and like put it a bow and I wear a dress and he was the first time that I sort of understood that like how I was presenting myself wasn't my\nChoice that turned into like self loading of my body based on what I thought I was supposed to look like I remember I Would watch TV shows and like desperately look to see if there is any woman not like wasn't skinny who was happy in the show\nWhen you were a teenager and you looked in the mirror what did you see oh I was like I'm a disgusting nice [laughter] I just\nHated ever looking in the mirror and being reminded of how I loved and then when I got into college I basically discovered exercise the way to lose weight and ... as a way to lose weight\nI copied the people I saw around me I starved bandaged I did what should be in a legal matter or bees\nIdea of

mindset that you will ever be happy no matter what you look like\nBefore a year ago I had no idea what power lifting lead and never been to a weight room there historically not designed for me way\nRooms were just weird place that I just didn't even recognize as a place that I could go like I had\nAbsolutely zero clue what you were supposed to do in a weight room I think it's intimidating for anyone who doesn't know what they're doing but it's especially intimidating if you're a woman because you feel like\nWhy are you here taking up space where all these like big burly men could be using the space that you're in\nModern gyms are rooted in all male institutions from the Greek gymnasium to bodybuilding gym so the twentieth century\n[laughter]\nSo how did you break through that how did you first start lifting weights\nSo I first started lifting weights because I was doing a program have bikini body in the name like it's very like not great but part of that program is they introduced the idea of using these very late ... and I really like I enjoy doing those I thought they were kind of fun\nBasically someone had been like well if you lift weights like three times a week you can get the same body for like half the amount of time I was like that sounds great of course we're going to try to do that\nThe first time I put up ... and I back I almost fell over I felt stupid I felt we and I felt very female\nI finished the rest of my SATs that I went home embarrassed\nIt was at a gym near my house and they only have one school Iraq\nSo you walk up very put up are in your back and you go to school why it's so weird and and so require so much balance your wobbling all over the place and you just feel very stupid and like someone is waiting to use the squalor I can I can clearly see you have no idea what you're doing\nI'm pretty short at that time was very skinny and it definitely was freaked out for a while for the first couple of months while I was doing it and I was like I don't approve them all wrong I'm going to get really strong [laughter]\nPower lifting as a brute sport it does not carry you look like and it's simple have you done more than the last time
