could to what what else do you do cry screen pray cries spring break right fame praying next thing you know I woke up I was at the hospital\nShe says that she apparently was so frenzied that an empty on the scene stuck with something\nTo calm me down so when I woke up see my family standing over me not that I'm\nNow as to what happened to Rodney that night Ben has looked at testimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses different court records to piece together the events yeah Rodney including all these documents that night Rodney in a sixteen year old cousin ... car they stopped at a gas station they let the gas station and we're driving down this a highway when\nHe and his little cousin or get pulled over by to a white officers\nThe officer said he saw him without a seatbelt turns out Rodney was wearing a seatbelt and these two officers approaches vehicle one is kind of standing in front of the car about several feet away towards like the driver's side and the officer approaches his window according to run these cuts and says boy why didn't you pull over sooner\nAnd a and then orders Rodney to put the current park and ride he's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel and he reaches down to put the current park\nAnd this is where things in the story started to bridge because the cops say the Rodney but the current part but then quickly put it back into Dr accelerated up the officer in front of the car\nRomney's cousin give two conflicting accounts as to what happened there was apparently and eyewitness across the street who said the car had yet to move but what is clear is what happened next which is the deputy and front pulls out his gun fires two shots into the windshield the deputy right by the door\nHere's the fire he pulls a gun and fires twice\nOne bullet went through on his left hand which could have been self defense another bullet entered through his left temple and the car largest forward and Koreans across the street for about three hundred yards until they clashed with this gas station Romney's cousin at this point gets out of the car fleet from the scene unharmed eventually paramedics arrived and pronounce Rodney dead at the scene\n\nMy mind is always on Rodney\nWith us she says when she does think about that night she always comes back to this one question why would the gospel\nWhy what ... what was that all about what\nDo you think the answer [noise] he's black\nThere for a moment where you try and put yourself in the minds of those two officers absolutely not because I never knew\nSomebody hit like that\nThat never crossed no I Would never do that\nYou feel like it's like do you feel like the cop in that moment it's rod nice black is what frightens a cop and that's why he pulled his gun out\nNow he's the bully held if he if somebody gets hurt us the money gets injured or killed he's going to get off\nHe's behind that blue bad she's building\nIs that what you think of cops like writ large that's how it is\nThat's exactly how it is not effective than buts about it\nBecause it's hard for me 'cause I think like like it's clear that there's discrimination would that exist within the police force and the people who they are sworn to protect and serve but like at the end of the day there's probably a hand like no I don't know I couldn't give you a percentage but a number of officers\nIn which like yes there are probably violent individuals who don't belong in a police force but I Would assume that like a majority of the cops mean well\nProbably probably have some sort of biased where they don't think I see a black person and I'm going to like I'm going to get that boy but that there is like a like there's some sort of triggered response\nAnd in that the police are constantly being put into different situations where they feel under threat and concerned and that like there's like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is shot and killed it's not just that they're out here bowling people\nYou say that because you're\nYou're white that's why you say that I tell you what I tell you what we can try this go to my sister will make sure we could get you a week to attend Islam it yourself spray black and I guarantee you get a different response\nAnd then you try to make sure we can make you look like a black boy I'm telling you you'll see a huge difference\nLike sitting like sitting there\nIn that moment I I felt I felt the Gulf and I just kept wondering like\nHow long does it take to fill that Gulf like how many ... what does it take a how many conversations to happen\nIn any case um do you want us to then still had to give ... those files on Rodney\nTo get those documents fear ... sure okay\nYeah so they can grab this huge folder of paper out of the trunk for a car [noise] walk back and said [noise]\nAnd put the ... tiles on this glass kitchen table [noise]\nBecause I don't want to be the person\nTo give you those unless you want me to go get them right now but there [noise]\nYeah when I'm ready out [noise]\nAnd then eventually see [noise]\nThree days later ... contacted Ben and said that she was ready to see those photos\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge thanks to Ben Montgomery the Tampa Bay times and to the staff\nOf that paper that did so much work gathering all the statistics and material that we use for this story a it was

because I Do I'm cooking at home where clay and produce is just so expensive that initial so cheap because it was so he can\nNext up the mosque radio hour two story home before a live audience I'm Jennifer ... is is our mistaken identity brains in formaldehyde and internal argument\nDown to get into bad faster and I can't wash it in fact I don't know the south of south center because I'm not married [noise]\nThat story and more\nUp next on them off radio hour from the Iraq right after they\nYeah yeah um is actually started talking about the fine um yeah but it went on like that for a while\nI Can't say\nThat I didn't think it was funny I did I also can't say that I Would write is now but I didn't know what is that phrase comedy plus tragedy or comedy quote tragedy plus time I didn't have any time um I Rosa Parks in on that bus so that I could wait around until this got funny I just started type [noise]\nI finished it in like twenty minutes and I sent it in to the editorial staff of newspaper published it\n\nAnd went to press on Thursday and it was published on line as well the website was a new thing we're trying um it was just sort of rudimentary website a social tax bill pictures um and I had my email address the bottom for praise and complements [noise]\nAnd I I that's what I thought was going to happen I thought people would write to me and say you're very funny and racism is bad [noise]\nWhich is the point of every fat tire 'em and that's ... that's the top of course had the title and it had my name my name is\nOur Eric Thomas Robert airtime is just my own it and my parents gave me the name of a neutral name I'm so that nobody would ever look at a job application or resume and deny me an opportunity because of my race which is a beautiful really heartbreaking way of trying to make a world for a person\nA and it's worked out well for me I've had a lot of job interviews races [noise]\nThat's true but here\nIf presented in issue because when you're in the wild west days of the Internet and you see something you read something that is sort of a satire but doesn't really a written very well and it says that black history is irrelevant and black people are important to the history of the country and it's written by a white guy you might get your feelings hurt\nAnd went to print on Thursday and I'm On line and by Sunday I had over a thousand emails in my inbox I saw for a brief moment that I made it [noise]\nBut then I open them and they said things like deer white and you are at Clinton's them and then you should die and I thought there might have been a misunderstanding summer\nBy the time I got back to campus on Monday things had\nReally escalated um and as a as I said nobody knew\nWho I was just so nobody like vouch for me so I write a follow up editorial I'm for the paper that said hello I'm black sorry\nBut the paper the paper only printed once a week every Thursday and we didn't know that you could just put anything online anytime you want to do because we literally didn't know how the Internet work [noise]\nSo it was just bad that black student union of which I was not a member a\nDecided to hold a town hall um to talk about the whole thing and I decided to go\nSuddenly this was these are my people right like this was about\nThe sign at the end of the day the signed that was on campus that we have to walk by all the time this was a community issue and so I I was going to go and be a part of the community\nSo I Walk into this huge lecture hall hundreds of people in their most if a diverse crowd but most of the faces\nAnd there are are black like mine um and uh I stood in the back\nUp and I'm not quite sure why but somebody to somebody to hold back um [noise]\nI mean history it varies I don't know me but there is never been a room that I've walked in that has a microphone in any including this room that I haven't wanted to get up and start talking to my room [noise]\nBut I didn't and I I watch this person to person walked up to the microphone and started talking about how angry they were at this white racist names are airtime is person after person kept talking about how they were furious and\nHurt them to share the KIPP is was this Nazi white supremacist named our time is I was like I feel very attacked right now [noise]\nIt's very confusing everyone was talking about me and nobody was talking about the fine which was a part of what I wrote and I turned to the guy next to me tall light skinned black looking at I was like this is really something isn't he was like yeah there are tons of sounds like a real [noise]\nMostly I just\nGrammar is impeccable [noise]\nWhen it continued nobody was talking about the science everybody was talking about me and I started to get flushed and I started to get angry and I started to feel so isolated just like I felt in the store I didn't understand I wrote\nA joke I wrote a fat tire 'em and nobody was laughing and everyone was angry at me and I I I didn't understand why they didn't see that I'd done this for a\nI'm Sorry I left because I was frustrated um\nAnd I didn't know how to fix it I couldn't just mark up to the front and say boy I caught [noise]\nI remember when I wrote I saw it big as a joke I wrote to make people laugh with me but the thing is what it was was riding the bus home I realized what should have been playing the obvious which is that like I wasn't laughing and\nI hadn't written what I wrote to make people laugh I wrote what I wrote to make people angry because it signed hurt my feelings and in the book store and alone in that store face to face with that time the hurt balloons into anger and I wanted more than anything not to be alone in anger I wanted to know that I was\nI was not the only person met felt to sway the only person that felt\nOppressed by this time\nAnd so widespread that anger accidentally to all these people ... through but I still felt alone and I still felt unseen and so I left them alone in that room which anger kind of amazing will do to reach each other\nI published the second editorial or that we connect sort of wealth things although the black student union did feel the need to censure me a which is sort of like an official rebuke I I kind of felt like it should come up like a few ticket but it does not\nAnd I received emails hate mail four months after that month so it was incredible I\nNever heard anything about this time though I never heard anything from the bookstore so they did take it down eventually who beginning of march because [noise]\n...

it's pretty fearless in Boise her concerns when she spots injustice [noise]\nRegular conversation and he thought spoken but when it counts when she needs to be heard like at a protest or march she's famous for having a voice so clear and booming she barely needs a bullhorn\nHeard are held a taxi once and that is no joke\nThey see a picture of any and her family and learn more about in synch and visit them off and ... oh\nOur next story comes from morally McBride she told it out a story slam in Brooklyn New York where we partner with public radio station WNYC the theme that night was happy you're on\nRight [noise]\nSo I used to think that your twenties for the most most with time and your life but it turns out totally wrong because right around the corner from your twenties or your thirties [noise] and my thirties hit me with an unexpected and pretty debilitating case of anxiety yeah [laughter]\nUp until that point I felt like I always had some sort of like inner confidence almost like a pilot light that just gave me some some some sense of certainty that things would be All right but then all of a sudden one day it was like the storm cause rolled in\nThat light went out and there was nothing just an empty space were had once been [noise] and I felt totally paralyzed lost my own thoughts I Would just ruminate endlessly about tiny details and second guess any decision that I made it all\nSo during these rough patches I find myself I found myself kind of looking out the world for signs that you know things were going to be okay\nAnd the science included dramatic moments like when a rainbow seem to frame the finish line of a marathon I was running or even just little daily moments like when you go down to the subway and the train arrives right as you get there and it stops with the doors centered right on you\nFound real comfort in these tiny moments [noise]\nBut when sort of during the point of rock bottom nests feeling this way I went out for a run one afternoon and made the sort of impulsive stop at the farm stand on my way home and bought a bag of spinach because one\nAnd this bag or spinach was huge it was like the size of the toddler really it has roots in rocks and dirt and sand and everything in it and it only cost a dollar fresh fresh produce in New York for a dollar I was delighted delighted by the deal\nAnd lucky for me actually only had a dollar I hadn't planned on going to shopping while running so I use that like really crusty emergency dollar bill that you probably have stuck in your shoes somewhere\nSo anyway I bought the spinach headed home and lay down on the couch to rest\nAnd I was on line there my mind begins to wander and I'm thinking how am I going to eat all that spinach that's awful lot of spinach always buy too much produce and always goes bad before I get a chance to cook it and it goes bad before I get a chance to cook it because I don't cook at home because I work late\nAnd produce is usually so expensive in New York you know that's been it was so cheap because it was so dirty\nAnd I can't even I Can't even wash it to make it more\nConvenient to cook I if it gets damp it's just going to go bad faster and I can't wash it and drag 'cause I don't have a salad spinner um south dinner because I'm not married\n[laughter]\nSingle I'm In my thirties admitted nine weddings in the last nine months and that's when you get all your kitchen lined up ... calories salads but I haven't seen it all\nIf I were married I Would have that stuff but what I live in New York now in kitchens are so small here where we put all that stuff microwave already blocked my biggest cabinet do they even make smaller versions of these things how am I going to eat all that spinach [noise]\nEventually I fall asleep this been cycle finally quieted by dreams and when I wake up hustle out of the house the meeting some friends for a movie and if I'm crossing the street you know how\nIn New York people be things that they don't really want on the curb like an old mattress ... books or like a ... from the late nineties but\nI'm crossing the street and you'll never guess what is sitting on a student\nActually sort of a stone wall across the street from me\nA miniature ... [laughter]\nI'm not kidding a salad spinner for one [noise]\nIt's sitting all by itself\nAround other things not part of a pending trash collection it's sitting on a clean while across the street from me on this random Saturday just waiting for me [noise]\nAnd I see it and I you know I've never I've never even seen as many thousand before I didn't I didn't\nKnow if they made these things and it's tiny it fits in the palm of my hand I mean it's ... it's actually really adorable\nUpon seeing things free things on the curb a younger version of me would be like oh that natural slicks so comfortable like lists laser fit me but having lived in New York for a couple of years now I'm more like bedbugs I Know you're in there [laughter]\nSo as I finally train myself to do I acknowledge this amazing salad spinner and just walk on and I get to the end of the block and I stopped cold in my tracks because my stomach is on fire and I'm like W. E. T. F. that\nThat might ballots that are\nGoing to turn around I reach back up the block grabbed a salad spinner running back to my apartment straight to the bathroom throat in the bathtub drawback squirt dish washing detergent generously all over it and I'd like to take that you'll\nI'm an ex morning the next morning I wake and I clean the salad spinner off in earnest and that's you know retrieving it from the bath tub and I'm sort of marveling at its existence and how it came to me and it's like clean my fingers run across um I I notice it's brand name and my fingers run across\nSubtle in boxing on the talk of the lead and you know what that little South Bend his name was ...\nA tiny cell Center for one name ... [noise]\nI think all the time they're really useful you should get one even if you're a single\nMost importantly that little\nThing brought me so much hope and so much joy in a time where I really was digging deep and couldn't find it anywhere it became like a mini mascot almost it was sort of ... ah\nJust the ultimate ... for me and it now sits on my kitchen window so prominently as sort of a reminder of you know you're having faith and an optimistic future because you never know what ... might come your way when you need it the most thinking\n[noise]\n... is a design strategist\nA few years after this story morally moved out of New York city and back to Colorado where she got a place with a lot more states though she got herself a matching large triumph salad spinner and a husband did see a picture of triumph the tiny salads minute for one you can visit the mosque dot org [noise]\nEveryone out there listening with a story starting to ruin your heart and we want to hear at least pitch a story by recording it right on our site in the ... or call\nEight seven seven seven nine nine months that's eight seven seven seven nine nine six six eight\nOr the vestiges of developed from off shows all around the world\nMy name is Elaine ...
