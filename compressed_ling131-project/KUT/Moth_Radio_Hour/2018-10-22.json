Rated movie theater and now it's the front page of a newspaper man all those things the same time it's all those things at the same time in in what we hear the users are demanding of them is that they create a set of policies that are just\nIn the reality is justice means a very different seeing in each one of the setting\nJustice would mean that the person in Mexico gets told the truth in Mexico by Facebook and the little boy in England doesn't have to look at something gory and horrible in England but you can't put them together because they clash exactly so how do you solve that\nI don't know I\nThink it's important to keep in mind that\nEven if you have the perfect set of policies that that somehow managed to be just in different settings and that can be consistently enforced the people at the end of the day making these decisions they're still\nA [noise] [noise] [noise] they're still they're still human being is this working or no they can hear it yeah yeah\nI spoke to one woman who did this work for Facebook I wanted to be a non ...\nCall her Marie she's from the Philippines where she grew up on a coffee farm\nThat's my father's a girl\nShe said many afternoons well she was growing up she and her mother would sit together like outside tuning into their short wave radio\nThey're listening to the voice of America\nOngoing drive by the ...\nOne of the great eventually\nI'll fall but we find fault with [noise] with them [noise]\nThat forward fifty years to twenty ten and Marie is consuming a very different sort of American media there were\nTimes when I felt really bad that I Am a Christian and then I looked into this things\nShe became a content moderator back in ... and she and the other moderators on her team who lived throughout the Philippines they were trained on the guidelines on this rule book\nBased on my concern about the background there are things that that I can ... objectively odd so ... many of the things that I think are not\nAcceptable she said whether something was outside the rules are not just forgot told her to she just took it down\nBecause if it's going to disturb the young odds and then you shouldn't have to be there so like if there's a new burst on\nWhether it was breastfeeding photo or an anatomy video or a piece of art\nThat would consider this pornography\nSo yeah I have to protect kids\nFrom those\nA site of humankind [noise]\nWho is it leaves you feeling leave you feeling that this is just that the and this is just I'm\nA new um [noise] I I I think they will inevitably fail but they have to try and and and I think we should all be rooting for [noise]\n\n\n[noise] Hi I'm Tracey show cheered listen to K.

coming up on the moth radio hour from PR acts right after this\nSo one day it was Ramadan and Muslims fast during Ramadan\nSo I hadn't eaten all day\nAnd I was actually fix the day before so I hadn't been for two days in a row and I was like today's the day\nAnd I went to ... while\nIn my way to Richard comes up to me and I'm like Richard I'll take the hog wild nachos challenge\nAnd he looked me dead in the eyes and he was like listen buddy\nThere ain't no way in hell in a raft going to eat that many nachos [noise]\nWhich I've heard a lot of stereotypes before [noise]\nI just don't feel like you're just you [noise]\nI haven't heard of the old Arab or the nacho saying [noise]\nSo at first I just wanted to eat a lot of Knoxville\nBut to combat racism [noise]\nI was going to eat all the nachos [noise]\nI'm not even Arab I'm pockets on but [noise]\nIn solidarity with the Arab people I was like I'm gonna do this [noise]\nAnd I saw my way inch by inch through eight pounds of nachos [noise]\nAnd I'm proud to say that I successfully completed that challenge [noise]\nEverything like hey Omar or should I Do that of course not it was a horrible mistake\nSeven point seven five pounds to make sure [noise]\nBut my body ... horrible afterwards my mom's a doctor so afterwards I called and I was like mom\nI think I might be dying [noise]\nAnd she was like yeah you probably are [noise]\nFat babies waiting nachos [noise]\nMan it's a miracle if you survive [noise]\nAnd you're the five of sort of by the way the problem we've got to have your picture put on the wall [noise]\nThis is the story of super bastards ever assembled\nWhat did you just like every single diner pictures was wearing suspenders [noise]\nNot like a cool Brooklyn hipster way\nFor him to like ... not going to work [noise]\nAnd so after I finish Richard the waiter comes up to me of like that was incredible I did not think you could do that\nAnd on bat day I'm proud to say that I earned Richards respect [noise]\nAnd I got to tell you wasn't worth it should not have done that\nAnd I started to really love all parts of Missouri and after a while we started to get a pretty big\nSome population in southwest Missouri and the reason why it's hard to these big issue down there and Muslim to go to med school [laughter] so\nWe're like we got you baby [noise]\nAnd we started to get such a big Muslim population in the area that we're able to open up our own mosque and drop in Missouri [noise] yeah [noise]\nAnd it was a super important place for us because not only would people be able to practice their religion we finally had to face to do that but it was important for us to have a sense of community like there were little girls and little boys who had asked\nWho spoke with accents or who were here jobs had farce than to class and in rural Missouri that was very hard for them so a lot of them didn't have the confidence to speak up\nBut by having them off their could teach people public speaking and allow them to express their identity as they see fit they started to get braver and they started to get more proactive in classes and the place matter\nTo them and it was great having the mosques in my home town then I went to college on the east coast and\nI was just poking around and I wanted to see how the Mona cubs high school football team was projected to do in the upcoming season\nSo I pull up the local newspaper website drop on the globe and the headline read Joplin ... mosque burned to the ground\nAnd it was during Ramadan and I knew that my parents were there the night before\nAnd I couldn't allow myself to think of the reality that might have happened so I pick up my phone and I called my dad\nAnd the phone rang and rang and there was no answer and then I called my mom and my sister and my brother no response\nI kept calling throughout the night and finally at six in the morning my dad picks up he was like hello you live [noise]\nIt was like yeah I think the phone call subtle ...\nAnd I told him at the mosque I'd been burnt down and he said that he left before anything like that happened then he doesn't want to call and make sure that everyone was All right and they were\nAnd I would later watch\nThe security camera footage of this because we knew that something bad like this might happen\nAnd you see\nA face in black and white look up\nAt the camera you could see his eyes extra white and he smiles\nAnd then he turned back down in the next thing you saw was flames burning the building and I knew that we could not rebuilt this mosque\nBecause no matter how much it meant to our community no matter how much good it did it was worth nobody's life\nCertainly not my family\nAnd so with that in mind I pledge to make sure that no one would rebuild\nThis mosque sedan I came home over break and I asked my dad to take me to black cat lane which is where the mosque used to stand\nAnd the entire building had been burned to the ground and the only thing left was a mailbox and in that mailbox was a letter addressed to the Muslims\nA few years before the mosque was burned down Joplin, Missouri had the worst tornado and basically American history leveled\nThe town and to try to help out the Muslims in the community opened up a free clinic so people because he always so backed up it was helpful to have a free clinic for more minor\nOnes and that letter said when the tornado struck\nI had nowhere to go\nNo one would take my daughter\nAnd my wife but\nYou did I don't understand you know I don't understand your religion but what I Do understand is that is that when we needed you you were there for us but when you needed us we weren't there for you\nBeing a Muslim in Missouri means that you have to endure things that you never thought you would have to him that no one should\nBut I learned that day that it matters and it's worth it and so we keep trying to get [noise]\n\nIn the Muslim community in very continues to thrive\nThe mosque was rebuilt and the good deeds continue after\nThe fire many of the local churches and synagogues gathered to support the Muslim community Omar says that is typical Missouri he still loves to place\nHowever ... on my Web sad to learn that hog wild home a V. eight pound nacho challenge has closed its doors but we were able to get a copy of Omar picture displayed on the wall after his Victoria's mail you can see it at the ... Oregon\nBut when we return to stories of love beginnings and ending also another tornado ...

live in South Dakota [noise]\n\nSo when I got married I was a D I why crusty crazy person\nExcept I've heard it's something of some kind of spiritual intimacy practice where people meet each other as\nGods and goddesses\nAnd there's a lot of eye contact [noise]\nI'm craving intimacy you know I just want to want\nOut and have fun and play but\nI'm scared to of course to get out there but\nThen the email came this invitation for ... painting party and I thought I can do this I like pain [noise]\nAnd now I'm Wondering what does one where [noise]\nTo a naked\nAnd I'm starting to have second thoughts about the whole thing but I Can't back out because they have to have an exact count and they're always scrounging forgot it says [noise]\nHold on a long\nLose stress and grab my rooster mask I\nSo the party takes place at a nice suburban home in the hills of Southern California of course [noise]\nAnd\nI'm greeted at the door by friends was who was a voluptuous sex all adjust and she leads me out to the back yard which is like some kind of midsummer\nNight's Dream there's twinkle lights and the trees and a table overflowing with fruit and wine and I can see the paints glistening over there on the patio and there's all these interesting people there are women walking around with just like to\nDaisies tied down with little strings\nAnd France was keeps bringing more and more interesting lush as people out into the yard and then she brings out my ex husband [noise]\nSo far and then I'm like hey God there's someone here I Know [noise]\nLike no no no no don't look at me I'm trying to be single here and I just keep looping like horrified grateful and he's\nSomehow we just managed to go forward into the party and avoid each other\nThen France was rings that go wrong and gathers us all together\nFor the push it which of these spiritual exercises a we're all still close at this point I Want to assure you and she gets all of us women together in a circle facing out\nAnd all the men are around us facing and sort of partnered up and she's going to lead us through these exercises where every goddess will connect with every God\nSo here I Am facing the stranger looking into his eyes and\nI'm really pretty surprised at how easy\nIt is to connect with a stranger\nJust looking into his eyes and not saying anything [noise] and then we back now and we step to the side and then friends\nWas asks us to put our hand on our partners heart\nAnd\nThen his hands on my heart and I look into his eyes and I breeze and then I bow and step to the side face another new partner\nNow for this one the man is the Rockies shore and I am to be the ocean washing up\nAnd then we'd bell [laughter] step to the side\nAnd then there's no avoiding it yeah\nYou saw it coming [noise]\nI'm face to face with the man that I was married to for Twenty one years\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd France was doesn't know us\nBut the ... that she puts out to the group at that point is\nYou to have known each other for a very long time [noise]\n\n[noise] you\nHave a rich and complex history [noise]\nAnd feel\nAll of that up and then release each other into your future [noise]\nSo we gaze into each other's eyes [noise]\nCan't help noticing a finally trimmed his eyebrows [noise]\nHaving more eye contact right now than we probably had in the whole last year of our marriage [noise]\n[noise] and then we hold each other\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd we feel all of that\nComplexity\n[noise] [noise]\nBecause you see we never had a divorce ritual\nI remember the moment that the mediator pushed the paper across the desk and I was to put a check mark in a box that said dissolution of marriage\n\nAnd it hit me this is this is the moment after more than two decades a grand wedding two daughters all of our birthdays and anniversaries and Twenty one New Year's eve and this is it it comes down to a check mark in a box\n\nAnd when I started to cry the mediator said oh I always hate it when people cry\nReally ... maybe you should get a different line of work\nBut now here we are\nLife and France was given us a divorce ritual\nSo we hold each other and we feel all of that complexity\nIn depth [noise] [noise]\nAnd then we really see each other into our separate futures [laughter] [noise]\nAnd bell and stepped aside\nAnd complete the circle and in\nFrance was shoes
