I don't see chair and lioness who had a shot where he was kind of pale and he was in the ...\nThe swimming in the dark in the living room and I could kind of see him through the arch way and the darkness and he just felt like he was on the other side of a divide he felt like he was swinging away from me and I got this horrible ... of the stomach feeling I was like you know\nThat doctor and so I I called her back you know the next day and I was like listen I really want to get him checked out she's like All right we'll get his eyes check before we started doing neurological testing so I made an appointment with my doctor\nAnd this was the winter and all of a sudden New York city was hit with this terrible blizzard was two thousand and three December fish\nAnd the whole city was just like snowed in with this horrible blizzard in here I was I was going to take this three month old baby in on the subway in a blizzard because I had a bad feeling but I went ahead and I I did it and I got to the doctor's office and they dilated his pupils\nAnd the doctor got very very quiet and he disappeared into the back room and he came back\nA business card for um a mandated Dr Abramson who was the world's leading specialist um in Britain ... a very rare kind of cancer\nAnd he said your son has a massive tumor on his written a of his right eye and you need to go get a treated right away and a week later we had started chemotherapy\n[noise] and\nI never knew a child so young could even get cancer I'd never heard of anything like this and so my husband and I went into like straightforward battle mode it's like we were going to take care of this we were going to be in control we were going to do everything that we could we went to Sloan Kettering every three weeks they would gas him they would examine is either they would find a new tumor\nWe go back three more weeks they ... him and his either they find another two or three tumors\nWas ultimately Thirteen tumors and all\nAnd I kept looking for answers it's like what could cause something like that so that's the doctors it's like you know what caused this and it's like nothing causes it to random mutations\nBut I couldn't believe that it's like clearly it wasn't my ... he was three months old you know in smoked three packs of cigarettes a day in lying in the tanning bed you know something must have caused this and it must be me\nBecause I was his mother and it was my job to protect him and I had failed\nAt the one job at a mother is given which was to protect my son\nAnd it was about this time that the dirty diapers started\nWhen my daughter was little we had this beautiful house and Clinton hill and had a front porch and one morning when my daughter was maybe seven or eight months old I come out and I just almost tripped over this like dirty diaper that was sort of rolled up on the welcome mat\nAnd I I was like ... you know some random piece of garbage in Brooklyn so I picked it up and I do it in the trash I didn't think anything more of it in a couple of days later it came out and there was another dirty diaper that was right on the welcome mat and I'm like Mm this doesn't feel so random anymore\nAnd maybe another week would go by and another dirty diaper and I couldn't figure out where they were coming from and who I made an enemy of and and then I remembered that our babysitter gotten into some like turf war with another baby sitter on the playground and I was like this is a language I don't even speak I'm not going to get stressed out about it\nBut now it came when my son was sick and I walked out with the double stroller and I almost tripped over another dirty diaper again and this time I just kind of lost my\nRegularly on this and I was like who is out to get my family and I ... and the dirty diapers kept coming and I couldn't figure out who was\nAnd about the same time my daughter who is three years old started to get weird on me too and she wouldn't go into the boys bedroom and she and and every time she'd go into the boys bedroom she would point at the closet and she started crying and she's like a bad\nNo lives Sarah bad no lives there and now with her three year old word for bird and she's like there is a bad bird that lives in the closet and so I'm for you know it's like there's you know like diapers coming or the\nBad bird that lives in the closet and my son has cancer so I did what any rational mother would do [laughter] I went to Chinatown and I bought this enormous plastic dragon that was so big I seen it in a store\nAnd I thought that somehow will protect my children because this is\nLooking mother and dragon and it's like they should care the black bird in the closet right so I hung dragon over the ...\nUm and the next day I Walk into the boys bedroom and the ... right I have that dragon\nIs on the floor\nAnd Ellis says to me she's like the not picked it out\nAnd I'm like a grip on yourself\nGot hot glue gun but by that\nI you know I went to bed the next night Ella come screaming into our bedroom with a doll that she has it should be given for Christmas and she's like my cousin is eight my son is missing\nAnd the right eye of her doll was gone and my husband was not superstitious at all even he was freaking out at this point and he went under her bed and he found the right eye of the dollar was under her bed and so by\nThis time I'm like I'm reaching out to anybody I reached out to a neighbor who is very well versed in the ...\nAnd\nSomebody's added in for you you definitely been curse and you need to get a priest in here and exercises house and you need to sleep a Bible in the window of the boys bedroom but I'm rational and not like I'm not going to go to some ... park slope runs mistreated like I'm going to go to the Sloan Kettering up the town of ...\nSo I get on a number to train and I go straight to flat Bush\nAnd I'm walking around like looking for I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for but it's like a climate Metallica\n[noise] and it's like love\nPotions and money powders and you know the scandals of the ... shows that are masquerading as Catholic saints and I walk in there and there's this guy\nThat sitting behind a wall of bullet proof\nGlass like it's a liquor store and just got out of it as like blue white eyes that word went out he was cataract and he was like eating a from a Styrofoam bowl of cup of noodles rice there's like ... noodles and I walk in [laughter]\nExcuse me\nI'm someone put a curse on my house and my family and I need something to fight back\nAnd he kind of not not as a shelf it's like down below and it's all these brown bottles of something called ... and I look at us like wash it's like I don't\nLike what do you take me for some it's like [noise] and so I I turned back and was like no no no\nI don't think you understand somebody is waging supernatural warfare on my family and you're trying to sell me floor while I Need something that\nMarked melting Lee lovely strong\nAnd she had a fierce belief in the possibility of occasional magic and I could have married her and I didn't\nAnd that was it and I had no idea what to do I come back on active duty to um spend the second year in Vietnam because I hadn't found a place where myself a in a very changed America when I went back from the first\nUh and here I was at the end of the second year and still didn't know what to do\nNow this sad tale or is not just me this is my mother as well\nWe will we raised one another we practically grew up together she was a girl when I was born and then we raised my two younger brothers um this this woman who supported me all my life and she heard that on me and married another man and she said you stupid boy you stupid\nStupid boy [laughter] and didn't talk to me for several weeks [laughter] that's a pretty\nPathetic a figure but this hopelessness I knew what the focus of it was okay and I just had to hold it in\nBecause I couldn't show it to the world I live to ... to Mike for six hundred mountain tribesmen and Seventeen Green Berets and our job was to be the cavalry when special forces camps or along the border areas came under siege\nAnd so they expected me to be steady to be serious and I presented this daily in this hard face as I could to the world\n\n[noise] well I guess that was probably off putting enough that nobody in the gang noticed when I got a letter a letter some of you may not know what a letter is\n[noise]\nIs what we what we did before Snapchat and Twitter and email and so forth and it came on paper [laughter] I got a letter from the girl told me\nShe said I'm divorced period bang [noise]\n\nShe said I thought I Would be traveling perhaps in Southeast Asia [noise]\nProbably at the end of August well that happened to be just one of my tour I I'm Sorry the end of October that's exactly when my tour and did and I knew later I mean I sorted out that she had been talking to my mother [noise]\nWell I went into a military precision mode I started by getting a car and\nDriver in Bangkok where we're going to me I mean the way she put it let's why not ... let's just meet in Bangkok\nIs if what you know to people who knew each other vaguely would go to the oriental hotel and have tea you know but I knew this was serious for her yeah and so I wanted to make everything just right but the timing was a crucial element\nBecause this is a woman who hadn't had in the years I had known her ten dollars per se I mean the same ten dollars at one time\nAnd I do if she managed somehow to buy this ticket to bank up\nThat she was going to arrive broke and so I had to be there and so I'm not planning on time was meticulous I figured out how long would take I had one day for every movement every time I had to change planes every time I had to walk across the street we add a day I'm going to get their forties early as my target is four days early and then I threw it in another three days [noise]\nLook I'm playing for my life here [noise]\nAh so ah and then very quickly you know we're getting into the the middle of October and the uh\nThe fellow who was relieving may has reported for duty and I've signed over the equipment weapons to him or we've shaken hands it's essentially done and I don't get out the door quite fast enough with a message comes in and says one of our post or on the lotion border has come under siege and we have to go do our part to save them\nOr I could have left but in truth none of none of my guys expected me too because the new guy didn't even know everyone's name yet and you can't really expecting the march off to war or when he's just hey you sort of sort of relationships so I put\nDown my pack bags and went back to the war\nUm we went up to the camp a it was an ugly bit of business or they were being shelled by heavy mortars and artillery um and we push back the foreign observers the eyes and ears of the artillery and then we went after the guns themselves\nAnd eventually it was all over and I had a day left um but I rushed to an airplane um without being London manifest against the rules and got down to Saigon and I had one day to find a way to Bangkok\nI was five days till the next commercial flights when across and three days until\nThe embassy courier flight went to Bangkok and at the end of a long and very frustrating day arguably the darkest day of my life a guy said captain you can't get there by the twenty eighth even if you hijacking airplanes [noise]\nI felt like I couldn't worries I felt like I had somehow been hit with something and so I went to the special forces club [noise] the bar there or was open seven days a week twenty four hours a day for eight years all in all [noise]\nAnd I went there and I had a lot of\nMoney in my genes I was you know and so I drank good scotch and after three after three scotch as generously bored of it came to me I could fix this\nI was going to drink myself to death in that bar I told myself you're not leaving here until they carry you out dead\nAnd just as I started into that mode in through the door comes Martha Ray Maggie re the patron saint of the Green Berets now some of you may not know who Martha Ray is or was\nUm [noise] she was born in Nineteen sixty or by Nineteen Twenty one she was a headliner in vaudeville she made her first movie in Nineteen thirty four made thirty more of them are three times with Bob Hope but my favorite movie most ... do\nA she played with Charlie Chaplin she acted him right off the screen through the entire movie and he was the director and producer [noise]\nSo Megan came in and she and I had known each other since the beginning of that second tour might\nAnd and we had a good relationship we had shared common interest we'd like good coffee and vodka and movies and we spend a lot of time talking about that well she walked in surveyed her domain there\nI'm Maggie a you know had been there six months a year for seven years and it wasn't the do shows and it wasn't to promote herself or her career or anything she just came and largely just hung around with the guys with the Green Berets she was a cheerleader she was our confidant\nWell she walked in as I say she surveyed heard domain\nAnd then she looked at me and she sat down in order to drink and gave me a huge stage frown tap my hand and said Larry what's wrong I said maybe I've just screwed up my whole life\nThere's one girl she's going to be in Bangkok I'm not going to be able to get there I don't know what I'm gonna do I I've just ruined everything are just completely follow this whole thing up and I said she's gonna arrive in Bangkok\nShe's going to be broke she's going to wait a day maybe two and then she's going to have to go home\n\nMaggie thought about it for a minute he's she said\nLarry are you sure that this girl is that important because there are an awful lot of ways to have fun in this world without you know just invent yourself all over again I said no baggage she's absolutely the girl I Want the girl I Need the girl I Want to marry that this is this is everything she's it\nAnd she gave me another pause and then she said we'll fix this we're going to go tomorrow and see the head of the seventh air force it's a four star general and we're going to fix this will get you a ride you get in Bangkok on time\nAnd so I went to the to my room and woke up in ten minutes later the adrenaline in mid burned off all the hangover and I was ready for the day and I marched out to uh to uh meet Maggie and off we went to see the head of the seventh Airforce\nWe walked into the building a ... minute airfield that said headquarters seventh Airforce through the door and there are signs that say executive suites this direction maybe understood that the real head of the seven third force was not the four star general who got in the pictures it was a senior noncommissioned\nOfficer who really ran the place command master sergeant Francis Patrick my honey not Mahoney your God no my honey [noise]\nAnd so [laughter]\nMy honey operates in a huge bay a disease of people doing busy and important work in a sort of Plexiglas cube that's his office so he can see in every direction\nAnd I'm left to sit outside Maggie is received like royalty inside and she her just ... get Wilder and while there's he's pointing over her shoulder may\nBut my honeys head is slowly turning this way and what was his smile is turn to a oh my God [noise] um [noise] and the issue is in real doubt I can tell because Maggie cries Maggie only cried on cue [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Austin", "day": "15"}
