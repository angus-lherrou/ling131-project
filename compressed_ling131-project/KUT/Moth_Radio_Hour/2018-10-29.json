{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Um eat them in a wheelchair ever since he was captured he'd\nBeen shot in the foot an arm and I'm so he is presumed to be paralyzed\nUntil in September in Nineteen Seventy eight he escaped from his room and he was on the list again\nHe so he wasn't paralyzed he was not paralyzed he's faking it he was faking it for all those years or four years jeez yeah so he had a hit list apparently that was founded the salad had the lawyers names on it had the prosecutors and the judge I think had like a whole bunch of people are related to the case\nWas our money's name on there and on his name was on that mhm and the allergies I'm really so so he leaves and ... and goes where no one knows but he's not in the immediate area as far as I can tell they pull out all the troops again they're searching this area that's like\nBrambles against brush around the prison\nAnd in the meantime this is our money's version I'm Henry McCabe the same investigator from before during the manhunt shows up at his door\nTells him that go has escaped again and says listen we had such a hard time catching him last time around is there anything you can tell us this time it might help us in our money says like oh jeeze yeah I mean\nI think what he's going to do is hunker down right next to the prison is going to wait until he is going to be able to monitor you guys when he knows he's moved on and cleared the area and he'll make or break for it and go so probably still right nearby\nYou should go back and catch him how does she knows that well so that's the thing he Daryl basically I think talked about that on the stand to explain how they did during the manhunt so it's possible that this wasn't news but our money claims that he told that to McCabe who thought it was helpful\nSo um they went back six theory again and sure enough he was there have popped up and he had managed to have a gun that had been smuggling him by his son a few days earlier and he shot the first officer that came near him and then all the officers opened fire on him and he was killed [laughter]\n\nSo so look at where we land here like like this this this small town lawyer who took on a case not because we want to do with somebody should who defended this fellow for all this time who suffered so for doing over the ...\nIs it more or less give up his practice in small town utterly changed his life\nAnd you're stuck to his guns and he and he and he stayed with this guy and yet\nOnce he's escaped and he's at large and the police come and say tell us what you know about your client all of a sudden he does tell you have to go to the bushes ... nearby that's interesting because because it basically after all this he more or less sets up the situation where the the kill says\nYeah it's like why is it okay in the second scenario and not\nIn the first scenario with the buried bodies right yeah well interestingly Lisa learning the or the ... the law professor that we spoke with for this episode she says that when she teaches this case to her law classes\nUm you know like even if you presume that this was privileged information which ... says it wasn't as Garrett talked about on the stand but at least is that even if it were privileged information and only\nArmani knew\nHe could still reveal it in this case ethically really why\nBecause you go back and look at roll one point six which is the current ethics code it says a lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent that we're reasonably believe is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death\nOr substantial bodily harm\nSo\nSo you could quibble about this you know is this just this meet that standard but once Carol is on the ... you know knowing what Frank knows about his having committed multiple previous murders\nMy reaction is that it was very reasonable\nBut in our case had the highway if he had not had a hit list and when she looked like he was going to murder more people if he had not threaten their lives if instead he was going to sneak out and simply go to ... on a plane if he could get to it\nThere are lawyers would not have been able to tell them about the highway place because no one was going to die\nYou know if I had been representing\nThis man and he was on the loose\nThan if I knew that he had killed several people and that he is\nA sociopath or something like that I Would I Would estimate the odds of his injuring or killing other people as very high because serial killers that's what they do\nYou know if it were another case and he was just going to run off someplace and there was no danger to anyone\nUh then maybe it would be different what is the argument that would be against that with me since I can think of it the argument against that is\nEven if someone tells you\nThe secret as his attorney or her attorney you're supposed to keep the secret when there is a\nConclusion of the case in person as either innocent or guilty how long must you keep the secret like forever so over ever for over why\nUh well the the idea is that um if you want clients to be able to speak freely to their lawyers\nUm the the lawyer is simply the clients agent the lawyer has that information at the behest of the client it's not the lawyers decision to reveal it\n[laughter]\nThanks to our producers printer feral and not guilty and to Jim Tracy who is currently writing a book about all this the working title is twisted so thanks also to Tom Allen brandy author of privilege information with Frank

producer or stopping cruise Simon ... David ... not to be ... column which any human anti knows the teeth not\nMelissa ... ... ... ... anybody but how from Alexander Lee Young Seventy Chan pile only fact checkers\nAnd the gosh a shocking I think [noise]\nAnd this method\nGood evening I'm Tracy show you're listening to Austin's NPR station K. U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one often you can find a salon a K. U. T. O. R. G. community supported public radio from the below center at UT Austin thank you so much for listening\nRight now I can you T. O. R. G. can reach such stories as Austin water lifts boil water notice\n[laughter] and I also think there's an article there called activist simulate brutal ... trick for clean water as a reminder they are blessed\nYou can find that story and more right now a K. U. T. dot O. R. G. it's eight o'clock that means it's time for the moth radio hour\n[noise]\nI decided to close the door on gambling blackjack poker it didn't matter what form that part of my life was that\nI fell in love and I moved to Seattle to be with this woman and you know Seattle's a little bit different from New York the city it as a city where nobody is trying to accomplish\nAny\nStories told when live I'm In this hour we'll hear from a black cat there alone in the back of his life and nine year olds are members being crushed by the new edition family\nI kept going back for more I kept going to\nI remember the first time I froze\nThere you go to war you think\nYou're going to be brave [noise]\nIf you don't think that you probably don't go to\nThat story and more coming up on the moth radio hour from the public radio exchange PR X. dot org right after this\nEyes and he's all but gone expressions a in a gamblers anonymous and I was suddenly hears with the exact sort of people that I used to pride myself and sort of feather my ego by ... regarding myself at the very opposite of\nA and that's how I finished my poker and sometime after that I finished up my book it was published and then I got a job as a freelance job um\nBut still they paid me they send me a check every couple of weeks which I found off putting at first until I learned that those are fungible as well and uh\nI decided to close the door on gambling\nBlackjack poker it didn't matter what form that part of my life was over I fell in love and I moved to Seattle to be with this woman and you know Seattle's ... is a different is a little bit different from New York the city it as a city where nobody is trying to accomplish any [noise]\nIt was a a good place for the state of mind that I was entering [laughter]\nWalk and ... contemplate evergreen trees are on the on the rare occasions when I was a clear day contemplate the mountains or the sound\nUh and I was every day at a certain time I was practicing a form of but ... but his Dick meditation so it sit for an hour and a state of a ... and one day um during the time that I usually reserve for equity a I wandered into a casino because in\nIn Washington they have with the the Khomeini 'cause you know these small independently operated places with ... limits and they have blackjack and a couple of their games and I knew from my car counting days that small a ... you know independent operations are often\nUm sources of unusual value for car counters they have special vulnerabilities in their games from time to time they have some procedural a errors or extravagant says that can be beneficial and so I was going around and I started playing a little bit of blackjack\nUm and I want a little bit of money and when you when a little bit of money the next logical step is to win a large\nAnd the amount of money I had in mind that would be good as a goal was fifty thousand dollars the money that I lost play online\nPoker I should make myself hole and this idea both thrilled me but it gave me a little bit of trepidation because when you're a skilled gambler when you're a cart cowed or a competent poker player or what have you\nIf you lose money it's absolutely consistent with your own rational self interest to play that much harder and that much longer in an effort to win back what you have lost because you will the long run will be good\nBut if you're a pathological gambler just a normal losing gambler the worst idea you can possibly have is the idea that you must be made whole\nBecause the whole will continue to grow and this is the very source of the pathological spiral\nHad absorbed my entire identity just a couple of years earlier so I was a little unsure of where I stood\nBut [laughter]\nTo be honest but [laughter]\nI started to play and I was the one thing I was sure it was the value of the play that I was putting down was not very high because I didn't have\nAccess to a large team bankrupt which is what you really need to make a reasonable amount of money a blackjack with a small amount of capital my personal money that I had I was burning something equivalent at least theoretically to minimum wage and the casinos actually got a little bit lucky so I\nI Want to be more than that and I was playing and then my friend or friend Todd flew out to Portland and I drove down to visit him and I stopped in this casino on the way to check it out as a new place had just opened a couple of months earlier\nAnd they happened to have a shuffle that was imperfect it was interesting it didn't sufficiently randomized the car so I sat down and I attacked the shuffle the first day I got there are lots of ... which is normal ... went to Portland, Oregon and saw taught him you know we ordered the route of drinks and he said how are you doing what have you been up to you\nAnd I said well you know I Am good yeah a little this little that have been playing a little bit of blackjack and I could tell this question it was sort of forming\nA in his in his mind and he he he he was wondering I knew he was wondering you know ... Black Jack how like what does this mean ... contact with a chain with other people are you on your way and so I just preempted the entire thing and I said you know on my own my own bank roll my own money just a little bit of play and she was silent\nAnd I felt so angry at him\nAnd threw him at everybody else who he was representing all my friends the people who loved me my mom in that these all these people who I was you know I basically been keeping a pretty quiet it was playing a little cards on the side and the thing is that there is a dark side and a light side in gamp\nAnd I had thoroughly explored both sides\nI knew the difference\nBut the difficult thing about advantage game they're gambling with an edge is that this this situations that emerge when you're doing that and the search circumstances that come up and the stories that you come back with are so far out an extravagant and frankly incredible that if you admit\nTo any more ability or any uncertainty about what it is that you are doing\nIn a casino nobody will believe you\nThat you have an edge they won't see you as this thing that you are representing yourself as they will see you as the stone cold opposite of that\nAnd so I didn't talk about it more I ordered the next round we drank\nThe next day I was hung over back in the casino and the shuffle as I say it was not random it's what you call a sequential shuffle and in a sequence of all shuffled everything you see comes back to you again it's essentially a shuffle where it is possible to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact moment\nA specific individual cards are going to appear that's a little bit different from ordinary card counting it's very cool and this game had an additional feature was which is that besides just being ordinary blackjack game they had assigned bet attached to the blackjack game called the lucky lady\nAnd the lucky lady side beg and placed it right next year blackjack and if you were dealt\nA queen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts that would pay off at a hundred to ... and when I saw it I knew immediately this makes sense what you want to do in this game is to sequence the leading secrets the queen's hearts there are only six of them and the death but they're very very valuable and so for the previous day and a half\nI'd been a betting for queens of hearts and I caught a few but they didn't nothing ever lined up in his way to win the jackpot but I was ... that was covered I had a significant edge\nDoing this and suddenly at this moment the man next to me it was actually dealt the hand of hands screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and what that means is that there's a good likelihood that those two cards are going to appear within reasonable proximity of each other again\nAfter the chef and so I sequence that I've burned\nAn image into my head sequencing is in the ... technique and use visual monitor you associate people from your life with each card and put them in a scene to remember the order and so I burn this image and as the either was shuffling I was alone at the small casino in a remote place but\nI wasn't entirely alone because in front of me in my mind where these images of the people that I use when sequencing and they were all my old blackjack college so I saw these prosperous ...\nA kind of brilliant people that I always held in such a floating passed me and I also I was not alone in a literal sense because next to me at the table was this other guy who'd been in the casino all morning this was a Wednesday morning for hours gambling and he had that same glaze look that the people I used\nTo sit across the table from a gamblers anonymous meetings\nAnd the dealer finished shuffling and started to deal and I saw the cars come out that indicated the queen's we're in theory do and I placed\nTo best table maximum at this place it was three hundred dollars on two consecutive lucky lady squares and sure enough for the first round one queen of heart was dealt on one of my bats which had happened a number of times before I'd never won anything from it so I didn't get too excited\nThe dealer kept going around and on the second round on top of my queen of hearts she put another queen of hearts and then she stops\nAnd she looked at the table and she called over the boss and he came and she looked at the table and\nWould they eventually figure it out with something I already knew which is that a hundred times a three hundred dollar wager pays thirty thousand dollars and around the time they figured that out I absorbed the notion that I had in fact just one\nThat amount and in fact in the turn of a single card on one hand had gone within crying ...\nOf his fifty thousand dollar not I was trying to recover\nEventually\nSomewhat but grudgingly\nThey paid the Kashmir\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had\nIn that casinos a small place I also took every fifty dollar bill [laughter]\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nAnd I took this wide and just stuffed it down my pants so that I was physically ... expanded in\nThis weird for cheaper and way sort of like in the old days but I turned around and I wasn't in Las Vegas I was in this ... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino people who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and it seemed me at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ...\nAnd a briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you terms and sure I wasn't being followed and then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest so [laughter]\nWas the first punishment then the second punishment was I was sent to live with my mother's this to\nMy aunt um\nI didn't like my brother they said and uh I was\nUh uh put on a boat with my little release with my little things in it um I was put on a boat it so happened to be the very boat on which the angry letters went back and forth and uh just quite possible that I was a letter myself [noise]\nI ... when I arrived in Dominique ... I'm a Dominique incidentally is named uh because Christopher Columbus discovered it on a Sunday so its name Dominique ... he had by that time run out of\nNames he likes that [noise]\nIn any case when I go to this island it was very strange my mother had told me about her growing up you know various um things but I thought that the only ... these things only happen to my mother of the uh\nCarrying a sneak on knowing me to her on her head for many miles these sort of thing would only have ... uh to my mother or her description of fish that flew in or out of the water this would only happen to her\nBut it turns out that Dominique it was just as she described it and um which is why she fled from it it rained [noise]\nIt rained all the time uh the beaches had no sign did they have ... black hair bows because the island is volcanic formed from an old volcano\nUm and uh the skies were not great there was water everywhere whereas anti ... as you well know because you've been there on your holiday and it never rains it has beautiful beaches I'm a ... seat and and especially blue sky [noise]\nAnd uh so Domenico was the opposite of this place that I had just been banished from 'em and worst my aunt was in there to meet me on the on the on the Jackie uh somehow I was taken to her house and where my grandparents also lived in Moscow Domenico\nAnd there I met my aunt who was the complete opposite of my mother for one thing she had read here and great eyes and that's when I first came to realize that my mother was something called a Richards and um they have that\nMark read here in gray eyes\nAnd also my on seemed incredibly cost me she didn't have my mother\nGraceful ways my mother incidentally had long black hair she took off to the ... side of her ... her family\nAnd um she was very graceful and very um even though we were very pool where she had very bourgeois ways we ate within napkins and knife and fork and and spoke properly insulin my aunt was the opposite of that\nAnd I'm I'm naturally you know missed my mother very much and I'm couldn't understand my management\nAh I began to write to my mother things that were not true I Would say that my aunt had mistreated me um had denied me food ah had um made me go without sleep all sorts of things that were not true ah\nAnd then I Would food the letters up and take them to be with me out of the yard on my way to school um which was five miles away from my house in a village called ...\n... really massacre but does that has a whole other starring which I'll save for another time in any case I Would put the letters under the stove and ah just outside the gate I never posted them I had no way of posting them\nAnd they were all at the same you know Jim mommy I miss you so much and I'm very badly treated they give me new food they treat me like a dog all of it completely untrue um but then I Would food them up and put them a\nOnto the stone and then walk off to school\nA parent be one day my aunt saw me do this I'm without my nose she saw me secrete these uh pieces of paper on Doris do and\nAnd uh she let me go off to school but she retrieve them and uh when I returned that afternoon from school or the letters were on a table and ah there was this red haired degree either woman in flames are\nAt me angry at me and um I think I cried and said I was sorry and so on a bus in any case it didn't matter\nUh she packed up my things and the next time the boat to a arrived it was called the envy rip and the next time it arrived she put me on it and sent me back to my mother\nWhich is just what I wanted I wanted to go back to\nAh my mother and so I arrived in Ninety ... and are waiting for me at all on the pier was ah\nAh my mother and ah I was very happy to see her\nExcept that yes she had another child [noise]\nAnd so even though my letters had gotten me back ah to my mother's side in every way I was further away from her\nThan before\nThank you\nThat for hours\nHe's short fiction
