{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "And subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states I'm the president cannot change that by himself now\nYou know some folks on the subject to the jurisdiction riles language rights but the Supreme Court in Ninety eight um expressly held that that does not mean if you're off it just means that you are you're not in a diplomatic I ...\nI Know which case you referring to when I was rereading that case today and I noticed that in that case it involved or the child of a of of a legal residents not to people who were here uh without ... residency documents\nSo that that's true I mean into the race was called the United states versus ... and it's definitely true that that case involved um you know individuals who had lawfully emigrated but the Supreme Court analysis of the texture the fourteenth amendment\nDid not turn on the fact that they were here lawfully it turned on\nThe conclusion that the language and the citizenship clause that says you have to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nIs not meant to distinguish lawful presence from on lawful presence adoption to distinguish those are are in their own capacity and those who are here solely on some kind of foreign diplomatic represented representational\nNow that's that's an interesting thing because a lot of people go back to the initial language why this birthright citizenship exist at all and perhaps we should touch on that to this came in the wake of the civil war and it had to do with Friedman right\nIt did I mean the Supreme Court famously infamously I'm In the Dred Scott decision Eighteen fifty sat had held that slaves were not citizens for purposes of the federal constitution and of course that's you know one of the court more\nInfamous more vilified Simpsons history right part of the purpose of the citizenship clause the very first sentence of the fourteenth amendment\nWas to overrule Dred Scott and wants to make it clear that no matter what your history no matter what your lineage even if you had grown up in bondage in a state that for did you like property you're still a citizen and you were a citizen by dint of the fact that you were born here\nYou know this was made in the context of an interview right I mean this is not a formal proposal to our knowledge there hasn't been anything that the executive branch shooting each step that the executive branch has formally taken to try to rescind this but let's just play this out I mean even\nIf you assume that this is about politics and about a ... an election season and tried to drum up support on the right\nUm you know why shouldn't the president and given the fact that this has come up time and time again these questions about what this means why not uh go ahead and uh and and make such a move since you know that this is going to be challenged in court and test this once and for all\nSee I mean I guess my reaction is if you really believe what you're saying and they're not just doing\nThe constitution provides avenues for pursuing were foreign competition provides an express roadmap for you know changing\nThe meaning of the citizenship clause and so I think you know it'd be a lot more convincing\nIf instead of saying he's going to do this by executive order the president actually hook the you know legally appropriate step of proposing a constitutional amendment that would change the language of sex and one of the ... amendment I'm you know the reality might be that such an amendment would actually get through\nThe house in the Senate but perhaps not be ratified by the requisite thirty states but that's the way the process is supposed to work\nStephen Vladeck is professor of law at the University of Texas school of law professor thanks so much for taking a few minutes out to talk with us\nThank you and you are listening to the Texas standard\n[noise]\nBorder border border yeah it's a it's top story right now I'm Will stone by social media editor here at the standard what are Texans talking about\nDefinitely more following up on what we just heard gifts Trump saying he would end of the concept of birthright citizenship by executive order sure sparking a lot of pushback on line on our Facebook page Bobby flood says how sad that some Americans will just trashed the fourteenth amendment and cheer for Trump's actions\nIf Trump believes he can take away birthright what other rights do you think he believes he can executive order away\nInteresting perspective there meanwhile on Twitter Genevieve\nA echoes something that I've seen a lot of out there as well David a seems to me this conversation is a way for all of us to stop talking about the eleven dead synagogue attendees the largest assassination attempt in us history referring there to all the bombs sent through the mail and another racist a melting down black people referring there to that shooting\nVote in every race vote in every election Genevieve says so some people sort of see this as a distraction if you will another listener see something similar it's inseparable from the mid term Joel says that Trump is in spaghetti mode\nThrowing everything has to want to see what sticks and get his die hards\nOut to the polls and he does have supporters you know this concept of a ending birthright citizenship isn't exactly like a fringe thing on the Republican side it's got many supporters I Believe Ted Cruz\nAs brave a previously voiced his support of ending a birthright citizenship one of them winning US Marshal wolf she says that no one should receive automatic citizenship but the mother cross the border just to give birth of the parents aren't in green card mode there shouldn't be any automatic citizenship [noise]\nYou know every few years it seems like this issue of birthright citizenship flares as one commentator said briefly but brightly a and we see a lot of news articles and I don't think we've heard the last of this conversation even if the president doesn't move forward I think we're going to see a lot more commentary built around this ah this idea\nDecidedly selling one last interesting perspective here from Leah Keith on her Facebook page she notes that the president may not be thinking about the thousands of service members serving overseas that this could affect birthright citizenship citizenship works both ways not only for those people born here but also for those born to us or citizen serving\nAround the world interesting per se but yeah there is\nYeah you know it's interesting a there's a group I'm a ... that does come migration policy they they ah they publish a I Believe this is the migration Policy Institute indeed it is\nAnd they have said that if in fact we were to get rid of a of of this uh uh a birthright citizenship a section in the fourteenth amendment what\nShe would be looking at is a basically the unauthorized population ballooning to twenty four million in twenty fifty from the eleventh\nSo again today on all things kept equal now so it's interesting stuff bender again I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about it definitely well shifting gears about a hundred and eighty degrees we all know that Halloween is almost here so it shouldn't be surprising to learn on a much lighter note that today is national candy corn day\nAt a very an already question Wendy candy corn become so controversial it just seems Deborah gr at a trash these sugary colonel certain circles which really embolden the candy corn supporters an apologist I'm\nThere so I'm kind of go either way quite honestly but I'm trying to get to the bottom of it we have a Twitter ... where you stand on the controversial section has right now have present don't eat it\nTried to forty two percent if the vet vote you know where do you think Texas to get to the Texas standards you pick out a ... oh yeah\nThis is where we're going to have to keep that for tomorrow we're out of time for the big broadcast hope you can join us again\nOn Wednesday till then have a terrific to\nWash their hands\nAnd we may not fit in grant aid you intend

that your show and you were on the big ... you don't do God I tiny picture on a little extra and today I Want to ask you a big picture here shows been on almost\nAs we sit here to the day eight years really yeah soon as to me all most of the day and in that time a lot about the world is changed meanings change technology changed the competitive set has changed but really what's changed in the news and I bet that when you started the show and twenty ten\nFive seconds later I mean we're sitting here less than a week after Rod Rosenstein went to the White House and we all understood that he was going to be fired which in turn would have put Noel Francisco this solicitor general or somebody else\nIn that job overseeing Muller who could have been been fired the funded the entire mother investigation and therefore the Trump presidency would have been seriously impacted and we went in there and she usually impacted [noise] and because of the cabinet stuff Rosenstein went gone much sacrifice we we we were talking about that in the old days with the ... days\nFor two weeks right I can give you so many examples of stories or a ... we don't do because of this from I remember Manafort well remember [noise]\nHow about how about you know this year there's been a very interesting I hear\nSenate race in Texas\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] I\nDon't think I've said a word about it but here's what I have so many a day I I have walked in to the office and I said so uh so we're going to do a ... a race we're going to do the Aurora cruise tonight to do and and\nYou know the gene would look at us and who do with each other and then they go um\nMaybe you know and this is this is at four o'clock arrived and I go I don't think so because it's already getting overwhelmed and I really want to do it I used to work in the United States Senate I knew and worked with the last elected democratic senator from Texas lord\n... have a I have a I have more than a real interested in this and it's what I wanted to see and talk about on TV and we can and you can't we can't do it says it gets sorted rules by\nYou know this this other stuff to that point about working for a ... in Congress you worked for ... for sending a morning in New York bureau chief of staff and the Senate Foreign fire Finance Committee you you you really have a grounding and a lot of the stuff that you are now presiding over a little\nBit like cheating if you if you Ankara cable news show and you've actually wind\nYou know science yeah if you know so that's the way that they're not you know you're supposed\nTo but it is that that that's really a great aspect of your show because you're you bring the receipts every night you actually have been in the middle\nOf these procedural process back of house if we're talking about the capital here and just to pick one exam and it's all about how the Senate functions now the Senate used to function of how this is somehow they've you know they broke the rules of the traditions or ...\nYou actually know it [noise] yeah and um and I really and boy I Can't imagine trying to do this kind of show without the base because it gives me\nThere's a there's just a there's hundreds and hundreds of hours or over the years over ... years hundreds of hours of preparation that I have not had to do more for the show right you know 'cause I Know what it is you know and uh and I hear Chuck Grassley mentioning the two hour rule and we're hearing and I know what it is and nobody\nNobody else that Israel or you don't have to now it's not a ... yeah I Do you need it right era you know\nAnd and and that's a and so I I I I Can't imagine a cloud of of ignorance and you know I remember the giant cloud of ignorance that I Lived in before I went to work in the Senate [noise] uh you know I grew up ah Irish Catholic in Boston for and so for example\nI didn't know which direction to go to try to find a Republican like I don't know I guess you might go to western Massachusetts or so I have no idea [laughter] so and I certainly didn't run into any Republicans in college\nAnd so I think really literally the first Republicans I ever knew to talk to\nMore Republican senators [laughter] so [noise]\nSo imagine the the fog of both political thinking and policy I knew next to nothing about policy a guy new Medicare and Medicaid had something to do with health but I wasn't sure which was which you know you know [noise] and so [laughter]\nSo I I I have a you know that this enormous uh education you know that that I got a a ... and and I just can't imagine doing this or without it\nI didn't write what a great day well pad wine and say about this and you know that's the one question\nThat I'm never able to answer because ... was a a a towering intellect he was a Harvard professor who then went into the Senate after serving as United Nations ambassador and\nHaving been in the cabinet in sub cabinet of of four presidents JFK LBJ [noise]\nAh Richard Nixon Ford in that order or serve them all a an an every day in his presence was like a one on one Harvard graduate seminar and I was learning every second that I wasn't speaking and he was and when\nI lost that and when he died I I just had\nI lost it was like losing a part of my brain I I've I realize so\nStrongly and vividly how dependent my thinking was on his and my thinking without his is a is just a pale shadow of his and so there's not a single\nQuestion I felt comfortable\nWith a since he's been gone a involving what would send them on and say now I Would say something that I haven't thought of right and I would be so thrilled to hear\nYou you know the Saturday morning then comes up a lot these days because of the world we live in regarding facts\nIn the absence of commonly agree on set of facts at that and then I'm going to paraphrase I Hope I get it right the ... the the one hand quote that comes up almost every single day now is\nEveryone's entitled to their own opinions but they're not entitled to their own facts he ought to perfectly I did okay [laughter] but then the um that is really the frame around almost everything these days yeah we had gone into a mode where\nFacts are not commonly agreed on and therefore there can be no coming together there can be no common purpose\nBut they don't agree on the basic foundation necessary\nTo do that at least he wouldn't be looking at this was arm and and amused by\nThe end that now famous quote of his is something he would say either in committee or on the Senate for maybe once or\nTwice at most a year okay now they have you know it would be it would be the preface to every single thing like I said right and so and so that that that's an important a point that it it became\nKind of a famous quote because not to the Senate every day but as you said it's so rarely and when he said it it was really important moment people went oh yeah okay way than we've we we we are going too far and as I read a short time with him you know when ... when he when he's on\nThat say you're Nineteen sixty eight fascinating to me is Mitch McConnell in those days was one of the most reasonable Republican senators we had to deal with on the other side Orrin Hatch very reasonable Republican senator who is on the Finance Committee\nWith U.S foreign ... served on that committee with Lloyd Bentsen is German with one hand as chairman Chuck Grassley same thing [noise]\nUh we really like to these guys and it didn't mean they were voting with us they mostly we're not\nUh but they were very reasonable participants in everything we were trying to do including by the way the things that they were going to vote against they would still quietly in the back room or make reasonable ingestion about those things that you know so it it's stunning to me to watch\nHow those individuals that\nHave changed I don't know who they are now and I once I I could then you actually didn't have like ... you know and I and I and I had enormous respect and affection for Orrin Hatch\nA Chuck Grassley has always been cranky it's just what is now he's ... he's actually he's it it's it's one of those things to Chuck Grassley has no idea what he sounds like\nAnd so he he is never asked cranky as he sounds that's the key so whenever you hear it just dial down on your head and that's where he\nIs yeah you're you're Nineteen so we have a few minutes left you're Nineteen sixty book is about to come out and pay back and I want to commend it to everybody's attention but I really want to look back at your book deadly force yes\nWhich was published I Believe in Nineteen Seventy five or eighty four eighty ... eighty four yeah the case that involves was he was a case from the Nineteen Seventy five nights I vote for a day for\nYou just done a new edition of this was out this last year and it's about a they use of force by white police against an unarmed black\nCitizens yeah this was the I was the I guess ... having to take\nOn this subject the very first thing I ever wrote was an op ed piece in the New York times in Nineteen Seventy nine about police use of deadly force and that was the first time that the New York times treated the subject of police use deadly force them and their knowledge that there was a serious problem\nSo the story that I told my book is of an individual case in Boston where my father who was a Boston cop\nA and then put himself through law school nights\nEnded up taking this civil rights case of a black man who was killed by the Boston police and my father got himself into a multi year war with his old police department and improved a that this was a bad killing and won a judgment against the police department and in those days no one cared about this I Can't tell you how much\nOf what a what a silent universe it was surrounding all of this\nAnd when my book came out in the middle of the Nineteen eighties it got a little bit of attention very briefly", "show_name":
