{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "A business as usual with trying to um as you noted earlier the there's been a long time policy of what might be sort of summarized as constructive engagement predicated on the idea that when the United states and trying to work together even when we have differences working together actually advances the interests of both countries in ways that are\nGood for both countries and I think the vice president in his speech essentially signaled in to that mindset and a much more\nAdversarial framing of the relationship in which there is much more of a kind of a zero sum a dynamic at play where if China is gaining we're losing and conversely if the United states is gaining a China loses and I think that mindset is now the mindset of this administration and it does represent a very significant departure\nAt least rhetorically and I think to some large degree substantively as well from a past the U.S approaches to China on both sides of the part of ...\nWell now I have to ask because if the past is any indication of vice presidential speech joined U.S policy toward China would be better than ... to anticipate an even calculate Chinese reaction I mean he he surely would have known that the Hudson Institute was in his only audience hear what was he trying to do with his speech\nWell I think the vice president on behalf of the administration and certainly with the full backing of the president without question and indeed vice president Pence cited President Trump ... repeatedly and his comments um it clearly was sending a signal first and foremost to ah to try them\nIn a sense I think the vice president's speech was really an effort to kind of served notice to China that we are entering from an American standpoint from the administration standing wins specifically a very different kind of error and how if you're trying to\nYou know in recent days there was this incident in which the Chinese naval vessel nearly collided with a U.S destroyer knew this Bradley islands and this is an example of what the vice president has called reckless or a Harris men have us ships patrolling international waters but we've seen other run ins with a with a U.S or a military planes is well\nHow where do you see this ultimately going are we looking at a new Cold War\nIt depends on what the meaning of Cold War is but I the way I interpret the speech\nAnd the overall approach the administration is not so much that I'm the dynamics on the Chinese side or Chinese behaviors are much different than what they have been in recent years\nWhat is different is the way that the United states administration is looking at those behaviors and what is also different is the way that the United states is speaking about those behaviors and we clearly have a president who has a very unconventional style\nOf communication we have an administration that in a sense obviously follows the president's cue as as the leader of our nation and so we have a way of talking about problems that exist to three or four or five years ago or two years ago\nIn a way that's very different than how the United states under either democratic or Republican presidents spoke about the very same problems and so part of it is tone on rhetorical but also it suggests that there's a kind of a a a ... a a sense that the United states has reached\nThe threshold of its forbearance with respect to\nCertain types of Chinese behaviors that are seen as very problematic from the standpoint of U.S interests\nDavid Firestein is a

personnel as part of Texas task force wanting to help with rescue so\nCentral yeah several local first responders have been dispatched or you know emergency rescue teams like the ones you just mentioned a dangerous situation to be shared although\nFortunately no reports this fire of anyone being injured or killed\nThe reason for this flooding illustrated in a tweet by the Austin San Antonio National Weather service that says here's an estimated rainfall graphics in the past few days the near record flooding of Atlanta river Atlanta can be contributed to an estimated eight to ten inches in the past forty eight hours over the river basin\nObviously the advice from the experts is to seek higher ground if you're near the river and if you're not near it keep it that way\nOn Twitter Robin he also counsels if you're on the Leno marble falls flood area please check on disabled neighbors they may need help getting to evacuation shelters please help them get out sooner rather than later

I write a whole chapter to the special attorney John McCain and I are together and they have the right who did\nComing together where you are not once ... allies\nIraq but we we um but it it it's really a story of the old set up that I have a chapter and they're about ... where we used to you know we used to go out to dinner together\nRepublican Democrat lite we could sit there and sharing glass of wine and talk about family a laugh do with each other\nAnd and come back the next morning something out of that dinner could produce an amendment or could produce progress doesn't happen anymore or there's ... there's almost an attitude that frowns on the notion of indoor caucus dialogue and people working together there are people there and want to work together\nBut there's something that has changed and I saw it began to change in Nineteen Ninety four partly with the Gingrich\nRevolution and contract with America\nContract with America Tea Party to the thing that you know basically here's what's happened I don't think it's very complicated understand most Americans are angry\nOn the right on the left and in the center and the reason they're angry as they see Washington not working\nThey see their lives not necessarily improving at the rate that they thought they would or should people working two jobs some people working three jobs trying to make ends meet a price of college going out of the you know you you come out of college with extraordinary debt\nAh and and so globalization is terrifying people people feel as if we're carrying the burden for a lot of countries who aren't paying in Donald Trump's appealing to that and talking about that and that's fine but you've got to work with people you can't separate everybody you can't separate yourself in today's world I give you an example\nWe uh\nWe um we're told that a million people were going to die in West Africa and four months\nAnd ... from Ebola and we said no we're not going to ... we can't let that happen so President Obama had the courage to send three thousand plus troops over in West Africa we work with the British and the French we each took the country and guess what\nWe stopped Ebola in its tracks Amir fraction of those of that production died of\nAids were on the brink of the first generation of children being born age free in Africa and that's because a PEPFAR in American program was George W.\nBush was in ... Lee and help to to make happen bipartisan so we're so how do you get it back to the big question always people seemed to acknowledge that the system is broken and people seem to further acknowledge that a\n... right now we're not going to get anything done unless we come together I tell ya you walk up to the edge of giving us loser here saying that\nYou get it back by making the democracy workers all was taken individual people are willing to go out and do the work and make an issue that you care about voting issue\nIn Nineteen Seventy when I first came back from Vietnam I didn't first protest the war I first became involved in Earth Day and I did Seventy we brought twenty million Americans out of their homes\nThey were saying you know inspired by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring\nWe don't want a toxic waste site and our back yard we don't want air that makes us sick we don't want to get cancer from water that were drinking and and so that movement translate into political motive and they've targeted the twelve worst votes in the United States Congress yes what happened in the next election seven of the twelve lost their seats\nAnd then the flood the dam broke the [noise] we we have the the uh clean Air Act passed the safe drinking water past the marine mammal protection coastal zone management\nAnd we ate PA was created Richard Nixon signed eat the a into existence which came out of this grassroots movement right that's what I in this book I I come I'm totally optimistic about the future I Believe this young group that's running today\nIs is part of the solution why\nBecause it's not the rules of Washington that have changed it's not the institution and the structure that has changed\nIt's the people the people who say my way or the highway the people to come with an ideological orthodoxy that ignores some of the fundamental values of the country and how we got we have to have unity again in this\nCountry to change Congress is going to change congressman Jay emailing change change the members of Congress and you bring people in\nRight who reflect the anxieties and in hopes and aspirations of the people who send them there and who are willing to act on it what's happened today I regret to say you know is you've got people there who are more\nLoyal to power to party to president than they are in upholding their oath to uphold the constitution of the country and protect the institutions of our nation\nRecently very critical of President Trump on the bill Maher program you compared the president to a teenage girl temper mentally\nKnow I compare them to having been an immature eight year old boy will you compared with eight year old I compare them to and immature eight year old boy and having raised two fabulously a strong young women when my daughter's right I'm familiar with what teenage years were like right now that said\nUh that are putting lipstick on what you said All right [laughter]\nYou know if I compared the president to to a right to the combination of the two\nRight because but the point I was trying to make is Seventy two year old president shouldn't be behaving like a child and we shouldn't be in a situation where and and I obviously I I I've left you know that's retired as a comparison\nFully retired because leaves the gender out just say an immature right you know the eight year old child in a teenage\nSays the picture painted by Bob Woodward the picture painted by the anonymous op ed writer in the New York times the stories that we've heard about the dysfunction in this administration and the president's own behavior\nYou buy the legitimacy the credibility laws ability of that ... let me just say this look I'm I've been at this longtime Twenty years in the Senate for drivers as secretary of state it's a great privilege\nKnow the currents of what happens in Washington yeah people are saying I have friends in the Senate Republicans who I still talk to me and I went out and visited with John McCain and Arizona you know two months six weeks before he passed right yeah and we talked about it right very candidly um and the truth is\nThe truth is everybody in Washington is talking about it has been for a year and a half yeah and what Michael Wolff wrote fire and fury back in ... what has now been written by Woodward\nI'm at is spoken about in the halls of Congress by many of the people of his party and others that's why I find it so difficult to swallow the fact that people\nGloss over it publicly because it's ... yeah and it is affecting our nation in a very significant way we can't establish a baseline of facts\nIn our country right when the paper of record like the Washington Post\nTallies all the untruths I'll call them that yeah over the course of a year and a half and comes up with five thousand that's where we are yeah something's wrong\nAnd that means the secretary of the counter to that is that the people who supported this president did let except that he has a low ceiling he has a high floor\nHis basis with the people elected this president elected him despite that okay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Overheard with Evan Smith", "city": "Austin", "day": "17"}
