I'm Talking about I think\nThey will take a look at it and I think it's it's a it'll be interesting to see how they deal with it because you know there has been a push a I think going back to two thousand seven uh really driven by Democrats\nIn the legislature to try to to create a statewide a tobacco Twenty one law and I think gradually a few Republicans have come on board over the years but the you know we still haven't really seen anything happened\nAt the state level and so I think that you you probably have some conflicting uh interest you're you have some people the legislature thinks the time is right for the state to take action on it and then you'll have some who say um who wants to reverse what we're seeing in San Antonio\nGarcia is a metro columnist for the San Antonio express news willing to his latest to Texas standard ...

I'm not\n... but we routinely mock do you notice standby because ... ... there's\nThere's two issues here and I am very clear in the book that I Would love a day or you know do over on that day I did not we did not effectively communicate well we want it to how to do it\nTake responsibility for that right okay that being said the goal was to talk about um it's just take the focus off the number of people on the mall and say OK here are all these people who are watching it in some way shape or form or the interest in the enthusiasm existed here's why I Know that\nTwitter had the largest uh that was the largest lives something that they'd ever done for the platform simply didn't exist eight years prior so it wasn't a political statement about this president versus\nThe platforms that which people watch it with her Facebook Live Snapchat Twitter\nUm didn't exist eight years prior in terms of being able to watch live programming in that ... correct so it's it's literally a furnished safe statement when you say these platforms didn't exist prior to that right so if you can add up I mean it's it's sort of like\nYou know in the Eighteen hundreds people couldn't have watch television therefore the audience\nTV audience is bigger couldn't get by nature of the fact that the the technology and the platforms didn't exist prior\nLet me when it comes to the point you made earlier more broadly about the job of the White House if I Can't do this but\nI I think that you know looking back and not dwelling on\nWhat I should have done is really focused on making that case a lot better and frankly minimizing it and saying look this is ridiculous that we're having this conversation was talking about let's talk about the yeah I mean but I like I said and I I talked about extensively in the book in terms of what how we came to that is just so that it wasn't\nIt was mangled there's no other way to say it um and and I I you know you asked the president earlier he was human when I was done\nYou know that the way you handle that are fuming that people believed what they believe\nKnow how I handled it I mean I and and I think that's got to go off on the wrong foot within oh I yeah and I think a lot of other people other people there and you know funny I I I'm\n... I'm In Texas I can say this but you know I I I got a call off which my wife and she said you know just thinking of you and that was to me like the southern equivalent to bless your heart hurts\nYour [laughter] thoughts and prayers life it was like you're not even saying that you did a good job you know I'm thinking if you're talking\nAbout the job of the White House press secretary broadly you alluded to earlier what is the job is the jump to brief the media is the jump to brief the public is the job to carry the president's water politically too who are you holding and for whom do you work in that job you work for the American people right um\nYou ... at the pleasure of the president right I'm In your job is to communicate the thoughts and views of the president administration\nIs your job to tell the truth yes do you believe you always told the truth yes you'd never lied once in a job now could you possibly told us things that you believe to be true at the time\nGoing through and look there's a difference between knowingly lie making mistakes which I've I've been very clear on it and several instances where I screwed up and you know there is a difference between intentionally misleading somebody um and spinning and sort of going out and saying I Want to put the best case I can on\nThat is what I've done my entire career has gone out and said okay this is why this candidate why this institution is is gonna win or why they're I mean right but that's the job the PR person so um I think that's vastly different than going out and in lying\nI'm so did I put the down as a conscious\nThan deliberate act around too much and you put your best you put the ... and but you put the best face\nOn the news for the person who work for the\nPresident more literal or in some cases if someone says what does he believe or what are his thoughts are her thoughts right and you say they believe the following\nIt's not your job to go out and say you know\nLook they believe this but I don't think that's true I mean your tenure is probably about four minutes then if that's the case right I mean you're so your job is to articulate the views and thoughts of the principle that you work for\nAnd it's very different than going out there and saying this is one of the frustrations that I had a lot of times like when they said well what do you think that's a you know I wasn't elected that wasn't my job as your irrelevant what you are correct and it I mean I've worked for\nFifteen a government and elected officials over my tenure and I've never agreed with any of the hundred percent I mean that's that's not going to ever happen um your job though is to go out and articulate their views and thought in a way that you've given them the best advice and council you can't privately and then come to an agreed upon\nUm you know message that they want\nYou know that ... that the the knock on Sarah Sanders your successor is that she doesn't always tell the truth from the podium do you believe he tells the truth all the time\nIt's a it's a very difficult question to answer and the satellite I wasn't gonna answer it because because I everything I mean there's nothing that I Know when she gets up and says that's knowingly false that's I don't you know parts everywhere says but I Know where to be an honest person that's what I Do I Do not believe that she's ever gets up in lives\nRight what what's the relationship that the White House should have with the people in the room with the press should it be a good relationship and is it a good relationship\nUm I don't I think that that\nFiguring out what the relationship is is less important in the sense that their job is to communicate issues announcements policies of the White House the president and the government um and if that relationship is good that's great but I don't think that the focus should be on the relationship is much is doing the job\nWell but they're not ... and I think sometimes some people in that room\nOr are said to be too aggressive or they're said to have an agenda that what the people in the White House staff generally speaking with like is for Sarah or you or whoever Jay Carney\nTo get up say what the position of the president is have everybody due to flee write it down and then have that show up on the air or in the paper that would be quite a bit but it wouldn't be nice but there's quite a bit more attention these days more attention than ever\nSo I don't think that I Do that's absolutely right you know I I agree wholeheartedly right but I I write in the book and I named reporters named I think do a good\nJob in one Maggie have I'm In New York times really judge Jacob split the president share your point of view about Maggie probably not always [laughter] you know I think eight dollars or a rate Steve Holland's Reuters John Roberts fight I mean there are a lot of good ones and you you can imagine some of these folks have written things that\nI don't agree with with Ruy are tough tenacious but fair in professional and that was different I think reporters should ask any questions that they want right that's their job but what the difference in where I think the issue that I have now is is the ethics and the behavior have gotten out of line I think that you should be able to ask whatever you want\nYou should eat the exchange me but it is it is gone beyond that now you've got people jumping up and down\nDemanding that they called on and you weren't as grandstand absolutely some not all is the president correct when he talks about fake news when he talks about the press as despicable all the things that we now know to to a fairly well for months and months and months he's\nBeen saying is he correct when he suggests news organizations are making things up that stuff he doesn't like Meg ... and others people your name fake", "show_name": "Overheard with Evan Smith", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "03"}
