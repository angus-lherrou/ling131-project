Burt Reynolds foundation Claire and Carl Stewart and by Entergy\nI'm Evan Smith he's a hard charging lawyer and cable television mainstay who has president Donald Trump in his sights now he's considering a run for the White House himself in twenty twenty he's Michael ... this is over\nFall in other nations\nTo say that he made his own bed cause him to sleep and then I\nAs to the legitimacy of this president and also as it relates to this particular a nominee or the ability to appoint the nominee to take Justice Kennedy's\nSpot so I I'm a firm believer that that has to be seriously considered and I'll tell you why do\nThe Supreme Court as the composition is likely to exist and in fact people talk to me about twenty twenty let me just say this if Donald Trump wins again and twenty twenty the U.S Supreme Court will go to seven to two now that is a\nFeeling that either Ginsburg were Brier one of them goes while I\nI don't think it's likely that between now and twenty twenty four okay now I again I think a roof fate or\nIs phenomena gonna outlive all\nShe I Hope so man from your lips to God's Ears I Hope she outlived apparently made us the however\nI mean now in twenty twenty four I think there's a high likelihood that there will be two additional seats that are going to come open and I also believe that if Donald Trump is re elected in twenty twenty Clarence Thomas likely steps down between twenty twenty and twenty twenty four\nYear replacement somebody who didn't serve for thirty five for another thirty but let's just assume Thomas stays on the court the court's gonna go seven to two\nNow a lot of people know about roe v Wade and Citizens United and brown v board of education and maybe one or two other decisions but what people don't have an appreciation for days\nThere was another ten or twelve or Thirteen decision to come down from the U.S Supreme Court every year that have dramatic impacts on people's ability to seek justice in our jury system right I'm seek justice for uh being discriminated against\nA whole host of issues now if the court goes to seven to two you're talking about ushering in change in the United states that we have not seen in our lifetime and in fact you're talking about change for thirty to forty years\nAmerica will change dramatically for thirty to forty years the likely the balance in my lifetime and the next thirty to forty years and my children's lifetime it's a big deal\nSo you can make the same argument and do it because it made for many years and election time elections have consequences those consequences come in the form of judicial appointments that most people don't give thought to but they have a much longer tail in terms of their effect into politics and without a doubt right how did you come to be ... next attorney\nShe reached out to me she reached out to you first yeah absolutely you know this is another thing that a bit a and I'm I'm curious about this because a lot of people have started asking me this question and then I find it bizarre in the last six months over\nThree thousand inquiries had been made to my office for me to get involved in various people's cases on a whole host of things ... effect well I I certainly I think that has a huge impact no question\nI have an excessive the representation of Stormy Daniels has brought people together\nThere's no question now there's been inquiries like the CIA has installed the chip\nIn the back of my head and I want to say the CIA people out I mean that that's the Enquirer that fathers probably about a hundred of those like I put those right so you put those to the side we don't have to do a lot of betting on those maybe we should All right now I mean we're missing some big case\nBut um there's been over three thousand inquiries we've gotten involved and very few of those cases yeah and a miss sweating it was one of those inquiries contacted my office asked for represent\nYou take them all seriously or most of them seriously enough to discriminate 'cause obviously you had to sift through the the pile to get to ... sweating\n[noise] well I think that we take probably twenty five percent I write I'm initially seriously and maybe look I I'll bet you that there are some that slip through the cracks and maybe we should take seriously that that we don't\nBut once we reached that or once the client perspective client passes that initial hurdle me then then I went and vet the vet the potential case and let me say this as a relates to the sweat\nI built a reputation for almost Twenty years a building\nDollars and verdicts and start right trying cases all over the country Texas Florida and New York Arizona California big a class action a verdict in federal court last year four hundred and fifty for a million dollars largest in California third largest in the in the nation you know I'm not some porn star lawyer like many would like\nTo Tucker Carlson that's like he'd want our higher on his to call you a ... way and now are now Don and now Don\nJunior I mean ... got into the mix last night I had to remind Don junior that his dad was actually the one that had sex with my porn star client [noise]\n\nLast time I will ever be on PBS\nVery ma is that his dad was\nThe one that had sex with my ... started client with is four months old brother at home with his step mom and home at the same time I had to remind on junior of that okay but\nHe has a lot you know not yeah yeah yeah I'm a ... and I and I also\nTold him that the adults should probably handle this and\nHe says but in any event uh you know I'm not I I I'm not an attorney\nThen is routinely represented porn stars have represented one for starting in my life and I will tell you it's likely the last porn star that I Would represent right\nLife but it was a big one and I mean while she's an incredible woman again the government is really turning in many respects on your decision to represent these people have said that your ever tasted miss Daniels and the through line to Michael Cohen\nIs more of a threat to this administration this president and the ... well and I and and I think one of the management\nWhy I certainly would not have been married yeah and that's why you know people that say to me well\nYou know didn't you take the Stormy Daniels representation because you were looking at a career in politics and you're trying to set yourself up for twenty twenty I mean look my prediction rate's pretty good but it's not that good right I mean how could I possibly have anticipated that this case\nWould develop the way that it has in total and ultimately put me in this place relating to the national discussion which by the way\nYou know they say that the rate of descent\nIs usually three times the rate of ... which which scares the heck out of me because the rate of accent who's been rather steep\nUm but I but but every day every day I Am conscious at least a few times during the day that all of this could end tomorrow right and uh that my life could go back to what it was and that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing 'cause I've had a good life\nSo here I live in Texas I'm aware of your work on the families separated at the border story as well as all this stuff in the national headlines that's actually something that gets very little attention to the degree that the stormy Daniels' case murder the Kavanaugh case my so you're doing not just the cable TV ready\nUp presentations or productions you're also doing it sounds to me like through that roll up your sleeves legal you haven't stopped doing no I haven't stopped doing that right in fact that that effort\nOr the recent effort relating to separated children and and mothers and fathers and reuniting these kids with their parents has really been the most of the filling work I've done in my career more fulfilling\nThan to work that I've done for stormy who I have a great relationship with and it's been very fruitful at least from a from a PR standpoint read it has it has not been fruitful from a financial standpoint\nUm but what's been most fulfilling is the work that I've done at our southern border and in connection with reuniting these kids with their parents yeah which I'm a firm believer in a strong borders by the way to be clear and I do not believe we should eliminate ice I think we need to change the way that ice goes about enforcing the policies\nI'm On the books we don't need ice breaking down people's doors and dragging mothers and fathers and children out of their beds especially when they've been in our society contributing for a while that's up for ... and it has no place in society so I'm for a strong border but under no circumstances\nShould we be separating stripping a young kids from their parents at the border telling the parents were taking the kids for a bath\nLying to the parents so that the parents are sure the kids you know and then moments later or an hour later two hours later the mothers ask where's my child and they're told you're never going to see your child again you shouldn't have come to America I mean when I heard the stories first hand one on one sitting through glass cross from a mother\nI'm On the southern border I couldn't believe it yeah I could not as someone that's that loves this country that's a raised born and raised in America lived a lot of places in America I cannot believe that I was hearing these stories\nSitting standing on us soil because I'm American stands for a lot of things but it does not stand for that kind of conduct\nYou said that you hear from a lot of people become an accent and dissent as or release of twenty twenty that they want you to run for president or that you should think about running what makes you qualified I guess the standard over the last couple of election cycles [noise]\nHas shifted a little bit I mean first you know President Obama did not have very much time in politics at the federal level before he ran he was criticized for not being experienced\nEnough got an office and and do what he did Mr Trump had no experience in politics kind of around politics didn't have traditional experience Internet traditional ...\nNo I don't but let let me say that we're not run for mayor of Los Angeles while because I'm because I'm going to tell you why you know if if I wanted if I wanted to be a career\nPolitician that I Would already be a career politician I Would I'd be serving in the house or I'd be serving in the Senate or something of that nature that's not the life\nThat I chose it never occurred to you know it it did it occurred to me you know twenty five years ago I mean back in the nineties between a Nineteen Ninety in Nineteen Ninety seven I worked on over a hundred and fifty campaigns and forty two states if you name a big race in the country during that time period I was involved\nIn this was when you worked for Rahm Emanuel's sets when I started\nWorking for Ron and Ron left to go uh worked for Clinton and then I uh splintered off with other individuals and worked on a variety of campaign all democratic ... none of the Republican campaign says well all all around the country and when Nineteen Ninety seven rolled around", "show_name": "Overheard with Evan Smith", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "10"}
