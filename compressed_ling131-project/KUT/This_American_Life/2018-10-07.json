lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know but\nYou but me I spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally divided country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years were\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nTo me this one feels the worst oh I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so I don't like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nThat day at the meeting fleet gets up walks across the room tax Coons on the shoulder and they're on their way to a deal leader he explained what was going through it's had\nIt wasn't the base where I was and what I got over there the ...\nThe food fight just reception of yesterday

quickly as possible [laughter]\nThat's not so good long term does the institution is just horrible [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nPreserving the integrity of the process on the Senate Judiciary committee is much less romantic story than the one about two survivors of sexual assault changing senators' mind at the last second ... that's what happened now\nAnd finally that day the world sees Jeff Flake find third way [laughter] somebody's been looking for for a long time and a lot of issues the way to vote with his Republican colleagues stand for\nCertain principles but the Democrats and the weirdest nice neither weirdo right now ghost Republican he doesn't really have a constituency he's speaking\nFor being anti Trump broke his policies he's retiring from the Senate and a few months and he says\nHe could never have done something like this if you were still running for office there's no value to reaching across the aisle he says there's new currency for that any more you can do that you'll lose so there's not much crossing over to the other side ever by anybody which is maybe why when you do cross over this is what happened\nThis is the consequence New York city loves Senator Jeff flake I Know because the day after the committee vote picked him up at Penn Station got on the taxing\nBut I also called the ... yeah\nI washed away in a taxi why I don't know if that's the thing

on Saturday I ran into Chris Coons on Amtrak\nHe told me flick was on the seller right behind us that we get invited himself\nAlong with Coons to the global citizen concert at the great lawn in Central Park broadcast live on MSNBC you can't think of a blue or place to be honest more on the news location for the hash tag resistance so I'm surprised to hear flakes coming to you and I take them to see if I can go get me credentials and they take them out of town\nGet a little lost because I'm from here I think I Know where everything is but I don't and then we're running across the eighty sixth street transfer\nWe had to a little trailer ... meet up with Chris Coons outside tens of thousands of people are already out on the line\nTwo senators are going to deliver a short impromptu speech about bipartisanship to this crowd\nWas performed before them in his performing\nThirty five out of that is after yeah you guys are the opening act for Carty be\nThis is where flakes reaching across the aisle gesture gets ethical surreal and it's hard to top how surreal the weakest dinner ready\nAll these ... people keep popping into the trailer\nWhat's your ... your ... year old I was just so funny to those people don't lose to Robert\nDe Niro who steps to flake with a finger in his face like a scene from good fellas we rely on you\nToo much just go down with this guy he's got to go [noise]\n'cause I Know it's because they didn't want them in terms of this and that would be ... with the ...\nIt's weird to Robert De Niro say the word in terms I'm telling you your your old man John Legend appreciate withdraw has this week and\nWe just we just know that we're all watching hoping that you make the right decision for the okay that's what I'm saying gee I don't know about is the\nDirector ... thank you so much for listening when\nKatie Holmes in surgery Coons design of that is\nGreat and don't know how to act like using their actions [noise]\nIs that what what has been cutting\nTo be fair neither of the senator seems to know who any of these people are accepting hero everyone wants to picture with the Senator Cruz and fleet of rushed towards the stage and continues to be mobbed by the Hollywood resistance Darren ... them I'm a film maker I may blacks why\nHer last one [laughter]\nI go around in the front to see how ... the artists are receiving the still Republican center\nThat's a real New York\nCall for bipartisan shift as drowned out by calls for\n\nCesar offstage so the star treatment starts again the Reverend Al Sharpton catches him like run a red carpet\nCause you a hero\nGuy is a guy\nDo you think we can bring this country together outside it's like a left wing farce at this point random\nStory was a twenty two year old accused of the murder of Jonas cherry the manager of the mini golf course in her tax this story and an accomplice forced cherry into the back office made him unlock the safe and put the money a few hundred dollars in a bag and then they shot a multiple times\nSorry trial lasted two weeks and would've felt familiar to anyone who watches TV courtroom\nDramas there were lawyers would take binders full of ballistics report and medical examinations character witnesses recalled and disturbing photographs of the victims body were shown the only thing missing was any suspense about the verdict there was no\nDoubt that he was guilty of murder and robbery and [laughter] and so really as a jury or oh we have to worry about ... cents on\nThe jury to decide between life imprisonment or the death penalty it seemed the victim's family knew what they wanted as you go without saying the prosecutor announced the stand and the other jurors that all the Jonas his family and everyone who loved and believed the death penalty is appropriated\nThe prosecutor asked the jurors to sentence Paul story to death\nInstruction stated that for the death penalty to be imposed the jurors must judge three things to be true that Paul story was guilty that there are no mitigating circumstances like say mental illness or provocation and lastly the story posed a future threat to his community\nThat was the one I have an issue with I\nSeriously doubt that he would be a continuing threat to the prison in the\n... ... what what was it about a pause story that made you feel like you just didn't necessarily see him as a continued threat\nUm uh a couple of things are his testimony\nThe young man's fence or in the courtroom that appeared confused in over his head and remorseful this was his first offense and some of the evidence suggested that it was stories accomplice who'd been the mastermind behind the horrible crime as well as the one who fired first on it so then was certain that Paul stories should be punished or they didn't think he should be put to death\nBut [noise] I'm\nIn the dirt chambers there was a very different feel\nEveryone else was in favor\nOf the death penalty so faced with you know almost a dozen other people who already felt strongly I didn't think I could convince anyone to a of of what I was thinking I was I was I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven spend with the youngest your by several years and he was the kind of guy who avoided speaking up at all costs\nAt home his neighbor parked in his face let it go\nAt the office if the boss told them to do something\nEven if you disagreed he did it without question\nIn other words even though he'd been looking forward to being a juror when he found himself in the jury room spend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood the jurors had to reach unanimous decision and the idea swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise]\nHe was also afraid that if he opposed the group it would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole process over again with a new Jerry everyone would\nBe mad at him so sense had nothing to an hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection\nIt was hard to look him during the sons and um we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us you know what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she was trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and she just hopes [noise] when the foreman announced the verdict [noise]\nAnd I think his mother cried out then exit for us to go through after we've collected or things and we were out of the courtroom fast\nIt felt like a mistake right away then went over to his parent's house where you had dinner and drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where he had more to drink before bed and then that was that was over\nAnd uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life or at least he tried to but what do you do with with these feelings\nUm I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and\nUm\nYeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt [noise]\nI've I Know I I felt guilty or\nYou know sending someone or to the fro\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affects you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about\nWhat it does to the jurors\nBut for span the trial isn't something you could put behind them at the crack of the gas all [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict he read every article about the case he could find [noise]\nSo eventually he just stopped\nI realized it wasn't really healthy at the time span was a regular drinker and it only got worse than during the trial got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone there\nA year after the trial and spends life changed the new house with a hammock and the flagpole was sold and spend moved out of Texas\n[laughter]\n... settled in Olympia, Washington started life over he found an apartment for himself and his cat Nico but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial he tried to escape to alcohol but it didn't free him from a shame\nSometimes after a night out drinking in return to a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son one\nMother had already lost her son and now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime and it was terrible but to send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh for for current thoughts about it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rapid gets shame offers a certain safety it provides a comfortable hole to hide in the way from the judgment of others\nBut it can also lead to isolation and inertia and for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date send barely talked about the trial with anybody\nBut then in two thousand sixteen year after\n... stories federal appeal it been denied a reporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your\nSpend was tired of being alone with his regrets and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings\nI felt guilty you told a reporter and sad\nAnd the little helpless\nI don't think I made the right call Bennett hope they're talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published\nThat was when ... received in it\nOver the phone call from a lawyer who read the article spend was at work\n... co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise] it was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment\nWhen in fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been known this trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nCould let them live\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch she reached out\nWith an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness shooter given me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness itself so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor Senate didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message and how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Austin",
