students the code red drilled Trump's all if you hear a fire alarms go off you say put\nThe main question from students both Melissa and actually told me if I'm In the bathroom and I hear gunshots what do I do then\nWe told them to run if you're out in the hallway and there's a code red you have to find a place to hide your cell see either find a place to hide or you run and you keep running and you don't look back\nYou run you run as far away as you can and as fast as you can away from the sound\nAnd like Melissa actually been through this kind of training before out of school she taught out before Douglas that school had a drill that really freaked Ashley out very loud realistic sounds of gunfire actually says there were blanks\nThe officer would walk around with blanks and they would shoot\nAt the door was open they go into the room and say you're all dead end here\nSurprise drills with blanks well not the norm appeal\nTo some schools to say there are benefits to learning

several school safety experts about these drills with planks surprise drills\nThat are hyper realistic none of them that they're a good idea [laughter]\nOne guy who trains teachers using video simulations told me that teachers who've been through one of these surprise drills perform worse\nOn his simulations and teachers who have no training at all\nThey forget crucial that like calling the police and commit more dangerous mistakes\nSometime in the blanks upsetting they can't even\nFinish the simulation and there's a more basic problem the surprise drills [noise]\nIf you know and it's coming and if you're shots how can you tell if it's a drill the real thing [noise]\nIt doesn't actually and Melissa both thought this was kind of draw that have\nUnannounced fake shooter firing line\nActually told their students that's what they should expect\nOh yes one hundred percent I told him I said it could happen at any point in time so just be prepared that no matter which classroom you're enter where you're at this could take place\nThey said it was going to sound real and feel real I now have another faculty member who is that another high school and the district and they did the active shooter training at her school and they they used blanks they like it was it was simulated and it felt real and so that's why a lot of people were like\nIs this the ... is is not the jail but when you look at the time that it occurred\nThey don't run a drill it to twenty five in the afternoon Fifteen minutes before we dismiss and all these buses have to run kids all over the district without a question\nIn your mind right away like it's too late for a true yes\nWhich brings us to the day of the shooting at you twenty in the afternoon on Valentine's Day the former student with an hour Fifteen began down the hall and the first floor of the building that everyone calls the freshman building and an adjacent building actually calling every class had just finished their shrimp can't be lab there are plaguing and cleaning up\nSo I'm standing next to my door pulling my door stop out I'm here to cops it was not rapid fire it was just like a pop pop I'm not startled by it because I mean it's Valentine's Day and you don't know if it's like a balloon popping or what and then the fire alarm went off very quickly\nAnd the fire alarm dust set it off\nJust from a who's took all tile hit by a round of gunshots no one knew that at the time Melissa and a building farther out than actually didn't hear any pops just a fire alarm she went into action running natural the fire drill\nThe fire alarm goes off and I counted the kids as as they left the room as the last one to leave I close the door was already locked because I leave it locked out the door with my son\nHe's my father does like famous important things my phone in that case ... her emergency folder that's the training\nI went out the doors that security person who's posted outside my hallway she's there and I said oh what's going on because they have walkie talkies I don't the security personnel have I talked to she said someone set off a firecracker and the twelve hundred building and I said OK and turned into other teachers and I told them and then as soon as I finish saying that's them she out that no\nGo back it's a code red go back to code red and so we\nCalled to the kids and I turned around and went back to my room which is right there opened up the door and kids start streaming in\nBut was this a real code red molested in now she knew a fire alarm could go off during a code red but the whole thing was confusing\nWell it was weird because we actually had a ... actual fire drill earlier in the day like\nLike our plans scheduled monthly drill had occurred that morning so it was weird that it was going off again because\nThey don't do them in the last period of the day and so I knew it was something but I didn't think it was a serious something I thought it was like a the common area was cooking with oil that day so who knows what to say that oftentimes set up and fired more so than his office they burn something or whatever so\nThe other thing that set a fire drill a well kids sometimes probably pull\nKids will pull it off sometimes there could be like a faulty that's why our system gets affected all the time it just\nJulia must be said you're okay\nAm I Julius said\nBut the school does not do during the fire alarms evacuate like they're supposed to\nNo one goes outside to the parking lot no one jokes about calling Harry\nKnowing moves not a single class evacuated\nWas it says it's too scary to be out there standing in the parking\nLot like that vulnerable\nIt's what they know now\nDrones have blind spot [laughter]\n...
