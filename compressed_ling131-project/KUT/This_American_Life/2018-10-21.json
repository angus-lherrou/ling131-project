these similar choices but the special language is that's that's different when we talk about special language is this is more common in twins but can also occurred between\nSame age unrelated incidents were raised together\nAnd because twins tend to spend a lot of time together and perhaps less language experience with an adult\nThey often will develop their own verbal expressions or physical gestures and so this may actually hold back their language development but this in no way implies any kind of telepathy you know if you think about how you may have a best friend and you and the best friend kind of exchange a glance at times\nAnd the whole situation is summed up in a glance\nThat's identical twins are so good at and so many demands of behavior\n[noise] have you seen that Youtube video of the twins that I think they're Eighteen months old maybe they are younger than that and they're just going back\nTo each other and laughing at each other's jokes [noise]\nThe book I show that to my students every semester and I love it and to me that video captures the evolution of the twin bond and the so called twin language those kids are hysterical\nAnd they know what's funny and yet we don't but I Will tell you that I spoke to him other ones who had an older child and twins and she said that the older child can often act as a translator telling her what the twins are up to him and I thought\nIsn't that interesting maybe a linguist could use those older siblings as research assistants to find out what's going on [noise]\nSo what about the depiction of twins culturally identically draft twin toddlers may delight does some twins like the ones in the shining terrify us\nThere are lots of twins and mythology twins is God's evil twins and so on why does the idea of twins so consistently captain made us\n[noise] in the arts in mythology in movies and literature twins are very convenient devices for exploring duality good and evil happy and sad now why is the public so enchanted with twins\nI think it's because we all grew up believing and rightfully so that we're all individuals that we looked different we behave differently\nI think that when we encounter to people who look and act so much alike it challenges the way we think that the world works and many of us admire and even envy the intimacy that identical twins convey\nThere is so accepting of one another so nonjudgmental and who among us would want to enjoy your relations with that kind so for some people seeing identical twins my almost seem claustrophobic too much togetherness but on the other hand there are still intrigued by it so I think that's why we are so captivated\nWhich brings us back to that documentary three identical strangers for a minute there is one doctor who had some involvement with the study but the triplets were unwittingly engaged in and she said this [noise]\nThat we have some influence over our lives\nNot to control and so finding out of a mind\nTo see holding influence they have little control now we don't like the\nGenes don't tell us what to do they may predispose us in certain ways but ultimately we make the choice to do something we know that divorce has a genetic component to it but we can choose to stay with a partner or divorce\nWe have a lot of control over our lives is just the genes may guide us in certain sorts of directions I think a great example of that is a pair of twins we studied in Minnesota named Jack an Oscar they're born in Nineteen thirty three\nJak was raised Jewish by his father in Trinidad and Oscar was raised Catholic and Nazi Germany with his mother Oscar was in the Hitler Youth but he was only twelve in the war ended\nThese too of course had very different political and historical understandings but they both cope with the situations in similar ways jak by becoming very pro British in Trinidad because he didn't want people to know of his German background and Oscar becoming very pro German because he didn't want people to know if his Jewish background\nAnd when they met they spoke to one another and realize that had their positions been reversed they both would have embraced a point of view that they currently disliked so the context in which we find ourselves certainly can make a difference but we can choose or not choose\nA certain perspective or a certain way of looking at things\nYou've hurt me refer a couple of times to nature versus nurture oh yeah I Do things to things separate and in ...\nYeah that is really reductive right yes in fact I should have probably caught you on that we never really say nature versus nurture that's a false dichotomy that was put to rest years ago what we talked about is nature and nurture or nature the and nurture\nNature and nurture is a nice conceptualization of that because if you think about how you put your house together or the occupations you have or\nHow your environment is constructed you see genetic influence on your environment you know you choose to put certain paintings on the wall you choose certain outfits you choose a certain design of your home why do you do that because they are pleasing to you in some way in an individual nature and nurture are completely intertwined cannot be separated\nWe separate them only statistically in in the population and that\nCan give us a good handle on what somebody's\nChance of having Alzheimer's or diabetes or something like that might be but it's not totally determined that stick we know for example that autism has a high genetic component we know that from twin studies on the order about Seventy percent but given twin pair if you've won affect the child the other one maybe never ever affected by autism so you can't\nGeneralize from the population to the individual you can only use this as a very rough guide\n[noise] so you have a fraternal twins do you ever wish you had an identical [laughter]\nYou know I thought about that sometimes I never want to give up my fraternal twin but I think more that I Wish we were triplets and there was a fraternal as an identical I think it'd be kind of fun I Am fascinated by identical twins and they had them to see that they share and the similarities that they display so I've often wondered what it would be like but I'm very happy with my situation as it is\nSometimes I Wish I had an evil twin [laughter] there's no such thing [laughter]\nThank you so much thank you so much Dr Nancy Segal is a professor of psychology at California State University

has never been on the radio\nWe put it together for a the episode that we did this fall let me ... ways and then we had so much material for that episode that we simply could not fit it into the hour long program and so we put it into the pod cast version of the show but it's never played here on the air and um this is one of the stories that really came out of this a question that we had on our staff\nYou may have heard or read that the president has cut the number of refugees\nOfficially allowed into the United states from hundred ten thousand which is what it was under the previous administration to forty five thousand less than half but ... in fact this year and this fiscal year they're not even gonna bring in that many people just twenty two thousand more arrive\nIt's a small number ever in the history of the refugee program here and you're not show we didn't understand why right the administration said its own number at forty five thousand that's the number they set for themselves why we're just twenty two thousand admitted\nAnd one of our producers is Zoe Chace she looked into this trying to figure it out and um and to understand the answer that she found you have to go back to this promise that the president made back when he was a candidate you may remember this one\nDonald J trough is calling for a total and complete shutdown\nOf Muslims entering the United states\nUntil our country's representatives\nWhat the hell is going on [noise]\nAccidents in the very first week in office with the travel ban right banned travel to the United states from seven countries but that was not all it did it also shut\nDown the refugee program like there was easy program from all countries all over the world was like a total and complete shutdown for one hundred twenty days the ideas shut it down for ... days with the ministers and figured out what the hell was going on\nIn other words how we vet refugees that we resettle in this country and the ... days theoretically the refugee resettlement program was supposed to start back up again but then something weird happened refugee resettlement it never really started back up again not full force within the numbers\nTake Iraq okay which is not on the president's travel ban list the final one last year we let in six thousand eight hundred eighty six refugees\nThis year a hundred and thirty okay how come like what happened they went through a process that came to a conclusion they fix their thing should started back up what happened there were searched around and found somebody who actually knows\nBack when Donald J ... said he wanted to know what the hell was going on what he meant was what the vetting process for how we figure out who gets to come in you didn't trust what was already in place\nSo when he announced the travel ban the White House pulled together people from across agencies homeland security the state department National Counterterrorism intelligence all the people you'd want in a room like that\nOne of the people in the room was Barbara ... she was the chief of refugee admissions for us CIS USDA as being a part of homeland security that handles immigration she remembers their first meeting on day one of a hundred and twenty\nWe met in large conference room that was really full of people around the table and people are against the law and\nA lot of people a lot of people\nBarber said on the way most people in the room or looking at it was like this the refugee program is already incredibly rigorous month sometimes years of interviews data collection security checks\nThe people in the room where like we think of this is very safe OK let's do better with Nico we already think is extreme vetting more extreme it was a real Eighteen the top people barber says everyone was on the same age\nOur goal is that this program is up and running again on Monday a hundred and Twenty one so we need to be very organized we need to meet quickly and get the program through the other side where the confidence again\nI talked to three other officials were involved in the hundred and twenty a group to still work in government and they all felt like Barbara let's put her back into it focus hit the target so they do it they need they divide into sub groups they write up a report that makes a bunch of recommendations which are classified\nMy impression from Barbara and the others who worked on this was we implemented every improvement we could imagine to a process that was already tight and the final conclusion of this group of experts was if you Institute these improvements into the process that we already has for sure it is safe\nTurn the program that will go ahead started meeting refugees again with the more extreme vetting that you want it and then\nAnd about a hundred and ten a hundred and twenty days they hear back from the White House\nThe White House did not like the conclusion that this review and according to Barbara and the others they spoke to in the group the White House wanted it to change\nThey expressed concern about the recommendations resume refugee processing of all nationalities and do you know which nationalities the White House was worried about\nTrying not to say this record is probably not\nI was told that there was particular concern about I'm slowly nationals\nDemonstration specifically pointed to Somalis as the sticking point why\nI honestly can't speculate we don't want to affect you know I honestly I to this day I don't know\nAnd there's no rationale that you were given like because Mali is\nLike this or like\nThe rationale wasn't shared with me\nTo government officials confirmed this for me Somalia wasn't the only concern they said but it was a major concern is chief of staff John Kelly in particular was unhappy they said I think it was both\nOne guy in the group told me at the end of the day the data didn't show that Somalis were any special risk\nSo after a hundred and twenty days the White House reopen the refugee program for some countries but not for a handful of countries who make up a lot of the refugees that are resettled here for Somalia\nIntent others including all the countries in the original travel ban the refugee program would stay suspended for them a hundred and twenty day review got another Ninety Days\nMy boss asked me to think about options for how to address the White House's concerns\nUrban says she and the other members of her group or sort of at a loss for what else they could possibly review but they went back to work they came up with some more recommendations after Ninety Days in January twenty team the White House did we start to hold refugee program but it was like turning on a faucet", "show_name": "This American
