ballot questions or concerns and fears ticket raised and get propagated about\nSex offenders in bathrooms and men just taking advantage of these laws to pretend that they are transgender pretend to go into women's restrooms just so they can lurk in there then they take out a tablet computer and say there's actually been ads\nThey they made an ad just about to show to you\nAnd say here's the thing that they call inoculation which is basically exposing\nIn a controlled does this opposition message which they know it's really likely that that this voter cutting counter you know on Facebook or when they're watching the news and what they want to do is administer this opposition message in a controlled environment where the voter\nIsn't alone where they're not seeing a bunch of other comments on Facebook they can encounter this with somebody there to walk them through and help pull them back\nFrom the brink it's a lot like getting a flu vaccine or where your body gets a tiny tiny bit of the flu virus and the white blood cells in your in your blood just are like oh okay we know what to do in case we encounter it later [noise]\nMagazine ... going to find [noise]\nLike what did you think about that does it raise any concerns for you [noise]\nKnow thinking of laying [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter] I mean ...\nOr a few people aren't any credit he came home or whatever they want you to St Louis cannot check [laughter] I hear what\nYou're saying you're sort of saying that um she and her people should have their own place to go just so they they can kind of be spared from people who might have a problem with it [noise]\nYeah I think if you're going out to eat you know they have All right\nI think things like that\nTo be nice to sleep or whatever right [noise]\nUm that's a that's a really interesting um perspective I mean I don't think I've heard that phrase quite that way before that it makes a lot of sense and a lot of ways [noise] sitting this complicated about it I think that there are a lot of transgender people who you wouldn't know or transgender walking down the street you know what I mean\nI think it's a little dicey it where you draw the line you know what I mean [noise]\nBeatrice at the start of this conversation you know was really she was confused at first about the wording the question but that was like oh yeah I ... yes I support equal rights for everybody it's sort of thing everybody can kind of agree on and then she suddenly introduce this idea that\nThis could allow sex offenders and criminals to take advantage of this week law and put her grandkids at risk and then she suddenly starts to weigh a bunch of things on one hand she says she used to be a nurse and she would have never turned away a transgender person at the same time she's like ever since I was a little kid I went to Catholic school and like\nThere were boys' rooms and girls are up and and that's just like how the world has worked all along\nWhen the campus or D left Beatrice this house what was the net net of the conversation\nSo at the end he has the same question she asked at the beginning how are you\nGonna vote on this when are the ... are ... on the ballot will you vote yes to keep these protections or vote no to repeal [noise]\nSo yeah so would you say definitely yes are probably [noise]\nHow do you feel that went [noise]\nWhat you're saying about having um different restaurants or gender people like the words like separate but equal cross\nThrough my head and that's not necessarily the right argument to bring\nTo her because it's you know we don't want to be too confrontational over doing this work um 'cause we can't you know we can't bring somebody all the way but she was somebody she she was she was a nice lady definitely a good conversation\nLet me take one second\nI'm gonna call so I don't know I left feeling a little more skeptical some conversations I definitely felt certain I was like you have to sort of binoculars an idea has happened but I think a lot of times\nIt can be messy and you leave people\nWith like a storm of ideas that maybe aren't completely resolved and some of it like you're not going to resolve and then ten or Fifteen minute conversation with a stranger out your door and maybe it planted a seed and now is Beatrice Jesus in the new season the newspapers he's a commercial like this show understand the context which it exists but it's also possible that she'll never really think of this again\nNo this is all interesting bit of a political science and campaign strategy speculation at the moment but it's also something particularly of the moment\nThe Trump Administration\nApparently is working on a worked around so that transgender as a category of citizen effectively will cease to be and then therefore any particular protections rendered moved\nJust that added urgency to the question three campaign\nMy theory going into this and what I heard from people on the ground there is that basically if this loses in Massachusetts antitrust activists all over the country can go around and they say if liberal Massachusetts doesn't want these protections why should we have them in Wyoming or West Virginia or anywhere that they've come up for debate so\nFar as the mainstream even for the People's Republic of Massachusetts\nExactly I think the other thing is that it took a long time for the gay rights movement to get to a point where they had majority support it can be really hard to get a majority of people to vote for minority especially if they don't know them or if they don't understand that\nThe trends community is so much smaller than the gay and lesbian community I think it can be even harder to move the needle so if a strategy like this inoculation thing works or at least shows us a new angle that that might be able to be taken in the ... movement\nIt's promising I don't know that it might work as well on an issue like abortion that a lot of people have thought a lot about and made up their minds I think that's where the research wants to see where you can continue this right now I think it works\nOn something that people haven't actually given a lot

her car this big blue duster I think I was on\nAnd um her boyfriend was there and her and her boyfriend had let the cats out uh-huh and they were they were gone and she was furious\nAnd and I got in

and we were out of there\nWell what did you think\nIt made me I think I felt sad for her mhm\nI remember thinking this is sort of in retrospect but I think I had some sort of being clean up this idea at the time I'm just I'm just sort of not realizing that but I think I remember thinking that he was one of the few people that you had in her life and she couldn't even really depend on him\nYeah you're probably right even Straggler\nMhm yeah yeah you you may have been um at that point at that moment her only for [noise] you know [noise]\n[noise] you\nKnow when\nMy mom didn't have any idea

kids her husband was a lawyer I got a number from information and it wasn't until I sat down to color that it hit me a phone call from someone you babysat Twenty years ago might not be a welcome
