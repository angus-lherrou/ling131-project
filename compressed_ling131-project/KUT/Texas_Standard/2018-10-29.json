longtime state climatologist professor Nielsen Gammon welcome to Texas standard no bigger and bigger I think this is somewhat counterintuitive are a lot of our listeners\nSort of wonder could this be real that the number of severe weather I'm a uh situations related to tornadoes and hurricanes\nHas actually been declining how how so [noise] well\nThis year has been at least for for a tornadoes or a very good year for Texas we rode very few of them [noise] ah you know normally are severe weather season is primarily April May and June\nAnd I think it just so happened that during this particular year we we did not get the right kind of what it says what was going to allow that to happen\nUh there were these a number of tornadoes um farther north and further east or even believe it or not Wyoming has had more turnout up in Texas wow\nI'm which we don't mind particularly but I think this is really just so probably a lot of things we don't really know about long term trends onto because we haven't really been systematically looking for tornadoes and so like around the\nMagazine argued fibers a storm chasing got big so we'll have twenty years' worth of record right we look around well\nNow I Want to turn our attention to hurricanes because of course we had a a quite a hurricane last year or what have you been seeing a so far this year\n[noise] yeah but this year has come out a pretty close to normal Emily normally have about Thirteen named storms and the Atlantic ocean basin and the\nBack of the civil air and I'm In the ... and the storm came on shark in Florida and the tremendous amount of damage that's all it it only takes one started to make about hurricane season for the United states because of the potential for damage that's\nNow let me let me ask you something about that because of course we've been seeing a lot of rain across Lone Star state over the past us certainly several weeks and a lot of uh a lot of meteorologists are predicting another wet November\nSo do you think that these events are in any way a related or or just a a correlated coincidental\nOh so if you look at the big picture actually rainfall overall and Texas has gone up by about five or ten percent over the past century\nSo it seems to be getting wetter um in terms of extreme rain fall as we get those we get down to like very ... moms are very wet day before the thing that causes flooding\nThere the the connection with climate change a little bit stronger and the but for example after Harvey there have been several studies looking at\nA historic trends in rainfall and it seems that those super intense storms actually are producing on the order of about ten twenty or even thirty percent more intense rain than they would have if they have like a hundred years ago so\nA unfortunately that's the sweat whether they have the ... the funding is probably being enhanced by the warmer temperatures but we've been saying globally and the change of weather pattern that goes along with that\nAs you pull back and I know you're reluctant to do this but what's the take away from you know you were tornadoes\nOr an apparent reduction or at least a sort of the status quo when it comes to hurricanes and a whole lot more rain is there is there a way to tired altogether and give us a sense of what we're looking at for the next five or ten years or is just no way\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I think a conversation that kind of clear that you can't make blanket statements about extreme weather climate change doesn't make all extreme weather worse doesn't recall extreme weather better we get to\nA warmer temperature of more heat waves and they give us viewer in ten days of cold so each aspect of the weather then flip and different way by changes in climate so\nIt's difficult to generalize in that regard um the the the things that the remote confident about in terms of climate or are rising temperatures which are gotten above the\nThe background variability level in Texas or the ... century or southern noticed way hotter rainfall average rainfall still is quite variable so the trend has not really come out of beyond\nThe randomness put half of this from year
