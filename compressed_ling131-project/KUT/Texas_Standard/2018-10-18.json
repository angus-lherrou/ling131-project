we want you to tell us something you've done in the last year that has nothing to do with politics that would've Texans inside to who you are as a person Sen Cruz you first [noise]\nThe hardest thing\nAbout being in this job\nMy my girls are here at the last last debate\nCongressmen Iraq and I talked about that both of us are dads have young kids\nAnd it is tough it is tough our girls are seven and ten\nMonday morning leaving\nYou know last year I was helped coach Caroline's\nGirls' basketball team the fourth grade basketball team the basketball practices were were Sunday afternoon I was able to be at the practice says as Caroline will point out many times\nIn the course of the whole season I made it to one game\nThat's not okay with her\nBy the way one of the games that I thought I was going to make it to be a friday night game I was planning to come back it was the night of the vote on the tax cuts\nAnd so I was in the Senate and I had to call home and say Caroline I'm Sorry I've got to be here to vote on this let me tell you for for a fourth grader the fact that you're voting to cut taxes is not an explanation for why daddy is not at the game\nThat's really a hard thing ... you know\nBeing a dad any part of what we do with what we call and say unsafe time and and we try to try to carve out every Sunday for the family but that is hard centered and I take Vienna dad\nReally sitter thank you for sharing a as well to cars for sixty seconds\nYou know I I I think much of what Senator Cruz just said resonates with me we spent the better part of the last Twenty one months on the road campaigning and every single County Texas don't get to see um my kids as much as I Want to know that Amy takes on that the lion's share of the burden with the\nChild is just entered sixth grader another who's in fifth and and Henry who's who's in second every now and then we get down in the basement where I have a drum kit that ostensibly was purchased for Henry what really was

animal rescue run by ms Julie ah got to meet this blind squirrel who's a slowly regaining its site\nUm you know Henry um ah one of the best parts of my day is when I Am at home getting to walk him to school and just talking about what he dreamed about the night before and what he's into a this day so with very little time uh\nOutside of the campaign or my official job I spend it with my family cars would say I'm sharing as well to we've actually goes a lot of questions so now we want to let you guys address Texas voters directly you both get two minutes\nFor closing statements here as we mentioned early on a flip the coin gives you the final works nights and or the cruise congressmen work through our First Listen I'm I just want to thank you reach for for moderating this debate everyone\nWho has been here to witness it and all those who've made a this campaign in the election of our lifetime possible um I was talking to Amy tonight about this moment that stayed with me um after I first met secretary of defense Jim Mattis\nUh he's meeting with members of the armed Services Committee and he reminded us that the United states historically has enjoyed\nTwo principal power is a distinguished us from the rest of the world one is the power of intimidation to feel the the most awesome military force the world has ever known\nMany other uh any thought maybe the greater power is the power of of inspiration\nTo continue to be the indispensable nation that lives up to the promise and the potential of our founders are a nation that not just Americans look up to but the world that looks up to and whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now\nWalls Muslim vans the press as the enemy of the people taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying two thousand mile journey seeking asylum here in this country the bitterness\nThe partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of the national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nBut I'll tell you what traveling the state of Texas\nMeeting people regardless of their walk of life their background their party affiliation new have inspired me you've inspired me to transcend\nThe obstacles to be the big courageous bowl strong match for this woman on any issue that challenges us\nUh in Texas were nearly half the school teachers work a second job just to make ends meet making sure that we're there for them pay them a living wage and ensure that they can teach to the child not the test and the state of

universal healthcare you on this and that ... in this race and I'm grateful to have the chance that is around ... thank you Senator Cruz two minutes\nThe classic question in politics\nAre you better off now than you were two years ago\nElections are about choices\nDo we continue on the path we're on or do we turn back\nThe records of congressmen Iraq and myself could not be more different on taxes I Want to cut your taxes congressman Iraq wants to raise\nOn job killing regulations I Want to repeal um congressman O'Rourke wants to increase\nI Want to repeal Obamacare reduced premiums protect preexisting conditions and expand access congressman O'Rourke want socialized medicine the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor which among other things would threatened bankrupt Medicare\nI Want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going moving forward congressman ... wants to the next two years to be drawn into the partisan circus of impeachment proceedings against President Trump\nElections are about who we are\nThe we choose fear\nMy mom was the first one at a family to go to college and she was a pioneer professional woman my dad came from Cuba with nothing\nWash dishes making fifty cents an hour came here seeking the American dream if someone had approached my dad in Nineteen fifty seven fifty years has your son will be a U.S senator representing the state of Texas that teenage immigrant could never believed it\nAnd yet as I stood on the Senate floor with my hand on my dad Bible there with my father and the gallery tears running down his eyes\nThis is a choice about keeping the boom going keeping we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded the lowest African American unemployment ever recorded why would we want to screw that up we need to stand jobs defend the constitution are going to lose\nTheir ... their thoughts are we appreciate Mr Cruz Mr ... thank you for sharing tonight we appreciate

G was last seen entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul October second\nSaudi officials have denied any involvement president Donald Trump has said that he could take action against the world's largest oil exporter if it\nWere revealed Saudi Arabia was indeed responsible for cars show jeeze debt\nWhat sort of implications are we talking about uh what would that mean for the oil industry in Texas Michael Webber is following this he's acting director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin professor Weber welcome\nTo thank you very much for inviting me a Saudi Arabia has deep ties to Texas in Houston in particular have billions of dollars in investments in Saudi Arabia and in fact the Saudis have been making some pretty big place in the Permian Basin too\nSo what are these current diplomatic tensions due to this relationship\n[noise] well it's a tricky relationship and it's been tricky for decades so competition is not new city Texas Audi or the American Saudi relationship\nA lot of it is a tire that's business down there is the best men from the U.S Saudi Arabia or from Texas Tech company there and vice versa Saudi Arabia has a lot of investment Texas as you noted including I Believe that our largest refinery and the nature in Texas are either partly owned by\nSaudi Arabian interest so this is a complicated relationship\nAnd the good news is it puts a position to have common cars to tackle some of the world's challenges the bad news is is a Saudi Arabia does things that we disagree with it sometimes makes it harder for us the text or an action because it might put some of our own business interests at risk\n... one of the markets like right now and you are they reflecting this tension\nI think the markets are too few because there's a lot of things going on right now prices are higher now than they were a year ago that's also because of Iran and sanctions and increasing demand those are all putting upward pressure on prices\nAre things that putting our pressure on prices are higher prices themselves tend to be self correcting but also policies are on electric vehicle sitting back out of it so there's a lot of difference it was going on the markets not a whole lot to from a I think\nRight now I think are in a wait and see attitude right now\nYou know the ah foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia sent in a statement and I want to quote this the kingdom emphasizes that it will respond to any measure against it with an even stronger measure that\nTim's economy has an intellectual and vital role in the global economy close quote [noise]\nNow I don't want to take this too far but there's been this I'm a ... ... the Saudis have not since at least in the days of the old Arab oil embargo of the seventies tried to use oil is a kind of geo political weapon\nIf you will do you think that they're talking about going back to to to to using to weaponize in oil if you will\nIs it certainly sounds like they are and so that's the tough talk from Portland\nChanges leadership rest of their different people charged with Saudi Arabia now but a few decades ago Saudi Arabia is really a person to sell for decades as a college or global player like in the\nMarkets staple not looking to disrupt things the Cold War hearing in the last few days or weeks out there and that where sounds a little more involvement I Would say um that used to happen with bullet hurts from Iran by the way when oil prices are higher I often jumped in the class but I talk to track\nBelligerence work out from speeches from Iranian leaders because oil prices higher moral prior the more confident Iranian leadership was and therefore the more they were and I'm Wondering if we're seeing something to learn how to write their\nPrices are higher gives more confidence for years oil as a weapon or tougher talk so it might just be lost her might just be tough talk which we don't know what's actually change their policy\nIs somebody that Saudi Arabia are in the seventies certainly and in the eighties or the other way around ramping up production the cause of global oil price collapse which bankrupted a lot of their competitors many of them in Texas so all I can can be caused by spike or collapse but it hasn't been done in decades maybe where it's going to change and to\nDr wherever you know I think just a few days ago a weeks ago no one would have imagined that someone like ... would just walk into a constantly and and disappear and and then these allegations would come out that perhaps he was killed and dismembered if you have a loved one or relative working right now in Saudi Arabia\nShould you worry [noise]\nI don't think that if you're a family member or a lot more work in Saudi Arabia right now you have to worry that they're going to be active part where the salt which I'm Sorry for the fertile language but that appears to be what's what's happened recently Saudi Arabia and that's something that really upset and for the United states\nIt's a I think you don't have to worry about general ex patriots working over there that particular this journalist was someone who was working on stories that were critical you've been on a watch list and Saudi Arabia for a while he was targeted I don't think it's um a broader effort by Saudi Arabia to\nTarget Americans in general so I don't think they need to be worried however if I were over there I'd be worried about coming across too critical because apparently Saudi Arabia doesn't his credit very well\nSo I can hear my caution that my ... I don't think there's a widespread fear that kind of activity this kind of a brutal activities going to happen with a lot of people\nMichael Webber continues to follow these rapidly changing developments he's acting director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin professor Weber thanks so much for speaking with us again to the standard\nThat they travelling [noise]\n\nIn for social media editor wells Dunbar it's Texas standards don't Michel marks good to see on this Wednesday\nHey good to see David San Antonio hosted the second in probably final debate between Senator Ted Cruz and representative Beto O'Rourke last night yeah I guess a early voting begins next week yeah\nI think ah yeah coming right up I had a recap at the top of the show we'll have some fact checks coming later on right now let's check in with what Texans who tuned in ... the big headline for many is held representative overt conducted himself\nA more aggressively namely calling US Senator all talk no action dishonesty and that Ted Cruz is for Ted Cruz not necessarily his constituents to not do mixed reactions from rogue supporters this tweet from Twitter user sleeping med student\nMan I Love that too but that debate wasn't his best performance he's stoop to personal insults and didn't fully answer some questions the performance didn't dampen spirits of Mickey Schwartz mayor though she writes in part on the Texas ...

marketplace at us in research poll a majority of people think that financial institutions in tech companies like apple Amazon and Google have greater sway over the economy then the president's Congress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace stuck Hi Molly\nHayes debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and to tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of tax and bank finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result they crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican or democratic or the people at Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent wasn't majority but six to eight percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders had breast Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seeing policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm Federal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole it's a big summit in Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and\nHow they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so\nIt is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned nevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about and they want these platforms to do better
