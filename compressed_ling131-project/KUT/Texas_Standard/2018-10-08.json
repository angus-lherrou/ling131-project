approve this is a method to attract big money to cure blindness Karen good to hear your voice again Oh thank you so much that you've helped draft a bill that in these polarized times has gotten some bipartisan support\nIt is indeed bipartisan and I think that's because this spill is the highest right it's a pilot program to use a very carefully crafted federal guarantee that we do not believe will cost taxpayers any money to speed all the promising treatments insurers starting with wine that's\nOver what's called the valley of death where public\nFunding stops for venture capital and ... money kicks in the middle where you prove whether these promising treatments insurers are really going to cure or something and this bill create something called I bonds he y e bonds to test this idea\nOn the upside is an interesting upside for an investor who kicks in some money to help research blindness and let's say it turns out it was a great idea and it starts to take off they don't just get their money back what what happens\nMost importantly they do get their money back there'll be a package of projects in each bond\nSo that even if a few fail the taxpayers protected and the

reshaped our last\nAll that more if it day on the Texas [laughter]\n\nAre so far Ninety One percent of already registered what does that tell you\nWell now tells me you know that there's a lot of folks who are you know we're getting into registering to vote and it also speak for the mobilization effort is going on there and Travis County because um you know registering to vote is not the simplest of things you know when I wrote my students on voter registration on those forms can be very challenging for for people who\nYou have to do the residential address mailing address it at the Stanford process so kudos to the folks that are in Travis County of their registration efforts\nWell let's talk about other parts of Texas I mean the McCalla monitor was recently writing about voter turnout in the valley is being consistently low during past elections and in fact that's led some candidates for statewide office not to visit the area\nYou think that this year could be any different given the ah will how we've seen Democrats energized and we know that a good part of south Texas is a majority democratic\n[noise] um yeah I saw that and I I'm In my own county north county or Corpus Christi is located turnouts registration is also\nOne thing I Wonder about some other research I've been doing in Texas politics as their show where science is real demographic shifts and and the electric you know we're having\nUm a is a huge cohort of younger voters coming on on and this could be there for a selection of him so you know there could be some enthusiasm there um what the campaigns with what's going on in a lot of registration efforts going on the electric\nYou know this is something interesting and I wonder if either of you've seen this story more than two thousand applications to register to vote in Texas submitted through an online service\nAre invalid according to the secretary of state's office or Texas doesn't allow online registration but apparently a Web site run by a California based nonprofit called ... dot ORG\nStarted found a loophole by allowing voters to fill out an online application and attach a photo of their signature which they then backs and mailed to election administrators but now the state saying no that's not going to be valid have you have you seen this story\n[noise] I've seen it yeah this is what a lot of Republicans worried about right the California station of taxes I think that that is definitely the case that\nThat these groups are interested in finding a way to get more Texans registered to vote there are as many of these organizations as like seats in the ... so that's one thing and Carlos mentioned this to that is really helpful and getting\nMore registered voters out there in fact the number registered voters has been going up since about the Nineteen nineties and so\nYou can find now these are the bail these these notes devote anywhere you can get a libraries and taco stands on every other restaurant you know up and down the the you know Congress Avenue in Austin so\nThere are good things about this but the problem is getting people to then go register to vote and problems like this pop up their problems and also in Harris County that popped up with respect to\nSome of the people who are otherwise eligible had been kicked off the rolls or a kind of a fluke and so this is something which the state needs to address and if they can't then there's always going to be out of a lag in terms of\nWell you know something we should point out too is that the secretary of state's office maintains its position that uh these are not valid or there are some counties some officials in some counties who say their position is they're going to go ahead and accept these ah registration attempts until someone with authority tells him not to\nSo this could wind up being another post election day ... of course we'll we'll have to wait and see I think something that we've been sort of hinting at but I think we should address directly is the fact that registration obviously is one thing\nShowing up to the polls is another does any of this activity signaled anything about the midterms per se\nYou know voting in the United states it's tougher than it is a most nations and most of the boxes on the world you're automatically registered to vote so we've got to take a different step and so people are so in this kind of enthusiasm for the rest of the vote pretty nice of you know it has to be at least thirty is for the election to me that is an indication that there is a higher level of interest in selection\nAnd of course you have to vote to vote so you know I'm not expecting it to you know shattered you know sixty percent voted for anything like that but I Would expect that you know my expectation is this going to be higher than it's been said in the ... and we had um a twenty um fourteen fourteen minutes from now it'll be hard on that one I Would expect random\n[noise] I think so and like like Carlos says you know we've seen this lag and it's been pretty consistent I'd part of the reason is because the state has been dominated by one party or the other for the better part of last hundred plus years so now the Republican dominated and Democrats feel like their voice doesn't matter\nUm we also live at the fact that Latino turnout is lower than it is and other states um the number of eligible Latinos to vote is about forty four percent and that's in contrast to about eighty percent for the Anglo population states also young I I think are less pointed to some really good for six figures which suggests that you know a young state is not likely to turn out\nVoters who have more money mortgages and marriages are more likely to turn out and younger voters don't always have that so it's difficult to get people too\nGo from the stop of being registered to being mobilized by a group by a party or by candidate\nRented rotting houses political science professor at the
