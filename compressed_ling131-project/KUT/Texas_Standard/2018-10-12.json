Jason ... and ... it's the latest picture ... inches now who won an Oscar two years ago the directing the musical la la land\nFilm critic Justin Chang has been seen the\nFirst man might be one of the noisiest clunky is most you know we get movies about space travel ever made and I mean that in a good way the film adapted from James are Hansen's biography of Neil Armstrong returns us to a time when NASA technology was in its early stages\nWe first meet Armstrong played by Ryan Gosling as a test pilot in Nineteen sixty one flying a small fighter jet over Southern California at an altitude up around a hundred and forty thousand feet\nThe director Damien ... doesn't give us anything so beautiful was an exterior shot at the plane's going through the sky he locks us inside the cockpit\nThe engine noises deafening the images blurry and disorienting the tense close ups of Armstrong's eyes and the rattling motions of the aircraft remind you of the irrationality of human flight the sheer violence of defying the laws of physics\nYou learn a lot about Armstrong in this scene alone he doesn't say much and he's very very good at his job\nEven back on terror for the camera has a lingering case of the jitters there's a hand held rough Mr the scenes of meal at home with his wife Janet played by an excellent clear for and their children\nTragedy strikes early on the Armstrong's lose their two year old daughter Karen to cancer Neal is devastated and throws himself into his work seeking a fresh start he moved the family to Houston and enters NASA's Gemini astronaut training program\nAlthough gorgeously scored by ... longtime composer Justin her with first ma'am looks and sounds nothing like their musicals whiplash and Lala land\nBut it has the same outsized ambition\nThe movie captures the flux and upheaval of the sixties when NASA found itself caught between the pressures of the Cold War with its mandate to beat the Russians by any means and the resistance of a public unhappy with the program which cost millions of taxpayer dollars and several astronauts lives\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop ... and his screenwriter just singer set themselves the tricky task of dramatizing the inner life of an American hero known for his lack of flash or pretension\nIn one scene Neal was interviewed by NASA panel and he responds to even a probing personal question in a stoic professional way\nI don't know what space exploration well uncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nDidn't even have anything else yeah\nYou know sorry to hear about your daughter\nI'm Sorry to hear the question\nRight what I mean uh\nDo you think it will have an effect\nI think it would be\nA reasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nHow carefully Armstrong guarded his privacy before and especially after the moon landing there's something a bit invasive about the way first manned keeps returning to caring staff linking family tragedy and professional triumph\nFor the most part should selling Gosling respect Armstrong's reticence he's unwillingness to speak unless absolutely necessary\nIs home life predictably suffers as it becomes emotionally withdrawn from Janet in their two sons but he develops a balance of warm camaraderie and unspoken rivalry with his fellow pilots played by actors including Jason Clarke Patrick future Ethan Embry and Christopher Abbott\nCorey stole gets an amusing loud enough performance as Buzz Aldrin with whom Neal will share his history making Apollo eleven moment\nThere were points in first man when the disjointed and is the filmmaking drove me to a distraction the leaps forward in time the which he close ups the stubborn refusal to let us get our bearings but after a while those surface ruptures begin to make dramatic and psychological sense\nYou come to understand what it must have been like to be Armstrong thrown from one hurdle to the next navigating endless chaos losing friends and colleagues plenty of course to the moon driven by little more than ... flights of risk an instinct\nFinally July Nineteen sixty nine arrives inches el stages the moon landing with the stillness and ... that feels like both an antidote at an answer to all the proceeding chaos its sequence of hushed an otherworldly grander that demands to be seen an ibex is possible\nFor several minutes we really do seem to have left the planet earth behind transport it to a landscape of dust desolation and wonder some dust was stirred up shortly after first manned premiered at the Venice film festival\nWe're journalists noted that the movie didn't show the U.S flag being planted on the moon's surface effect that quickly through fire from conservative politicians\nIn fact ... does show the flag after it's been planted he just doesn't treat the planting itself as a combination point\nHe takes the moon landing in achievement that might have been played for easy triumph and turns it into one man's solemn personal reckoning with all the sorrows failures sacrifices and convictions that have brought him to this extraordinary moment\nWe may not truly know Neil Armstrong buy movies and but we know that his one small step

come out releasing new phones in gadgets hoping you'll send some holiday gift buying dollars their way or more likely perhaps be unable to resist buying a new toy for yourself with Google's hardware announcements this week I suppose you could say the fall unveiling season is almost a rap so what are we looking at here\nThis year the big news isn't just a better camera or a bigger screen it's\nPrice tech expert Omar guy August says buyers are due for a bit of sticker shock or last say they're Omar David let's begin with watch actually knew this fall Google's got a new what pixel three phone which I guess was the worst kept secret in tech right\nYeah we're we're getting to a point where there's really no surprises that these big tech conferences ... everything leaks everything comes out beforehand but what what's interesting about Google's new phones of pixel three and the pixel three excelled a larger one is just price increases and it was seen this across the board with apple with a Samsung\nWith Google Now just you would think these gadgets would get cheaper over time and they are actually getting more expensive especially in the smartphone area\nWhy do you think that is is it just they realize we're addicted because as you I mean you're right I mean the the the standard law technology is smaller cheaper faster cheaper and not so much\nYeah I mean we talked about this when the iPhone has a new iPhones came out is that a lot of it is at the the the wireless carrier subsidies are going away so much more people are buying the phone outright for and when you do that you know it you've got to pay a lot for that phone up but\nAlso a lot of it especially with apple and Google and to have those that they can you know people are willing now to spend more than a thousand dollars for a top of the line new flagship ... well you know they\nCan but not without getting sometimes a black guy I mean you remember when apple released its one thousand dollar phone the iPhone ... yeah and so I I mean it seems like a despite all that negative press as sort of doubled down on that the shooter\nYeah there was a lot of ... probably for me when I came out about a thousand dollar phone uh but people still bought it that's the thing is that apple can continue to get away with this and sell these phones and people will still buy them and what Apple's doing now is people are there's kind of a two things one is that\nSome people are keeping their phones a lot longer you still have people walking around with iPhone five and iPhone sixes and then there's people like me who need to buy the new one every year or are run an upgrade plans so you have that split in the market or an apple is trying to find ways to set make more money from each phone rather than selling more phones\nYou know I I get that when it comes to the high end their appreciable differences but if you're not talking about the high end you know you're not talking about that thousand dollar latest thing from from apple for example\nA ... he's a really an appreciable difference between some of the like the H. T. C. phones or some of these other brands\nAre generally the the improvements that we're seeing like like with these new Google phones is generally going to be with the camera they're going to take you know have new camera features or they might have more memory if you're you know you're getting cramped in space on your phone you know that's a good reason to upgrade but generally know we kind of plateaued on the big kind of blockbuster features so now a lot of it is very kind of minor incremental changes like\nYou know say you you might have an older person that doesn't do wireless charging or you might have a phone that doesn't have to camera lenses on the back of these are kind of the changes that were seen 'em but you know\nThey're all also offering you know last year's model or like a cheaper version like apple with the iPhone or ex are which is going to be like a cheaper version of these new phones\nWell yeah maybe that's a a an option if you were a don't want to uh spring for the for the expensive versions a Microsoft came out with a bunch of surface devices and I think that's surprised a lot of folks it almost seemed like they had ever given up on the surface but no\nUh no Microsoft still sounds very well especially with apple kind of lagging behind a little on its laptops and and you know it hasn't really given a lot of love to it's hard to it's computer line and the way it does with his opponent tablets\nBut or the other thing is Microsoft is also kind of charging a lot of money for some of these devices they have a studio to computer a desktop computer they came out with that starts at thirty five hundred dollars up to forty eight hundred dollars that sounds like apple pricing yeah and when when you read the reviews it's like this is an amazing you know any designer would love to have this computer but you can't afford it\nBut you can't afford it right so ah I Do consumers need to spend all this kind of money I mean are there not a reasonably priced alternatives out there\nNo absolutely not I mean there was a big resale market I mean there are sites like ... you know they use phones that use tablets and computers [noise] ah it's been really the strategy is to by last year's model that's really you know to get the most bang for your buck you're going to want to not by the the latest and greatest but maybe last year's version that is almost as good but maybe half the cost we're\nAlmost at a time but I have to ask you about another gadget that's getting a lot of attention this week Facebook Portal\nYeah everybody's trying to get into this market that Amazon has sort of pioneered with Alexa and with their Amazon Echo show which is sort of like Alexa but with the screen\nSo now Facebook has this message or chatting device that sits on your on your counter that that has a screen a Google Home hub is the kind of the same thing but without the camera so really they are trying to do this kind of voice command thing but\nVisually where you actually have a scream to back it up yeah some people are a little freaked out by that spring but you know you want to Facebook camera if you're out there that question you can find tech expert Omar guy guy at tech minute Texas dot com or get to see again we'll talk to you again next week found thanks for having me David coming up on thirty nine minutes ask our\nSupport to standard kept him TCU hard frogs to try to be the leaders in global citizen\nFeel empowered to save the world terminating Ryan is\nMore ... lead on dot TCU dot edu TCU\nSupport comes from the parade of homes a trivia so featuring houses by Austin's custom home builders workshops and industry tips October Nineteen through November for tickets and details at parade of homes Austin dot com\nYou are tuned into community supported public radio from UT Austin K U T Ninety point five in K.

in the Florida Panhandle continue to evaluate its impact images show some communities utterly leveled the death count at last check stood at twelve but that's expected to rise\nAfter other recent storms like Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico and Harvey here in Texas we're seeing that the official casualty counts don't always add up indeed a storm death in one state might not be counted as such in another so right Sheri Fink a correspondent for the New York times why does it matter these differences in what qualifies as a storm related that\nIt matters from an individual level because survivors in at federally declared disaster can be entitled in some cases to funeral assistance so it can have an impact on you know that person's loved ones all the way to how officials prepare for disasters how\nPublic health officials try to keep people safe\nAfter disasters that's the importance of keeping track of these things have understanding why it is that people die\nSo that hopefully can intervene and and prevent those deaths and future disasters\nBut I suppose there's also it has to be admitted a political dimension here too as we've seen in the aftermath\nOf Puerto Rico well\nAbsolutely uh it it had this number of the death count has become extremely political because the long held death toll was sixty four and\nThen public health research you know looking at statistics showed that close to three thousand more people die than\nWould have been expected otherwise so that was a real you know a big big big Gulf between official numbers and what we think actually happened\nSo let me understand why it is that there isn't a consensus on how you count deaths in the wake of a storm a surely there would be federal guidelines I mean the Centers for Disease Control\nCorrect there are some federal guidelines they were put out last year after Hurricane Maria based on on you know a convening lots of experts to look at this issue but this is a long held problem that goes back many years and researchers had been writing about it for many years\nSo this new guide that the CDC put out is an attempt to get right to the very person who fills out the death certificate and help them understand\nFor purposes of keeping track of these things let's have everybody do this in a standard way\nAnd here's the big issue I think we can all understand what I Do wrecked storm death is right is what we're seeing today with people who were killed when the wind split and a tree fell on them or\nYou know very tragically all the people who are going out and driving into floodwaters and drowning outweigh that tricky part is what they're calling so called a indirect deaths so this could be somebody who they rely on oxygen and they couldn't get their oxygen or\nA you know they were having a heart attack but an ambulance couldn't get to them and so what the CDC has recommended that those be counted as storm deaths too but currently those are typically nest\n[noise] so um you ... you spoke with a Harris County medical examiner's office in Houston and of course they received a lot of attention certainly in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey\nDid they explain what their policy rationale was toward toward the use of the CDC guidelines\nDid I went back to the Harris County medical examiner's office and said now that this\nAnd he the guy does out are you going to change how you look at these\nIndirect deaths they said no we need to keep doing things the way we've been doing them if you listen this definition\nWhere's the line and so we'll just make sure that all that information on you know from our investigations are are in somebody's records and then unfortunately though if if it's not recorded on somebody's\nDeath certificate if the storm itself or the natural disaster or human disaster in the case of terrorist attack and that's not mentioned on a death certificate it becomes harder for officials\nTrying to go through statistics to really detect the relationship and so at all does have to start with the individual coroner medical examiner or doctor and I found that just everybody I spoke to for this article had a different way of thinking about it\nTallying the dead wires storm death and once they might not count in another it's a very thought provoking a article by Sheri Fink who is a correspondent for the New York
