to\nThirty three minutes past the hour Texas standard time I'm David Brown few cities in Texas most to history is rich and storied as the one we're coming to you from today San Antonio one reason for that is just how long it's been around this year marks the city's three hundredth birthday\nIt's an opportunity to Charlie Miller took two by writing a book\nThat spans San Antonio's entire existence it's called San Antonio try centennial history Miller is a former professor at trinity University He now teaches at Pomona College professor Miller thanks so much for taking a few minutes to talk with us on the Texas standard thank you\nYou've been studying San Antonio's history for a long time for a while you were working on this book was there anything that you came across it sort of surprised if\nThere were a lot of things David that surprised me and the fact that I was surprised also worried me like I Lived in San Antonio for twenty six years how come I didn't know X Y and Z but actually also loved that part of what the book does is try to expose other elements outside of the Alamo he's\nNow that really shaped it's like\nWell you know as as funny that you should mention that because I Do think that you're you're onto something it's almost as if people think of San Antonio's history is beginning right around Eighteen thirty six or so\nWell that is how most history books tend to go rights and so part of the reason for writing three hundred years was obviously the the gimmick of the celebration of the centennial\nBut that really allowed me to dig back deep into actually the sixteen hundreds or to think about what it meant before San Antonio was a city that the Spanish developed\nTo give credence to and pay all marched to uh the ... and other native bands that lived in that space and why they lived in the space the way they did and that really set up the book because it helped me understand one of the surprising things that I knew but didn't\nWas how much this city was born of violence the violence not only of the pond Apache McMahon cheese roaring down the plane to attack the Spanish ... caught in the middle of that conflict were the native peoples that had made the space their own but only to find that that space was now in conflict and\nFrom that point on until really post civil war or San Antonio with a pretty violent place as various groups fought literally fought a to gain control over it and blood at times floated in the streets float in the reverse is quite appalling in retrospect\nWhy is it uh do you think that this particular place became that cross roads for conflict was it was it a particularly desirable piece of land what what what was it about this area\nWell some of it has to do with the environment and that's another one of the themes in the book is to look at the space literally the terrain washed the rivers flow through its see its relationship to the hill country to the southern plains\nUm and to remember that natural systems really guide the way in which human beings own a place and how they live in a place and so I think some of that ... have to do with those environmental factors some of it had to do with\nThe way in which the Spanish nestled themselves into that river valley and ultimately built a series of missions their very presence of which\nLed various people to think well if those infrastructure is there than we'd get to fight over that infrastructure and I think that's part of what the Alamo was the Alamo here it's the fact\nOf fat thing being there that gives it a almost a destination battleground let's go fight over that place because it's there\nAnd and it's true before the Alamo in thirty six as it would be afterwards um and so it's a really interesting dynamic where nature obviously rules a lot of these choices and challenges yeah but then human beings build on top of it and you start to see these layers unfold\nYou know I feel a special bond or the city and I can't quite figure out why but it was one of those issues I always want a scratch where when I get a chance to come to San Antonio I Want to go see something I haven't really had a chance to see before experience something I haven't\nUh I Wonder since you now completed this three hundred year overview of San Antonio any suggestions before we leave town\nWell one of the things that I remember sort of in in its in Kuwait stage where it's all of this conversation about the river and its extension south of long missions and north up to the museum and I've walked apart from the museum's downtown\nWhat I haven't done is the south reach 'em and that's a more um from what I can tell from friends who do it regularly it's much more\nLess tourists and much more local um and I think that would be the place I Would go\nJust to walk it in part because walking is such a great way of the things that you can't see by car and I think that's where you begin to see the way in which the city is starting to return to the river and that's one of the themes in the book also which is for many years it was a flood control channel\nIt's now becoming much more of a communal space and that communal mess of it it's really exciting\nChar Miller is a former professor at trinity University He now teaches at Pomona College and he's the author of\nSan Antonio at price in history professor Miller thanks so much

the last\nDeployment is they had let these guys are work the way they had in the past there they're not letting them out to the field\nThey're not letting them horse multiply they're they're keeping them in the back so they're they're really not able to get out and and do what we need them to do\nNow let me ask you that the president has characterized this caravan as an invasion do you see it that way\nYou know I I I don't know if the ... the right word I can understand where he's coming from now you know I ... you know and I guess and it says it is an invasion um let me think about it you have eaten you know two for five ten thousand folks just just storming across and and you know they haven't come across yeah here but we did see the film across\nThe bridge in southern Mexico and they're just taking what they want and what that is just hey we want to come in and were coming in now whether you like it or not um that's not what the rule of law said you just can't\nCome on in and do what you want I mean these guys need people anybody that comes in our country especially if they're going to be here for an extended period a medical screening any that their health screening how are you going to support yourself there there's many different factors that come in with immigrating to our country you just can't just come in and take it that's just not the way things are done here well\nSpeaking of the way things are done here I think that something that the mayor ... was concerned about was you know that sort of tactics enforce these troops would be authorized to use I mean and just how militarized these troops would be I mean I hear you talking about you know getting medical attention for those crossing the border um illegally\nAre you concerned about the militarization of of the border if you have troops staring down a a would be migrants with a with guns\nYou know I can understand that um I I Know when we first started we started getting now National Guard troops and they you know that that question well you know what's gonna happen you guys are used to do anything to a different way and I was in the military so I understand why you know people see it that way as\nYou know what are they going to do you you know when when they come across something but at the end of the day the these these young men and women in the in the service they're they're highly trained 'em they're they're they're good folks there\nYou know a ... and and I haven't seen anything to make me believe that that something would go a ride with having troops down there\n... are you concerned about the politicization of the border here I mean is this more politics than than practical help\nYeah it it's all politics it's one hundred percent politics and that's the problem with it um for instance I'll give you a quick for instance a couple\nOf months back we had people coming down to our areas and telling us that the um the the whole facility processing centers where we're not see camps and and child penitentiaries and it was a shame that we should be ashamed of ourselves\nA and it was a I think it was a congressman from California being a congressman was in two thousand eight\nUm the facility went up a two thousand fourteen she didn't have a problem and two thousand fourteen hundred Democratic president but now Republican president\nIt's a Nazi kept 'em and nothing will get fixed nothing will ever get fixing immigration system as long as people keep thinking Democrat Republican and I don't mean to say it's one party or the other it's both are both parties are at fault for this both parties in Congress are are at fault and they need to take off their their\nTheir their partisan cap would it aside and\nIn a big problem if they can't do that then they need to step aside and let somebody\nAh in who will do that because at the end of the day what we're looking at regardless of what side of this immigration debate you stand out whether it's not a man keep 'em out yes no whatever a lot of young innocent children are being harmed by this they're falling victim to\nChild predators along the way to the heat related injuries ... it to say and if if people care about these young when trying to come across are being sent by their parents to come across that we need to fix this problem because if not we are going to see more harm young ones along the way\nAre
