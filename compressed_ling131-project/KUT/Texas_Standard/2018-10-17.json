that led to weeks of protest in in many quarters outrage before it was rolled back but now White House officials say they're considering reinstitute ... family separations at the border all be if they say\nWith changes Nick Miroff got the story for the Washington Post where he covers immigration and borders Nick welcome to check the standard\n... what do you what is the Trump Administration considering here and what\nI think they're looking at a whole range of options but the one being discussed um that we wrote about is what they called binary choice\nAnd that would involve um keeping families in detention uh up until the twenty they limit that is allowed by the courts but that's the amount of time that children can be held in an immigration jail I'm setting and then at that point presenting the parents with the option of either\nWaving the child's right to be released\nAnd remaining as a family in detention\nUntil the until they're um immigration claims are fully process or allowing their child to be released into the custody of health and Human Services into one of these shelters that we've all read about and that uh would involve obviously the separation of the family\nSo why did they think that this policy is going to be more palatable are acceptable given I mean we we we all ... recall the outrage of ah of last June\nWell they're looking at um a some recent court decisions I'm particularly surrounding the litigation that followed I'm a family separation measures this spring including\nA decision by a federal judge in in San Diego I'm who essentially said that the government um did have the right to present parents with that choice um and you know the thinking here ah for the government is that\nThey want to keep the adults in particular in detention and they want you know they they believe that um too many migrants are essentially using children as a way to come into the United states and avoid being held in custody and once they're\nA forced to release them from custody um you know they they say that it's almost impossible to get them back and it's a way for people to remain in the country illegally so they're using children as a kind of\nThere with their own children in this case as a ticket to to get into the country and I'm kind of go underground\nSo if there were an option for families to stay together where would these families actually go I mean we're talking about the tension centers or were these tent like structures like in tornado Texas well\nThat's a big question I mean I'm you know they do not have that attention as the whole the quantity of families that are arriving each month I'm In August last a month for you know which we have statistics for that was nearly Thirteen thousand family members\nSo keep in mind right now the government's current capacity for what they call family residential centers these are like these are like detention centers there that are essentially approved for children they only have the capacity combined capacity of about three thousand bats so three thousand bed and you're getting\nYou're getting at least a twelve Thirteen thousand new people coming every month so where are they going to put them that's that's a big unknown one of the things you know we know that if that is it the homeland security department is ask\nThe Pentagon to um you know to for permission and and for for help um creating temporary detention camps um you know and so we could see like a family a version of a of toward neo as um as you guys know which is like you know essentially a a\nA camp and or a desert like you know setting where folks are sleeping in you know intense and things like that\nWere at a time but I have to ask timeline as anyone saying when this could happen\nThere they aren't um but obviously the White House is eager to act and and the numbers keep going up and right now we ... you know there's just this morning we see the president tweeting about a a new caravan of families coming up through Central America threatening to cut off aid to hunger so this is clearly at the top of his mind\nNick Miroff covers immigration enforcement for the

Larry the morning\nSo Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to them any individual such as they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tests that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for kids but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of cause I hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to terrorists told me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important than different pairs and one pair we asked about was what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining good relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies is more important than protecting us jobs\nA by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods but I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every country that means the ones that we are close to Canada the western Europe et cetera\n[noise] All right Larry within president of editing research

falls which is where you were there were a lot of people who are saying that they were rather surprised by the rapid rise because it didn't seem like the rain was coming down a particularly heavily\nThat's right and that's the thing to remember about this flood hum it it wasn't a flood of where you know marble falls in two thousand seven they had this event they called the rain bombs like massive amounts of rain Warren right on this community flooding creeks um there were fatalities on the roads this flood was different it was a lot of rain\nUp river in Atlanta river in the base and that feeds that river I see that water comes down the river\nAnd then enters the Colorado River which in marble falls a lot of people that are considered to be a lake lake ... um it's actually the Colorado River and so that kind of a wall of water is just rushing down the river and you have this river flooding and then it's what we're seeing is that water coming down\nHitting these communities and then also hitting these reservoirs that are controlled by the house the IRA they're kind of like buckets along the Colorado River where\nThey all see alright the lower Colorado River authority is what we're talking\nAfter I think that if you had to this is the uh the the kind of state agency that controls these reservoirs along the river and and what they're doing now what we're seeing is it there are allowing the water to pass through these various reservoirs which again a lot of people here think of his legs right hum\nAnd uh allow that wanted to pass in a way that it's a can can kind of get through the river by perhaps not cause a ... and much flooding along the way\nSo what we're really talking about are the mechanics of managing this flow of water that's I mean that's that's what we're experiencing in large part of the hill country right now\nThat's exactly right David and and they have a kind of a limited capacity to do that because many of these reservoirs weren't created\nFor fun control they were created for maybe agricultural use a but lake Travis does have what they call a flood pool which is kind of an extra amount of space to contain access water of course like Travis now is a long pass capacity\nIt it is how much of a surprise is this is this something that we can expect to see more of in the future\nI'm Glad you asked that question because it's it's kind of a big coincidence but just in the last month the NOAA\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nYou David um they just released a new for a kind of a flood\nMap of Texas said it's
