countries\nCongress is going to have to weigh in at some point or no [noise] yeah\nThat's exactly right so the agreements supposed to be signed within the next sixty days by all of the administrative branch is the executive branches of the three countries but then the United States Congress has to ratify it and congressional leaders that said that they're not planning on ratified you're considering it until next year\nSomething that a lot of folks have a have been concerned about is a steel tariffs is there any mention of what might happen now or any sense of what might happen now with those steel tariffs\nOr Canada in particular was hoping that now that we have an agreement this will mean that will be able to the United states would reduce those tariffs towards Canada Mexico but uh that's still up in the air\nPresident Trump is obviously claiming this was a major victory how do you see it in terms of a win for Mexico and Canada for this to be an agreement that's going to have any your ability of course they've got to see this as a something good for themselves to\n[noise] well that's exactly right I think Mexico actually was able to increase the amount of\nProducts and pray and products that they were producing which made them more comfortable with increasing that domestic counter or crime it we talked about and I also think Canada realizes that were your number one trading partner and so having this agreement with absolute critical I think for the Canadian economy\nRaymond Robertson is professor and chair in economics and government in the department of

sure do appreciate [noise] any time it's always a pleasure thanks for him [noise]\n[noise]\nWell according to the calendar it's been a little over two years since Texas' campus concealed carry law went into effect in by the looks of things now it's likely to stay\nIn August a federal appeals court threw out a lawsuit by three professors from the University of Texas at Austin who had argued that the law stifles free speech but has the law had any measurable effect on the state's college campuses uh Houston Public media's Florian Martin wanted to find out\nFirst I was wondering if there's any way of knowing how many students are bringing guns to campus so I checked right here at home with the University of Houston police department there'd be no way for us to know that because we don't ask the question Brett Collier is the acting captain for you HPD's patrol division they do have one indicator\nHow many people leave their firearms with the campus police because they're planning to be in what's called the exclusion zone\nUniversities to designate certain zones on campus were guy\nThese are not allowed at UH that includes science labs storms the daycare facility and sporting facilities\nAmong others [laughter] sorry exchange\nCollyer shows me where students can surrender their gun\nThat will bring out a a safe so you know small safe or some print so they get to put their thumb print in put\nDevice in the box and then we'll take it to the back and start\nThere have been thirty one request the store a firearm at UH pd\nBut that still doesn't tell us how many students overall our arms so I called up the student to advocate for the right to take guns onto college campuses Quinn Cox's with students for concealed carry in studies accounting at the University of Texas at Austin you wouldn't say whether or not he is carrying\nThat's the beauty of concealed carry um is that you know no matter where you go it's it's concealed or no one's no one's going to know\nBut his group came up with an estimate for how many Texas students carry on campus the group you stayed up from concealed carry license for which you have to be Twenty one or older to qualify\nFrom basically Twenty one twenty three the uh licensure rates in the Kerry rates there you know as compared to how often other people carry and we've determined that it's a little bit above ... percent of the student population that his license to carry now whether they carry or not we have no way of knowing that\nNo way of knowing because there's so little research there was a twenty eleven study by for researchers that Sam Houston State University\nIt estimated that at least Eighteen percent of classrooms would have at least one arm student Michael Kavanaugh as one of the researchers you now teaches criminal justice CJ for short at the University of Houston downtown he says the results very significantly by building\nOne of the interesting findings was that the CJ building that Sam Houston had the highest number of people that would carry right it just made logical sense the art building had the lowest number of people that would carry\nKavanaugh suspects the overall numbers to be higher now that the laws actually in effect either way has there been any kind of effect on safety negative or positive Kavanaugh says there have been very few incidents state wide\nRight when the law was implemented they had a couple of incidents I think that there was one at ... state of a gun going off and then for the last two years I mean there's it's really been pretty silent\nThere have been a few more minor incidents in the past year a gun went off accidentally in a dorm room at Texas a and M. and at UT Austin pistols were found in women's restrooms but the lack of violent incidents doesn't tell the whole story says Hanna Shearer an attorney with the Giffords Law Center to prevent gun violence\nI think it's the impact of students not applying and professor is not ... because they don't want to be in a situation where they have to allow guns in the classroom\nShearer says guns on campus might only increase the risk of suicide and she worries what confusion could result if there weren't active shooter on campus but two years after it took effect there was a little hard data to assess the impact of Texas's campus carry law in Houston I'm Florian Martin for the Texas standard

confirm him in her estimation she said they would find some way to justify or minimize what he did\nMeanwhile in Dallas Linda hill says I Will say this if judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI that he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court but not to be on the court that he's on right now is interesting\nTo see how these votes are wavering as we move up to the end

state had been under some form of either dry conditions or some form of drought and\nThat really helped me to alleviate the dryness\nLondon authored the most recent drought monitor report on Texas only about twenty percent of the state is experiencing some level of drought now compared to almost forty eight percent just three months ago and she says more rain is ahead\nSo we're expecting to see

much for joining us on the standard\nWas my pleasure thanks for having me on\nWhat role did Nixon play in shaping the mission to space program\nWell after uh the the Soviet Union launched neck in Nineteen fifty seven in the U.S was trying to figure out how to respond and the real question was whether it should be led by the military are led by some civilian space agency\nUm that didn't yet exist and sort of came down to President Eisenhower calling a meeting in February Nineteen fifty eight and the vice president was there and the president was leaning toward a military led action that was his background\nUm the military the army and navy had missile programs already underway and\nIt was actually Nixon and the president's than new science advisor a guy named James ... who said wait wait wait no\nLet's think about this works let's let's say we're trying to win hearts and minds of Americans of people around the world it would be a nice contrast\n'em for the United states to have a program kind of out in the open you know non military peaceful purposes using space and so you would have the Soviet clandestine military program in the United states we're kind of what became now so\n[laughter] it's it's fascinating to imagine Nixon making that argument especially when you consider his reputation over the years certainly a during and after his presidency he was seen as someone who was\nAnything but transparent but here he is in Nineteen fifty eight making the case for NASA that a while retaining its military options I suppose and its applications nonetheless is a ... is trying to present itself as being opened and for the good all of all mankind\n[noise] yeah I think you know for all of his personal flaws and Nixon certainly had many and and his presidency came through an egg nominees and I think you know his his political instincts are are pretty good and and here he saw you\nKnow opportunity because if you think about you put yourself in United States ... back in the Nineteen fifties and sixties the country was behind the Russians in space you know they were doing all of the interesting thing and so this was a way to differentiate the United states and and sort of put it back\nOn a certain level above the Soviet Union at least in terms of morals\nWell do you say in your piece for our technical that uh this argument about having NASA as a as a kind of a fixture to benefit everyone is coming back into focus now how so\n[noise] well you know there are some real questions about where now goes this century because the military\nWas not particularly happy and I ... and it hasn't been since that that the civil agency came in and and took over human space flight [noise] um so they're they're kind of encroaching on NASA and you've got commercial activities like space sacks and and they're doing interesting things there are encroaching on NASA and so there's\nThere's a real question of what the space agency should do in the coming decades but\nYou know the fact of the matter is that no one else really land probes on Mars no one else sons spacecraft the outer solar system no one has flown back to do all these kinds of interesting things and so you know and that's it still has a a future in an expiration\nUm it's just it it's got some issues both from the military interest and and then on the commercial side well\nI I'll say I mean you think about President Trump's proposal for a space for us for example how does that square with NASA and its say next sixty years\nThat's a great question I think that's something that you know how to be you know work through 'em in coming years NASA you know technically has nothing to do with the space worse it's just it's an air force reorganization that sort of thing but out of that you could see air force astronaut at some point\nUm and kind of an erosion of Nassar's primacy of the center for putting Americans into space\nBut presumably NASA would retain its its mantle as the civilian space program doing science and research in the open while the space wars takes on a military mission\nYeah that that would be the idea certainly\n...
