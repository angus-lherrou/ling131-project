Dylan's state have been working together to help you make sense to them in terms of our Texas to science project inviting listeners to send in their questions and all this week we're answering them today a question about one more spectacular contests driving Texans should polls\nThe Senate race between incumbent Republican Ted Cruz and democratic\nCongressman Beto O'Rourke more for Public Radio's Diana when reports\nYou've probably heard a lot about the Senate candidate Ted Cruz and ... including their stance on immigration health care and the economy but what about\nBeen seen from Michelle many millennials will recognize happened planet environmental issues haven't made a huge role in this race so John ... a retired listening from Plano told that he wants to know\nSpecifically what policies Mitch crews and Mr O'Rourke are for or against to deal with what I perceive most of the scientific community believes is a severe climate problem\nTo answer John's question I recreate professor Robert for best he studies environmental policy at Texas Tech first much like the Senate candidates voting record\nCruz's record em is pretty clear unless it's going to be beneficial for the economy he doesn't really voter pro environment agenda and for all wrong it's pretty clear he votes along the lines of just about everything that's good\nFor the environment Aurora said he's for rejoining the Paris climate accord and getting more oversight to the environmental protection agency the league of conservation voters and environmental advocacy group has tracked congressional members votes on environmental bills through twenty Seventeen\nThe organization has given Ted Cruz a great if three percent for his entire career in battle rock in Ninety five\nAnd surprisingly the LCD has endorsed O'Rourke in this race but\nI can see where he's not really talking a lot about the environmental issues because I mean in a sense given the conservative nature of Texas voters that could harm in\nTexas is the land of oil and gas after all\nWe learned a lot more in last week's debate where Cruz ... finally got a chance to talk about their stances on climate change in a column civil manner\nIs dishonest twenty resident called them wind it's clear Congress about Iraq's pollsters have told them to come out on the attack\nThe moderator asked Senator Cruz what he tells energy companies I Believe climate change is a serious problem\nThe climate has been changing from the dawn of time to climate will change as long as we have a planet\nEarth cruise reference twenty Fifteen hearing he helped challenging that climate change is caused by human activity\nWe heard testimony we heard actual science and data\nAfterwards he says he remained unconvinced O'Rourke disagrees\nMan made climate change is a fact three hundred years after the enlightenment\nWe shouldn't be able to listen to the scientists\nRoute through this time in office in during the debate he kept hitting from climate to the Texas economy like this chat do roar\nHe's a prominent supporter of President Obama's Paris climate deal which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas\nLast year the Senate or pushed for President Trump to pull out of the Paris Agreement to reduce the world's carbon emissions and was supported by energy giants like Exxon Mobil but Republicans that disagreement with a bad deal for Americans in general Cruz's first priority is to keep attacks US Economy booming\nAnd not economy currently relies heavily on the oil and gas industry in last week's debate O'Rourke said he aimed to change that very economy\nWe can support Texas being a proud energy leader in oil and gas but also in renewable energies we can continue to grow this economy we can reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy\nSo that's the candidate Texas voters actually think that the rubber for bats actually had a student at Texas Tech asked people just that they did a survey of voters and loving asking whether or not they favored moving away from fossil fuels towards renewables\nThose persons who self identified as Republicans were pretty conservative county um we're almost on line one one with the self identified Democrats and their preference for moving is far away as possible from fossil fuels and towards renewable an alternative\nFrom his environmental policy perspective for moving toward alternative energy is ultimately good protect the business in the long run and he does think this all will become a pressing topic for voters in Texas\nHe says as jobs in hurricane to become more severe in the state more people become personally affected and then start caring more about issues like climate change in the environment for our question to ask her John Gergen it's already at the top of his last\nI knew everybody wants to live a long life everybody wants to take care of their children and grandchildren and we all want clean

among his many titles\nHe's also one of the organizers of this event Dr ... welcome back to protect your standard absolutely as privileged to be here during the conference there's a big focus on the next legislative session that kicks off just a few months from now in January why the legislative session when you're all about fixing things that the community level that we are interested\nIn trying to move at the community level but it really takes all of us if we want to improve health here in the state of Texas is not just the academic community or the local health departments are but we have that policymakers and involved in it is a policy sets environment a lot of the the rules and regulations moving it to the health\nBut in fact I was just noting some of these issues is school based nutrition for example a lot of policies dictate how well we fair and in that regard\nI I absolutely ... and so the nutritional standards for daycare\nThe amount of exercise my kids get in a physical education um all those things are set by the legislature let's talk about some of the other issues maternal health has been abandoned or you're in Texas absolutely it's a it's a huge issue we several years ago there was a report that came out that ranked us at the very bottom of the nation\nAnd we've taken a bigger deeper dive into that and the data there were some challenges with a date I recall that that that's still we still aren't doing good a ... especially if you look at where we are doing with African Americans\nAre African American maternal mortality rates twice as high as for white folks is that right that is high prices high end and our overall average in the United states is about twice as high as other developed countries that so we have a lot of work to do\nAnd there's of course disaster recovery and ... and goodness knows I mean with Hurricane Harvey alone not to not to mention many other incidents that we've faced here in Texas\nYes absolutely we uh because of our location because of our size that there are always every year a event of national consequence that that a cursor on tax will I mean\nWe just talked about three things right there\nUm there's so much to go through I mean how do you cut through\nNot just the the the ... the enormity the scale of what there is to to address but misinformation too which is also a big part of of of of many of these issues\nThere is misinformation what we've seen that especially on the vaccine front misinformation um become a flaw studies or in the past and no vaccines are safe and I give it to my kids but but that's kind of misinformation we have to take care of\nTheir other policy issues you know and I think of the session I think of policy and finance and so there'll be issues related to obtain the funds for mental health for the state health department and the variety of areas but also policies such as on the maternal\nHealth issue um right now women are only on Medicaid for sixty days after delivery and I think a lot of us think that we need to continue that for a full year because of all the issues that have been brought up related to maternal\nMorality but isn't it true that a lot of this gets down to at least as if you're thinking about policy and bringing lawmakers into the picture a lot of it is how you got to pay for it I mean this is a no income tax state right and it's it's one of the big attractions ah some politicians say\nAbsolutely and I think a lot of these activities as we keep people healthier pay for themselves in a lot of us we're talking about trying to make state agencies tobacco free the state pays for the lung cancer the heart disease all those things that occur because of tobacco\nSo what you're describing here is a achieving big efficiencies I suppose you could say\nYeah absolutely I I think increasingly business is looking at these issues and so as they understand that a big chunk of their bottom line is determined by healthcare costs they are deciding whether the low paid into certain communities based on the health of those communities and so we need to improve overall community health\nNow as I understand that you'll be speaking to students about career paths in public health ... where should students be focusing their energy in the state of Texas says you see\nI think there's a lot of opportunities in public at right now about Eighteen percent of the gross national product goes into health care ... there's a lot of jobs there there's a lot of good jobs into training people how do you work across communities how do you use the data how do you do program management quality improvement\nIf a student can develop those skill sets I think it will be very effective not only public health than in state agencies are in the

Bush he also has big connections in media he's the chief political analyst for ABC News anti founder of the movement of his own country over party\nDowd wants to see the emergence of third parties and or the evolution of current one\nThere's this psychological problem right now which is the biggest hurdle to the to getting to where we want to go which is is I got to pick between one of the two you

actually get from simply Democrat versus Republican ... something else in politics down says it'll take a lot of little stats by individuals individuals perhaps like off tonight Preston Waller\nYou can start a movement with a catchy slogan he's just a voter who has long leans Republican but who is frustrated with the current tone\nI can tell you more about what am I vote is not going to a point of steel and best of voting for the candidate as ... ...\nIf you're thinking that seems pretty obvious think about the last time you actually get the same Wallace says he's not happy with the direction that the Republican Party but Democrats listening shouldn't take that as a when\nI think starting in a position that puts you in a different category as others automatically and put people

standard time I'm Deborah few cities in Texas both to history is rich story as the one we're coming to you from today San Antonio one reason for that is just how long it's been around this year marks the city's three hundredth birthday\nShould opportunity that Charlie Miller to do by writing a book which bans San Antonio's entire existence called San Antonio attraction ten year old history Miller is a former professor at trinity University He now teaches at\nPomona College professor Miller thanks so much for taking a few minutes out to talk with us on the drugs are standard thank you you've been studying San Antonio's history for a long time for a while you were working on this book was there anything that you came across\nSo it's sort of surprised there were a lot of things David that surprised me and the fact that I was surprised also worried me like I moved to San Antonio for twenty six years how come I didn't know X Y and Z but actually also loved that\nPart of what the book does is try to expose um other elements outside of the Alamo he's now that really shaped it's like well\nYou know it's funny that you should mention that because I Do think that you're you're onto something it's almost as if people think of San Antonio's history is beginning right around Eighteen thirty six or so\nWell that is how most history books tend to go rights and so part of the reason for writing three hundred years was obviously the the gimmick of the celebration of the centennial\nBut that really allowed me to dig back deep into actually the sixteen hundreds or to think about what it meant before San Antonio ... was a city that the Spanish developed\nTo give credence to and pay Amash to uh the ... and other native bands that lived in that space and why they lived in the space the way they did and that really set up the book because it helped me understand one of the surprising things that I knew but didn't\nWas how much this city was born of violence the violence not only of the loop on Apache matches roaring down the plane to attack the Spanish but caught in the middle of that conflict were the date of peoples that had made this space their own but only to find that that space was now in conflict and\nFrom that point on it until really post civil war or San Antonio was a pretty violent place as various groups fought literally fought a to gain control over it and blood at times floated in the streets floating the reverse it's quite appalling in retrospect\nWhy is it do you think that this particular place became that cross roads for conflict was it was it a particularly desirable piece of land what what what was it about this area\nWell some of it has to do with the environment and that's another one of the themes in the book is to look at the space literally the terrain watched the rivers flow through it to see its relationship to the hill country to the southern plains um and to remember that natural systems really guide the way in which human beings\nOwn a place and how they live in a place and so I think some of it have to do with those environmental factors some of it had to do with\nThe way in which the Spanish nestled themselves into that river valley and ultimately built a series of missions\nThe very presence of which led various people to think well if those infrastructure is there then we get to fight over that infrastructure and I think that's part of why the Alamo was the Alamo here it's the fact\nOf fat thing being there that gives it a almost a destination battleground let's go fight over that place because it's there\nAnd and it's true before the Alamo in thirty six as it would be afterwards um and so it's a really interesting dynamic where nature obviously rules a lot of these choices and challenges yeah but then human beings build on top of it and you start to see these layers unfold\nYou know I feel that special bond or the city and I can't quite figure out why but it was one of those issues I always want a scratch wreck when I get a chance to come to San Antonio I Want to go see something I haven't really had a chance to see before experience something I haven't\nUh I Wonder since you've now completed this three hundred year overview of San Antonio any suggestions before we leave town\nWell one of the things that I remember sort of in in its in Kuwait stage where all of this conversation about the river and its extension south of long missions and north up to the museums and I've walked apart from the museum's downtown\nWhat I haven't done is the south reach 'em and that's a more um from what I can tell from friends who do it regularly it's much more\nLess tourists and much more local um and I think that would be the place I Would go\nJust to walk it in part because walking such a great way to do things that you can't see by car right and I think that's where you begin to see the way in which the city is starting to return to the river and that's one of the themes in the book also which is for many years it was a flood control channel\nIt's now becoming much more of a communal space and that communal mess of it is really exciting\nChar Miller is a
