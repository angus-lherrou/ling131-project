cut down and say ... is the state of Tamaulipas which is just south of us here in Texas\nTony when was the last time Texas experienced a red tide bloom\nIt was in September when we had a red tide bloom occurred here in Texas or a device called a site or bought in the uh in Iran's is a quarter rounds has picked up a elevated numbers themselves I think it was like\nThirty cells in six middle leaders and that's a little bit elevated more than background and so Texas a and M. give gave us a a a heads up\nBut it didn't last long and it moved more north um we only found background down here on south Padre Island but ah we're lucky we are dodged the bullet\nWhat was it what is it that people living along the coast actually fear ... which what is the danger that this red tide brings\nIt it's more dangerous for people that that have asthma or or a respiratory problems because the cell contains a neuro toxin called brother toxin and when you breathe it irritates her respiratory system so we\nFree for we warn people with asthma to pretty much stay away from it or stay inside air conditioning and when you do have a heavy bloom or the cells are called an armored ... and they break easily in waves in the surf mhm an aerosol eyes is\nAnd so the aerosol is blown onshore usually if the wind is on shore and people breathe that not that results in in the irritation of the respiratory system but there is no red tide in Texas right now I must say that whenever people here red tide they they think that we're having a blue but we are not in Texas\nSo how did how we become relatively lucky compared with our friends in Florida\nWe were lucky um [noise] you could probably attribute it to several several things um could be the wins the currents um we did have a cold water up well in this summer and red tide like hot\nCalm water and we we did see the the coastal area I guess around corpus and down here\nIn the surf the temperature cool down significantly and that could have inhibited any building that we could have had\nIt's not just the uh harmed or this can do to people who suffer from asthma but we're also talking about massive fish kills at least in the past year in

pelicans hum hum we've seen lots of animals affected by it too\nWell so I Wonder as we look at the situation in Florida you know whether there might be some lessons that we can take away and apply to Texas is there any way that we can preempt a red tide you are in in the future\nI don't think so it's pretty much a naturally occurring event um it is a Korean more frequently lately um I think we've

I was never open for\nAny kind of guardianship or custody proceedings\nNow but still you can see how these sorts of situations might become long term if not permanent separations has that sort of thing happened in which children have been in fact adopted away from their birth parents\nWere one of the things we wanted to do with the story is clean out\nThese holes in the system that essentially allows state court judges to grant\nCustody of migrant children to American families sometimes without notifying their parents\nUm so basically that the children who were\nUnder the care of the office of refugee resettlement or part of this slide piecemeal system where they could end up ultimately being adopted by us families um\nSometimes that is the wish of the children and sometimes that is because they have\nAsked to be adopted by their foster parents or they were trafficking victims for instance\nUm but through talking with Bethany uh we didn't learn that nine of the five hundred\nMigrant children that particular agency has had assigned to it voucher program have been adopted by American families since around ...\nIs hard though not to to talk about this and talk about the recent wave of family separations on the border that obviously made national indeed international headlines what happened after those separations did we see an uptick in the numbers of these kinds of cases\nIs it too soon to know exactly how they have been or will be resolved\nWell it's important to know that none of this happens overnight um kids don't end up in long term foster care and chow\nUm the government has had trouble finding\nA sponsor for them to be released you or in the case of the euro tolerance separation some kids are ending up in long term foster care because the government has decided they're not eligible to be reunified with their parents but um you know I think one of the other things we wanted to point out is that\nExperts well there's the risk is really growing for these kinds\nOf hearings to come before state court judges who just may not be entirely up to speed on how federal custody of migrant children work so it's you know essentially something to watch over time as we\nLearn more about the infants and children and teens who were taken from their families at the border under zero tolerance earlier this year and who remain in the United states\nTo remarkable story told by grants Burke a reporter for the Associated Press thanks so much for sharing some time with this on the Texas standards thank you\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWilson
