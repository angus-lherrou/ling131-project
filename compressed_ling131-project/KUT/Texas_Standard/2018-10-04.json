deal as many people are making it out to be\n[noise] we've been speaking with professor Michael mosques or who specializes in international relations with the University of Texas at Austin professor moss or thanks for joining us on the standard that gave\nWhen he was a master of the Senate LBJ use something called the Johnson treatment and now the Austin American statesman reports the senior senator from Texas is testing out the corn and\nTreatment as he takes the lead role pushing the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh three Republican senators remain holdouts Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska but the stakes in this fight go beyond a confirmation vote Philip bump is national correspondent for the Washington Post welcome\nLike ... ah the fight over Kavanaugh's one thing it's another where control of the Senate stands in the midterms but you write the two shouldn't be seen in isolation one is affecting the other house oh\nWell to be honest we don't know the extent to which one is affecting the other but it's very clear that that the Kavanaugh nomination has very quickly become the most polarizing issue President Trump's presidency which is pretty remarkable thing to say given how ... writes that he's done\nBut they cannot nomination has the biggest splits two Democrats or Republicans that we've seen so far\nAnd the reason why obviously is that this has become a very very partisan fight has become partisan fight Senate come partisan fight nationally\nAnd that as an ad natural eco with in the mid term elections are a lot of Democrats who I see the Supreme Court now is a much bigger issue than they didn't\nTwenty sixteen the Supreme Court according to Research Center is now the key issue for the twenty team elections people are paying a lot of attention to what happens with this fight for a very strong opinions about what happens with this fight that necessarily although it's hard to evaluate how much at this point not necessarily trickles into metrics\nAll right well let's take a look at the state of the Senate as we speak Republicans holder or lead in a fifty a racist or a receipt said democratic caucus holds their leads and forty nine seats according to a uh your reporting here\nSo I Would I'm not clear on is whether or not the Kavanaugh nomination and the battle over that changes in other words shifts a opinion or whether or not it just ... or ... opinion because as we've seen a lot of the Trump supporters are are backing Kevin Oh one hundred percent and we see the same thing on the Democratic side\n[noise] that's right and again it it's hard I mean this is this is the sort of subtle influence on election is pretty hard to evaluate its hard any\nPoll to suss out the extent to which this is an important factor but I think what is important about that law nomination is that it serves as a sport for people to get engaged in the election and this it looks like it's going to be very much a lesson about who turns out and to what extent they turn out I mean that's sounds like I'm being a normal dumb political pundits that says\nIt's really true that election cycle because midterms tend to favor Republicans but difficult incentive for more than Democrats\nThat the Democrats are so energized is the thing that sort of throwing things into disarray and since pollsters are dependent on accurate estimate of who's going to turn out to vote\nIf you influence how many people come out the vote that throws off the polls that's something we saw on twenty sixteen right so the the the challenge here is gauging the extent to which people are going to be so aggravated by the ... not necessarily going to change their whole one or the other one is going to spur them to come out to vote on that otherwise might not\nWell you've been following this for some time so or going with what you see the numbers that you see a and your own sense of the ground how do you think it's looking as we approach midterms\nWell the house is much less a question it seems\nPretty likely the Democrats going to retake the house it's not a certainty in the same with Hillary Clinton the electrolytes I wasn't as good as seeing but it is certainly the case that Democrats are very well positioned both because of how a voters view the Democrats versus Republicans but also just a lot of sort of structural things like\nThe number of Republicans that have given up their incumbency\nAnd not about reelection it's not it's not as much murkier question and the reason is not because on the Senate side people have a less partisan use it's simply a map the Democrat is so that there are more seat currently held by democratic incumbents that are up for re election this year than there are Republicans and that of course the function of the fact that\nSix years ago in those terms started was two thousand call and you're a lot Democrats won in places where they might not otherwise have one so that's why this looks a lot for your for the Democrats my guess is that the Senate ends up probably about split\nOf course when the most interesting Senate races right here in Texas it's one of many Philip bump is watching is national correspondent for the Washington Post willing to his latest Texas standard dot ORG Philip thanks so much my pleasure\n[noise] [noise]\nSocial media editor
