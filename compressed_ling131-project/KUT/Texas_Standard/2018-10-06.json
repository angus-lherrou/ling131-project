{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "You know you you see this play out in Congress and in on the football field and you know in the world of entertainment and I you know I'm not sure of the pendulum just keeps swinging and the more it swings the more polls at the fabric\nIn the center and there's really very little that people are very are willing to agree on a there is no shared set of facts and it makes it very difficult to get\nPeople to believe each other I mean take the cabin up performance at the at his hearing uh for example I mean the fact the matter is going into that how many Republicans in the hallways Kelsey were saying oh you know Dr Ford she was credible and looked like they felt like you know Kavanaugh's nomination might be on the ropes\nAnd yet at all it took was Kevin odd to say you\nKnow to to say hey it's a revenge of the Clintons the Democrats did this on purpose it's a you know it's not well funded machine against me it was\nAll right now and it worked and land it and then everybody went to their corners the only difference is that Republicans still feel the necessity to say that they believe that something terrible happened to Christine Blasey Ford\nThey just believe Brett Kavanaugh at the same time and that seems to me a difficult tight rope to walk but they walked it successfully even Susan Collins walk to successfully today\nThat she was mistaken about who had sexually assaulted her is basically what they're saying that yes she was sexually assaulted but now ...\nAnd that may just be something that the Republican Party as it continues to grapple with and we'll have to figure out where they fall on that over time and it may it may be that they change at the dish in overtime\nTangled saying I Want to bring you in on this what do you think of the cultural moment that's been going on [noise] well I think about it from the perspective of the court [noise] and\nYou know the court which now has three women justices for the first time is through the experience of the female justices able to bring home a lot more\nAh with respect to cases involving sex discrimination sexual assault sexual harassment Sandra Day O'Connor you know first began that change came to the court at a time where you would find the bench not even a women's restroom so the court moves and very very slowly intends to lag behind the culture same sex marriages\nKind of the rare counter example where maybe it led to some extent but I don't see the court\nDoing anything to do what ever associate itself with the culture of grievance that has kind of taken hold this was just said\nI'm a among conservatives is there's a different kind of conservativism it's bought in its it's built on the notion of a a methodology of interpreting the law in interpreting rights but I wouldn't see the court moving in this direction\nPolitically culturally I think probably the worst thing for Brett Kavanaugh is that Saturday Night live cold open which will and for a long time it was so\nClose it was so spot on in a way that it was ... ... ... ... ... it's not gonna it's not one of those things that are just sort of fade into to memory it's going to be around for a long time\nYeah he has to embrace it I think he's got to you know Brett Kavanaugh is a sophisticated guy has been involved in politics for a while has been a judge for a long time understands how the media works and he's going to need to be willing to make a little bit of fun of himself\nAnd be contrite to some extent as I think he has started to be already um in order to kind of get away from the caricature of him that's going to be out there or otherwise and that is likely to really take hold because\nReally that active left uh in the Democratic party I Do think views this as a very strong issue for them both politically but also just as a matter of principle and so you are going to hear his name used\n'em in politics in a very very very harsh way for for a while now\nDo you think there's any chance Nina Totenberg that Kevin or would be impeached\nWell Tom thinks that that's possible I I find it incredible\nI I think it would be the Democrat shooting themselves in the foot you would have to\nIt's true reporters and not going to give up on this story they are going to keep going but you know and Nick here and make their a bar fight here a drunken evening there that's not going to do it some ... there would have to be really hard evidence of perjury well I think\nIt's also just be clear on what the terms of our our here because there's no shot he's actually going to be removed from office well right yeah that really requires the Senate ... ... the Democrats are not going to have that kind of majority\nThe question is will a democratic how have you know will they hold hearings I think it's extremely likely would they go so far as to actually vote out articles of impeachment I think it's much harder because if they do in the house it's going to be quite narrowly and there will be Democrats still in Trump red states so I Would be surprised but I think it's going to go in that direction\nI think it's also important to point out that not only are Democrats likely to get a very narrow majority in the house but they are fighting impeachment fights within their party on multiple levels they they also have a a a number of people in their party who want to impeach the president and they have a ... a larger ...\nThat that there'll be trying to an act and I would imagine that Kavanaugh might not climbed to the top of that\nAnd when I ran into why you saw cabinet I'll do what he did with the wall Street Journal op ed and I agree with Nina that it probably wasn't the best placement of that op ed but regardless\nYou know Lisa Murkowski middle point tonight on the Senate floor in discussing why she would be a no vote a on Brett Kavanaugh even though she's going to vote present because a Steve Gaines has a has a a a ... his daughter's wedding in Montana um\nShe's she cited the judicial ... the code of conduct and in cannon to said that a note judge should ... or a judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and she felt like in her conscience\nThat that wasn't the case with Kevin on now but that's what he's that's the challenge for him going forward is to appear to be that impartial\nJudge okay just a minute left here but I I just want to rap by by asking this President Trump was elected what just about two years ago\nHe has gotten into a trade war with China a he has a made a lot of moves on the environment and rolling back regulations she's done a lot of things that have angered a lot of people but now he has gotten to justice is on the Supreme Court is this Nina so far his biggest legacy\nIs absolutely his biggest legacy and he he was smart enough to know he didn't really know how to do this so he farmed it out to the federalist society which was very shrewd and some people think is a really flaunting the constitution that you're not supposed to farm out something to a private ideological entity\nBut to society knows how to do this they've done is they've helped in a lot of previous confirmation hearings they know how to go through somebody's record and pick up and they picked pretty reliable conservative votes\nIt's only been two years it's only been two years we'll see what happens next\nThat wraps up our deep dive into the nomination of red cabin up thanks to NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina

it's going to end up\nI mean yes there's a lot of jockeying for position there's a lot of rhetoric there's a lot of grandstanding and chest thumping but in the end you know have the votes going to go a most a legislative leaders are are are low so you can call up about if they don't know how and\nSo this has really been unusual because they're actually was some drama right down to the end I I Know I don't know if it's deep down in the heart of hearts a majority leader Mitch McConnell knew that he had a mansion or or or or knew that he had flake\nRight but um that that's what's really been unusual about this entire thing um it it it uh it it they're actually has been suspense\nWe're almost out of time but do you have a sense that people are satisfied with the process so far or ask here as after the Thomas a confirmation proceedings is there a sense that the system's broken\nI don't think anybody satisfied with the way the system uh played out with what's the process worked out um we'll be talking about this and debating this for a year in\nA just like we were with with a Anita Hill I'm ... and both sides have a case to make the uh the Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz and and John Cornyn based a lot of their position that they felt but violated both voted yes which is no surprise\nBut that they were both heavily critical of of Democrats for an interview politicizing the celebrations bringing them up late and so on and then you've got the Democrats who say that they don't think that Christine fourth story really got a fair shake it wasn't adequately investigate it

and we will be reading [noise]\nThanks so much Kevin ... should appreciate [noise]\nGood to be with your daycare [noise]\nA population of Dallas continues to balloon quite the opposite is happening to the number of kids attending Dallas public schools\nNow the second largest school district in Texas is considering an option which the president of the Dallas I as the school board describes as as close as you can get to thermonuclear war and the school business namely mass school closures\nEven Marie ... is an education reporter for the Dallas Morning news she has the story and she joins us now even Marie thanks\nFor speaking with us on the Texas standards hey thanks for having now this plan is I understand it as all talk now nothing set in stone but what exactly are they talking about\nDoing math school closures what does that mean\nLow right now they're looking at how to plan for the future how they went to attract students back to the district and that includes building some new school programs\nBut at the same time they're looking at how to how do they balance enrollment issues that they have they have a number of schools that have low and Romans may be you know fifty percent pool so they're looking at how to best balance that potentially close up to twenty two schools\nOr tell us a little bit about this issue that the Dallas ISD faces in terms of attrition of of of students what's going on\n[noise] well it's a it's a problem that's not uncommon in many urban areas you have families that are moving to the suburbs or you have families that are making other choices and in Dallas many families are choosing to go to charter schools you have about\nThirty four thousand kids who live in the state boundaries that are tending charter schools\nAnd that isn't spread out evenly among the district that's mostly concentrated in the southern part of Dallas so you have a number of campuses and that area that aren't being utilized\nSo if if they are considering the possibility of ... school closures what does mass mean in this context how many schools might actually be closed if they decide to go this route\nThat initial plan looks at closing maybe twenty two schools wow now that is far from final the trustees have to talk about it and look at what the logistics are\nYou are ready they're saying OK well some of this doesn't make sense you have kids that would be crossing you know very busy street or even start route tracks or like Raul tracks so those are options that they know off the bat that they don't want to consider\nBut you know a mess just ease agree that there's going to be some ... talks to try and figure out what exactly they do need to do we've\nHeard a school districts like Houston I asked you in Austin ISD ah consider large school consolidation in the\nPast is this something that Dallas has been mulling over for a while\nYes this is an unusual Dallas recently closed a handful of schools going into the school year and in two thousand twelve a Dallas also closed nearly a dozen schools\nWow a so there's another issue I suppose we should also mention here and and it goes beyond just the numbers of students attending\nIt's that you have a lot of schools that are getting rather long in the tooth\nYes the average age of goals in Dallas tasty it's about fifty one point seven years almost fifty two years and nationwide that looks more like forty four years\nSo it you know they need to do some massive revamped the need to do some upgrades some technology so they're also looking at how to replace him schools and build some schools\nAre obviously they're trying to save some money here but this is going to cost a lot of money too I Would imagine\nA they're looking to maybe pumped in about\nOne to two billion dollars for new facility means to try and open up some new schools and revamp them\nBut they're hoping that that in the long run they can save some money for operations costs by consolidating utilities and campus leadership and things of that nature\nEven Maria ... is following this story is education reporter for the Dallas Morning news will link to her latest of Texas

showdown it's as big as ever this year weather permitting with both teams ranked in the national polls but rather than look at tomorrow's game we're about to engage in a bit of time travel turning the way back machine to Nineteen Ninety nine\nTexas won that match up thirty eight to twenty eight but Oklahoma jumped out to his Seventeen point lead in the first quarter\nWhat was behind that quick start well turns out it was a bit of red iron should cane hurry on an epic scale here to tell us more Jake Trotter he's a college football writer for ESPN Jake welcome to Texas standard yet good to be on what happened in Nineteen Ninety nine it involves\nA what's known in football is a place script and I suppose we should for folks who may not be totally familiar with that term explain what a play script actually is yes so off as the coordinators and play callers and and football at all levels they will\nMap out there for a few plays on a piece of paper and the team will practice um you know the week leading up to the game\nAnd the reason is you know two or three full you know you want to get a rhythm offensively a you ought to maybe ... defense to see\nOkay if we run this play how's that going to light up into\nA that is what a place to every coordinator has one in my late certainly outlawed act yet you are going into the Nineteen Ninety nine game\nOkay let's talk of a for a moment about Mike Leach here because he's the main culprit his reputation and college football I suppose is as something of a rascal to put it mildly at the time he was Oklahoma's offensive coordinator and he's since been head coach at Texas Tech in Washington state\nSo what exactly did he concoct for this Nineteen Ninety nine Red River showdown\nSo he was joking with another assistant coach at Oklahoma week of the game but hey you know it'd be funny you know how could we mess with Texas before the game and\nIt was suggested that what if we came up with the ... place in late it on the field somewhere and and and and maybe Texas would pick it up well\nThat could laugh about it but\nWe decided hey why not do it right out and see how it works [laughter]\nSo we can the game is coming up with this fake place ... there's a lot of new wants in it because he wants to create a script\nShook tech to use it\nThat's going to compliment the plays he's actually going to run so in other words if you gonna run let's let's just keep it simple if you're going to run a sweet to the left on the place scripted would say sleep to the right so that it did you go to the right to play actually goes to the last decade or so uh that was on the other thing is he had to create like\nThe terminology for this script complex enough that it would seem real but simple enough so that excess could get understand\nAny has it laminated but a ... an assistant at Oklahoma or his name at the top and make it look it's official as possible [laughter] and then it goes forward without trying to figure out how to plant the script so that Texas will find it\nSo it has to look like it has accidentally what fallen out of coaches or Oklahoma coaches hands or how did he do that\nThey called a couple of players over before the game and he gives descriptive this guy named ... Smith was a freshman tight knit said here's what I Want you to do I want you to wait a minute walk off\nA didn't didn't go by the Texas since there and like you're jogging and act like you're trying to put this script and your and your pads or your your belt and let it fall but don't act like you do or that it felt like you think you you talk to them properly and then just run up short of\nA student assistant protects us think Casey already thought\nOr he picked it up and he takes the Texas locker and and give it to the defensive coordinator color race who cannot believe that they have found a a a gold mine like this and I can't believe that the break that they've caught\nSo what happens is the game gets started\nOr you can imagine it didn't go very well for Texas state that consulting the script and\nThey think they know used place before they even get their their even run a and\n... goes on to score or another field or the other touched now they're up Seventeen adopted it at that point that just as you know what we an ad we need to get back to what we were planning to do originally uh attacked us was the better team that you're that come back and actually when the game thirty eight twenty eight it was the biggest come back to Texas it it it had\nAn addict completed and thirty four years so\nUh as likely to put it it would have been a lot more legendary head Oklahoma what\nYou know I think a lot of people hearing this tale for the first time may have the same reaction that's cheating isn't it or no I\nYeah I think it falls more under the the gamesmanship of sports than than necessarily cheating I mean it's\nI mean I think even the Texas guy I thought it was funny you know they they think it's funny that time [laughter] yeah they thought it was funny Nineteen years later and they they think it's especially think it's funny 'cause they ended up winning the game and they not won the game then oh my goodness they would have been\nAs my as we age but it uh even more legendary\nDrink ... is a college before a writer for ESPN he's on route to Dallas where are you going to be covering the red river true down this weekend will have a link to his latest affects the standard daughter were Jake thanks for your time [laughter] yeah no problem [noise]\n[noise] what Santa comes from Texas advocating for a safe and positive future contact for children child protection [laughter] volunteer information has become a cop out\nYou're listening to the Texas ...
