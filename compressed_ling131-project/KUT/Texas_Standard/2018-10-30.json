longtime state climatologist professor Nielsen Gammon welcome to Texas standard\nYeah thank you glad to be here I think this is somewhat counterintuitive are a lot of our listeners may sort of wondered\nCould this be real that the number of severe weather I'm a uh situations related to tornadoes and hurricanes has actually been declining how how so [noise]\nWell this year has been at least for for a\nTornado's or a very good year for taxes free ride very few of them\nAre you know normally are severe weather season is primarily April May and\nJune and I think it's just so happened that during this particular year we we did not get\nThe right kind of weather systems that allow that to happen\nThere were these a number of tornadoes um farther north than further East I'm even believe it or not Wyoming is more turnout open Texas around\nUm which we don't mind particularly but I think this is really just a probably a a one off thing we don't really know about\nLong term trends on her because we haven't really been systematically looking for tornadoes until like around the magazine argued fibers are starting to Asian got big so we'll have twenty years' worth of record\nRight

November\nSo do you think that these events are in any way a related or or just a a core related and coincidental\nSo if you look at the big picture actually rainfall overall in Texas has gone up by

unfortunately that's the sweat whether they have the ... the funny thing is probably being enhanced by little warmer temperatures but we've been seeing globally and the change of weather pattern that goes along with that\nAs you pull back and I know you're reluctant to do this but what's the take away from you know fewer tornadoes or an apparent reduction or at least a sort of the status quo when it comes to hurricanes and a whole lot more rain is there\nIs there a way to tie it all together and give us a sense of what we're looking at for the next five or ten years or is just no way\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I think a conversation that kind of clear that you can't make blanket statements about extreme weather climate change doesn't make all extreme weather worse doesn't recall extreme

Brown drive along the highway in Texas is oil country and you've probably seen them\nFlares burning off extra natural gas and oil fields or thirties are supposed to be keeping tabs on this since flaring does have an impact on the environment and of course on policy decisions like promoting alternatives to oil but how much do we really know about the scale of flaring in Texas\nMay be less than we think from the energy capital of the world Travis ... reports on energy and the environment from our partner station Houston Public media Travis welcome back to the standard hey good beer so flaring generally speaking is up any way as you've reported why is that\nBasically there are not enough uh pipelines in the ground in West Texas enough space on those pipelines to move all the gas that is coming up a wind drillers are out there pulling oil out of the ground or get a lot\nOf what's called associated gas this is natural gas that just comes up with it and it's basically a by product it's not really worth anything they're certainly not drilling for the gas drilling for oil that's what they care about and solve this gas comes up they don't have enough infrastructure out there to move it all\nA cause the area's just booming so much and so they wind up a burning it off into the air which is\nOf course environmentally speaking not great it's a waste of you know of products to but it is a better approach than just releasing it into the air which is known as venting a that's a lot more dangerous to the atmosphere\nInteresting okay so I was a I I saw an article that s in the global market intelligence had published and raised in an intriguing question are some shale producers under a hoarding gas flaring what's this theory here\nSo this is ... analysis of some ... satellite data that they looked at sort of be clear this is not my own analysis of this data other basically they looked at you know real time satellite data of wearing that no it does\nAnd they found that from twenty ... twenty Seventeen oil companies might in Texas might have flared off twice as much gases they wound up\nReporting to the states which then gave some reports to the feds the federal energy information administration\nBasically what's going on here is that essence he asserts that\nThere is this multi layered reporting system where oil and gas companies report to state regulators who'd been report to the federal energy information administration got it and they say in that chain of reporting you know some of these numbers might be getting lost or skewed too low and they know that this could be happening\nIntentionally or not but that it looks like it's happening\nOkay so let's assume the worst let's assume that there is intentional under reporting just for the sake of argument so we can understand what's at stake here why would oil companies have an interest in under reporting the number of sites where there are flares well there\nAre limits on swearing in Texas I mean the Texas railroad commission regulates the stuff you have to get a permit to where\nThe river commission particularly in the boom times doing a lot of extending those permits and allowing producers to flare which they've been criticized before but they've said that's just what's going on now and it's necessary to keep the oil flowing\nAnd you know there's just this possibility that companies are trying to make sure that they don't have to shut down there well I mean you know wearing got too high the river commission might eventually say OK Our patients is run out you've got to shut down these wells\nAnd their possibly is some of that that's going on currently but you know across the landscape this seeming under reporting\nIf it's intentional would be you know designed to keep the oil flowing basically because that's the valuable commodity it's not this excess of gas\nOr doesn't have a a legal if not criminal implications\n[noise] I mean yeah there are finds you know for violating permits and by leading state regulations on this kind of stuff I mean I I sit the S P analysis to the Texas railroad commission spokesperson got back and said\nUh you know didn't really answer whether or not they're looking into this further but said you know our highest priority is protection of public safety in the environment in that you know Texas oil and gas companies have to be in compliance with the rules but again no sign whether the ... mission is going to look at this analysis in depth anymore in\nParticular is it safe to using to to assume that there's more flaring than reported\nI don't know if it's safe to assume that I mean I I think that part of this as an pie analysis of saying that you know this this multi layered reporting think could be losing some of the numbers so that seems plausible but\nI don't know if it's as high I mean this is they're proprietary analysis that they've done a it's certainly something that environmental groups are concerned about I mean I can tell you just anecdotally that\nThere are things that happened in the oil field that um are accidents you know there are ... that are there ... when you go out there that are supposed to be burning off this gas\nBut are just kind of like your oven at home the pilot light went out sometimes the ... go out and you know it can be awhile before somebody gets down the road and gets out there to relate it so I mean you know accidents happened and and things are um things happen in the oil field that you don't always expect but I don't know\nIf it's to this degree obviously something
