{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Why did you wait so long why did you wait so long to take down this thing that people had so clearly complained about and he said well it which we don't want to punish people who are just wrong we don't want to ban them from Facebook what we're trying to do is figure out how to shape this thing and\nHe acknowledged in effect that because apple had moved on this that he said you know at that point we realized we had to make a decision we had to get we had to get rid of this and so we did it but from my perspective what was interesting about this was that this is the very beginning of an issue for face but this is not the end I mean this is\nJust the front edge of an unbelievably complex problem which is what are the bounds of of free speech what do we actually want to be able to have\nAnd what do we consider to be out of balance what is in effect shouting fire in a crowded theater and what is legitimate provocative unsavory speech and and these are some of the hardest problems that we face and they're now in the hands of let's face it there in the hands of the engineers that people who created this incredibly powerful a application\nYou know there's lots of First Amendment law that says the government can't you know distinguished types of speech and prohibited um is it clear that a private company like Facebook can when it's this\nBig well actually Facebook as a private company can do whatever it wants on speech if if they decided tomorrow that you couldn't talk about golden retrievers on Facebook they could put that ruined place and I think for some reason that\nWe find ourselves really torn you even if you're not a fan of info wars and God Knows I'm not you have to make a person uneasy to know that there is now a company which is capable of deciding not only what kind of information it's going to suppress but also which kind of information it's going to promote\nAnd on any given day there are people who are going to be offended by those choices um but the tools by which Facebook is held accountable or not the tools that we use in politics it's not like you vote the bums out it's not like people are pointed to Facebook's board as if they were Supreme Court justices this is a case in which a private company\nIs making profound choices about the contours and the boundaries of political expression and we don't have obvious tools with which to regulate them\nWhen you look at the arc of the story I mean this company founded by mark ... has this astonishing growth has deeply committed to growth and in doing so [noise]\nYou know compromises privacy and and ends up you know sharing data it shouldn't about its users and gets into some trouble and a question arises about whether the company has the ability um has the capacity for self reflection whether it can take\nYou know adverse information and reexamine the assumptions and practices and in many respects this really comes down to ... ... what did you find about that [noise]\nI found that he is insulated too I think an unhealthy degree from this kind of criticism and\nIf he was sitting with me right now I Would say this directly the reality is he built the company in his own image she's\nHad the luxury of sculpting an organization too is like I mean quite literally the the blue color that Facebook has as a signature blue is chosen because he is red green colorblind and he prefers to look at the color blue can see a very distinctly so in every way both physical and spiritual this company\nReflects his sensibilities but in order to be able to continue to grow and evolve in response to the problems that it encountered\nHe needs people sitting in the room with him who will tell him mark I think you're not seeing this the right way you're not seeing this clearly you're wrong and I was struck that in our interviews I got the sense from him that he knows that on some level he's tried over the years to make these\nChoices to get outside what he described as as as as the bubble\nOr he's got five people who report directly to him and they are all people who he has an effect chosen a and installed in those positions and there's very few there are very few people at Facebook who are willing to stick their neck out and say I fundamentally disagree we need to do things differently [noise]\nYou know at the end of this piece you write that some people think of Mark Zuckerberg as an atomic tongue with little regard for the human dimensions of his work and you say not exactly the truth is something else what's the truth\nThe truth is that he is at peace with what he has done with the choices that he has made I I I came to really\nUnderstand that Mark Zuckerberg in his own conception of his place in history believes that no change happens painless Lee and that change is difficult and in in many ways it's like his inspiration Augusta Caesar he\nHe believes that he's made trade offs that he has in order to grow he had to give up perfection if he wanted to be vastly influential and he couldn't always be quite as safe as people wanted him to be\nAnd in his mind and in the minds of the people around him\nThey are vindicated by their sheer scale and success and for that reason it's very hard for them to accept that the public is howling in many cases for real change because they believe if we had given into the critics at every step along the way and made changes then we wouldn't be as big as we are today\n... thanks so much for speaking with us thanks

Montrose\nBut in the Centre part where it connects in the north west side I think you're going to see a lot of change in that part of the district\nThat's because Hispanic residents now make up about

debate with letting Crenshaw said he seek a seat on the house armed services committee where he could pressure the Army Corps of engineers to complete flood infrastructure projects but that's not the central message of his campaign\nThe campaign has played up I'm a Republican I support the party and I support Donald Trump um that may be enough but it's not enough I think to a kind of inspire um what I call a heavy turnout in the district\nEven with a lower than usual turnout Stein says Republicans probably hold the edge for now\nBut nobody is putting a lot of investment in the future no one thinks this district is going to be here in twenty twenty two\nWhy in between now and twenty twenty two is the next census\nWe're going to get three new congressional seats in Texas and they're going

Brown with the arrival of ball comes some welcome things like cooler weather and Halloween decorations\nBut at the beginning of all it also means flu season is approaching and lots of people are headed to their local clinical pharmacy to get their flu shot after last year's high severity flu season as reported by the Centers for Disease Control\nSome may be wondering just how effective this year's flu shot might actually be Michael deem is John W Cox professor in biochemical in genetic engineering at Rice University he and his team have been looking into the efficacy of flu vaccines professor deem welcome to the Texas standard\nLike David I'm pleased to be with\nUh that that CDC designation of last year's high severity flu season I suppose\nUh it it makes one wonder whether or not last year's flu vaccines curb the severity in other words did did last year's vaccine work\n[noise] sure last year's vaccine was about twenty to twenty five percent effective I Would say so it it had some beneficial effect on curbing the disease and we're all striving to make the vaccine even more effective next year and they were after\nSome effect but uh twenty to twenty five percent put that in perspective of what typically um uh we see with flu vaccines\n[noise] so the ethic of save the vaccine can be between a negligible up to perhaps fifty or sixty percent it's quite difficult to curb the flu entirely from the vaccine if we have a vaccine that perfectly matches the virus than the Africa as he could be fifty to sixty percent\nI see All right so as you look at\nThis year's flu shot and correct me if you're if if I'm wrong but when we talk about people going to the pharmacy or to the clinic to get their flu shot is everyone getting the same flu shot\n[noise] there are several different flu shots so it's possible to get a live attenuated flu shot that is sprayed in the nose\nIt's possible to get a shot that is into your arm there are several types of the shot itself there's three component and a four components and there's also a type of shop it has an adjuvant that may be activate your immune system a bit more as well so there are several choices for people if people are allergic to eggs are are vaccines that are\nNot made an X amount of people don't have this allergy to eggs and our vaccines that are constructed and eggs\nSo when you decide that you're going to go get the flu shot\nOr how do you know which is going to be the most effective and or and or or how effective it's actually going to be\nSure so some of the newer types of production are done outside of eggs are done in cell based ... cell based vaccines we might expect they would be a little bit more effective than the egg based vaccines that's because to manufacture the vaccines an ex requires some modification of the virus\nAnd those modifications generally tend to reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine\nSo I think the cell based vaccines but quite promising as a technology going forward\nBut as you look at a uh the flu shot a more generically described this year what about the African see there is there a way for your team to make a prediction as to the advocacy\nChurch likely to be similar to last year possibly even a little bit lower because there is a new strain that is emerging which we call the Arizona strain and the vaccine is a little bit far from this new Arizona strength so that I Would say actually will be similar and effective is last year perhaps slightly lower\nYou've talked about a kind of nuclear arms race we're currently having between effective vaccines and strengthening flu strains I presume you mean like this Arizona string\n[noise] so the flu is constantly under pressure from the vaccine and from prior infection history in individuals to evolve and this evolution of the viruses what leads to the need for a new vaccines to be developed a every year or every few years against that constantly evolving flu\nHow do you how do you make a choice or or or determination as to which vaccine to get in where in ... I mean the idea of shopping around for a flu vaccine I think is foreign to a lot of folks\n[noise] so there was an interesting possibility for people who in the past could not get the flu shot because maybe they were allergic to eggs\nThere is now there's a new technology of producing the vaccine in cells which it does not involve eggs so it's not possible for people with egg based allergies to still get\nThe flu shot so that's an interesting choice for people I Would say the cell based vaccines might be better than the egg based vaccine overall they're more likely to be more closely representative of the virus itself\nAnd then there's this other possibility of not getting a shot but getting a spray into the nose that's a possibility for people as well\nAnd where do people go to find out the information about like say what what sort of vaccine a clinic or particular clinic or a particular ah a pharmacy might have is is that public knowledge or if the person that's giving you the vaccine are they going to notice information\nIt's always good for people to do a little research beforehand they could check out the CDC website on influenza and flu vaccines and then they can read a bit about the three or four different types of vaccines that are possible and then they can ask their doctor or the clinic what is available at the clinic and what might be suitable for them\nMichael deem is Rice's John W Cox professor and biochemical and genetic engineering he and his team research the embassy of flu vaccines professor thanks so much for spending a few minutes with us understand\nThanks David we're happy to help [noise] and\nThey were going up on thirty nine minutes past the hour Texas standard time\nSeveral I find that it can send the Texas releasing promised ...

consultation with Trump let's get a nominee fast let's get him get and get him here like\n... or her here early in September and use it to as the club for Democrats who are up for re election in red state\nNow just mentioned as we're talking we have the line open to the Senate floor so when the presiding officer opens the microphone to announce the final count and everybody's now recorded at fifty one forty nine we will hear that a Ron Elving is listening along with us\nIt does appear though that the vote unless something dramatically changes in the last second it's fifty one to forty nine it's actually one vote more than they would need ride Ron Elving\nThat's right because if there had been a tie which we do not have that would be broken by vice president Mike Pence who has the constitutional power to break tie let's give a listen ... or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate galleries\n\nThat was just a reminder of from the gallery here let's see if more set on this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one forty nine the gavel comes down Brett Kavanaugh advances to a final vote in the United States Senate there you have a cloture fifty one to forty nine or not the closest to vote in the history of the Supreme Court Nina Totenberg but pretty close to the closest\nI think the closest for some time in the Eighteen hundreds but this is this uh this is a one vote difference a Clarence Thomas was confirmed by it to vote margin and there are senators who\nWho said afterwards that had they known it was that close that they could have made a difference and I think it was ... were in Redmond in Bill Cohen we're prepared to vote against Thomas huh but Bob Dole\nAre said to them I've got the votes and they figured I Need this stuff from do I like a new antagonized\nHim so they are they went ahead now don't may have had more votes in his pocket that he didn't need to fall maybe there were eleven Democrats who voted for Clinton Sam is maybe had another one\nBut in any case he got up into the mid fifties and here we have fifty one it's not the final vote but it's hard to see on the final vote this going much higher than fifty one\nVery hot and we know ah in fact we don't know that he'll get fifty one absolutely because senators can vote differently on the final measure in a moment I'm hoping to go outside of the United states Capitol and hear what the response has been to protesters if this news as I'm sure the news is spreading very rapidly outside the United states Capitol\nAh I'd like to ask Ron Elving about having having studied the history of all this is you have what your senses of this moment [noise]\nOne moment at this one thought at this particular moment is that those ten senators we were just mentioning where Democrats running in states yeah Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen nine of the ten have voted against culture Joe mansion was the lone\nA Democrat to vote for cloture and he is one of those ten even though it is also necessary to say that he seems not to be in as much trouble as some of the others he seems to be on his way to re election but he did not want to be apparently the Democrat who made it a tie vote\nI to be the corresponding a vote that would have forced Mike Pence to break that particular time but in her historic terms of this is quite unusual because until last year if you had\nFifty one or forty nine votes in this case\nAgainst cloture you did not get cloture that's right you seem to be you had to have sixty votes and and when we talk about Mitch McConnell and his ... significant maneuverings over the years none is more important than his decision to change the filibuster rules so that it would apply\nThat that the filibuster would not apply or not be usable when we came to Supreme Court nominees you change that last year for Neil Gorsuch and now of course it's still in place\nI Want to take notice something that you just said there Ron Elving because you said that there are ten Democrats who are seen as vulnerable who are in states that voted for Donald Trump who might see some advantage in voting for the Supreme Court nominee and nine of them chose to vote no and the one who did choose to vote yes seemed to have an option you could have voted no but he decided that he wanted to vote\nYes we presume that so many of these lawmakers so much of the time or making shameless short term political calculations are the evidence is overwhelming but that is very often drew and yet it is not necessarily always true and we heard just yesterday Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nWho is extremely vulnerable uh who seems possibly on her way to defeat who chose to vote no announced or no vote and the immediate political analysis was well there goes her Senate reelection\nBut China and she said what she said was this isn't a political vote I just couldn't face myself when I got up in the morning if I voted that way they just you I've known to many other women like this and\nAnd she is behind in North Dakota by a smile out as much as you mentioned is ahead in West Virginia so these are different calculations look at somebody like Claire McCaskill in Missouri whose races absolutely neck and neck\nShe also chose to vote no and a number of these Democrats did vote for Neil Gorsuch he got three democratic votes isn't that right and you know I think that's I think he got three democratic votes and um and it was a assumed that those people would be under tremendous pressure to vote yes again on another Trump nominee\nEven if he were conservative as Brett Kavanaugh his until we got to the allegations of sexual assault and that raised a whole new set of questions\nAnd and so did the cabin up performance at the hearing it wasn't just Christine Blasey Ford who was I think\nBy what the Republican but Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they believed her they just didn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president of the United states admitted that she was a credible witness yeah Philly decided by some\nRed Kavanaugh's performance which she\nSort of kinda apologize for in the wall Street Journal editorial that performance was unlike anything anybody had ever seen by a nominee I think that's one thing that a Chuck Schumer said that is absolutely on debatable um there were things that both\nSchumer and McConnell set\nIn their closing arguments that I thought were poignantly true for the country for the Senate for the shambles that this was I don't think this was a one way street by any means nobody comes away from this either side with completely clean hands but\nIt it devolved a ...\nAt the end into the worst spectacle imaginable for the Supreme Court of the United states uh and its standing which is really only a almost an emotional standing that it has that people follow what it says because they believe in it and for the Senate if the United\nWell let's review some of the remarks that were made in those speeches before the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination Chuck Schumer of New York described Kavanaugh says testimony as the bitter barista\nPartisan testimony in memory he said that this was a nominee or had hard right conservative George jurisprudence and then the dam broke there were questions about him according to Schumer and the dam broke with credible allegations of sexual assault decades ago while he was in high school\nA completely opposite picture painted by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying that he\nHadn't sinister meetings had been found in unison statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered great and dignity that there was no corroborated\nEvidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this was one of the most consequential votes you've ever had and it's a vote\nThat went for Kavanaugh this is special coverage from NPR News\nSupport comes from

Jews the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat\nWho voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nUm and the Democratic base Republicans are pointing to a an uptick in enthusiasm amongst their base over the past week so who's able to harness this heading into them in terms\nWill be the big question there was a recent round of polling just in the past twenty four hours or so were they asked people are you more or less likely in these battleground states yeah are you are less likely to vote for somebody\nAh for the incumbent if they voted no on Kavanaugh\nAnd what was most interesting to me is that uh in almost every one of those cases the I'm no difference actually one out and in some cases very decisively that the Kavanaugh though would actually have no difference in how voters were planning a ... it would have no impact on their vote\nWhich sort of makes sense doesn't it because normally you get to a mid term people are not that engaged maybe they haven't been paying attention to politics but surely maybe not the whole country but a very large percentage percentage of the country has been been paying far closer attention to our politics for the last couple of years then would normally be the case\nI I think that's right and one last point I'd make on this though is that in mid term elections traditionally one\nOf the biggest motivators has been anger [noise] uh and so which side is going to be angry or come election day over this will be interesting and I think part of that couldn't be how how tomorrow turns out if\nKavanaugh wins narrowly there will be a tremendous amount of negative energy on the left that could help Democrats\nAre on mid term election day if he's defeated ... there's an argument to me made that it could swing the other the other way but there is no question right now that this issue has harnessed a lot of anger on both sides\nWill stay with us for a moment because I Want to bring in NPR's Dominican minds NARAL into this political discussion and here's something that's on my mind medical we know from an NPR survey and other surveys that Republicans who were not as enthused\nI've become a lot more enthused at least according to the NPR survey how are Democrats viewing this oh no we just blew it or just one more thing to deal with\nDemocrats have been fired up for the entire year and I think what was significant about the survey is that you saw all Republicans and their level of enthusiasm and whether or not they see the congressional elections this year as very important\nSpike and really all you know all of a scientist I talked to a you know attribute that to the cabinet confirmations and especially among Republican men I think that the issue here is going to be whether or not that's a temporary spike\nAnd you know his cabinet gets through ... does that dissipate does do people move on from that and do they see that there's these elections with less urgency or do they hold on to that\nIt's probably something in between which is usually what happens and also after Labor Day you tend to see a lot more of these groups that seem sideline become more energized and Republican groups generally are the types of groups that become more energized I'm are more likely to vote in these elections\nMolly thing is it fair to observe normally we would say we're just a month away from the election but given the speed of the news cycle and the amount of news and maybe there were three or four years away from the election at this point\nYeah that's right there's like Seventeen lifetimes between now and election day [noise]\nUh and if there's one thing twenty sixteen uh taught us is that\nWhat seems a certainty at any given moment a isn't a ... a certain tea and so there's plenty of time for both sides to make their case on this uh and who who knows what else is going to come up there I Would not be surprised there's an entirely new issue that's not on anyone's radar screen that becomes more determinative come election day\nMore lazy democratic strategist he's at Georgetown thanks so much really appreciate it thank you one of the voices we've heard as the vote was prepared for and then cast today fifty one forty nine votes to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the final vote which we'd expect tomorrow one of the voices we heard\nWas Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who delivered a speech on the Senate floor of this morning\nA bipartisan majority of senators\nConsidering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh is testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully heartbreaking testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford and vote to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the president just in the Senate\nAnother name for the sake of the center of the Supreme\nCourt ended up America I Hope I pray\nMy colleagues will do so\nHis colleagues did not that's Chuck Schumer speaking just before a vote that came down to fifty one forty nine in favor of Brett Kavanaugh\nMoving to that final round that final vote which is expected tomorrow let's bring on someone who doubt must feel differently about that vote than Senator Schumer did Gail Trotter is a spokeswoman for the Judicial Crisis network a conservative group\nThat has campaigned against abortion and on other issues can morning\nGet mining so you are just the way you said good morning you sound happy yeah\nA long process and I just want to take this opportunity to thank senator Collins Senator Flake and than senator Manchin to vote to move this a con for very long and excruciating confirmation process to a final vote\nNow with that said let me ask you about the point that Charles Schumer just raised he essentially argued that whatever you think of Brett Kavanaugh we have damaged the institution of the Senate we've damaged the institution of the Supreme Court by moving forward with someone who does not\nEnjoy a broad consensus of opinion even though you agree with judge Kavanaugh even though you favor judge Kavanaugh is there some damage to moving somebody without a consensus like this there's\nBeen a lot of damage to the Supreme Court through this process and through the reputation of the Senate or that we saw that before any of these allegations were ever raised we thought in the\nTwo hundred people who are arrested during the hearings the original thirty one hours that judge Kavanaugh testified we thought through the constant interruptions by senator Kamala Harris and senator Booker we thought through the questioning a judge Kavanaugh and the delay\nTactics used by the Senate Democrats so I Would agree with Senator Schumer that there hasn't been a lot of\nCollateral damage through this process but I think that that was part of the intention that\nSenator Schumer said before President Trump even a ... released the name that judge Kavanaugh as his Supreme Court nominee and Senator Schumer said that they were going to oppose President Trump's eventual nominee by any means necessary\nCourse we knew that the nominee would be from a list that was approved by a conservative activist group would be a nominee nominated by president who said he expected his nominees to automatically overturn roe versus Wade in the thirty or so seconds we have before this break I just like to know Kevin out and say I'm going to overturn roe versus Wade\nBut do you anticipate that he would have an opportunity to do that or something close to it\nNever been about one issue and I but let's ask about that one issue here\nNo one can say that about an issue that was used against Sandra Day O'Connor who upheld rosy way that was used against senator Anthony Kennedy who judge Kavanaugh is going to replace and be another great justice and at the at a scare tactic used against\nJustices you don't put politics first but instead are faithful to the constitution the independent it didn't work with judge Justice O'Connor it didn't work with Justice Kennedy it shouldn't work with ...\n... what we think will be justice Kevin I'm\nBill ... thanks for taking the time I really appreciate it yeah it's great to be with\nYou she's with the Judicial Crisis network this is special coverage from NPR News\n\nThe\nSupport comes from Austin community college
