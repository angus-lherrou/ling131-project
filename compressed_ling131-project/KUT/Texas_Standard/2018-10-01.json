United States Congress has to ratify it and congressional leaders have said that they're not planning on ratifying are considering it until next year\nSomething that a lot of folks have a have been a concerned about is a steel tariffs is there any mention of what might happen now or any sense of what might happen now with those steel tariffs\nOr Canada in particular was hoping that now that we have an agreement this would mean that will be able to the United states would reduce those tariffs towards Canada and Mexico but uh that's still up in the air\nPresident Trump is obviously claiming this as a major victory how do you see it in terms of a of a win for Mexico and Canada for this to be an agreement that's going to have any your ability of course they've got to see this as a something good for themselves to\n[noise] well that's exactly right I think Mexico actually was able to increase the amount of products and pray and products that they were producing which made them more comfortable with increasing that\nDomestic concert requirement we talked about and I also think Canada realizes that were your number one trading partner and so having this agreement was absolute critical I think for the Canadian economy\nRaymond Robertson is professor and chair in economics and government in the department of international affairs at Bush school of government in public

thanks for um [noise]\n\nGoing to the calendar it's been a little over two years since Texas' campus concealed carry law went into effect in by the looks of things now it's likely to stay\nIn August a federal appeals court threw out a lawsuit by three professors from the University of Texas at Austin who argued that the law stifles free speech but how does the law had any measurable effect on the state's college campuses uh Houston Public media's Florian Martin wanted to find out\nFirst I was wondering if there's any way of knowing how many students are bringing guns to campus so I checked right here at home with the University of Houston police department there'd be no way for us to know that because we don't ask the question Brett Collier is the acting captain for you HPD's patrol division they do have one indicator\nHow many people leave their firearms with the campus police because they're planning to be in what's called the exclusion zone\nUniversities to designate certain zones on campus where guns are not allowed\nAt UH that includes science labs storms the daycare facility and sporting facilities\nAmong others [laughter] sorry exchange\nCollyer shows me where students can surrender their ...\nThat will bring out a a safe you know small safe or\nSo they get to put their thumb print in put the\nDevice in the box and then we'll take it to the back and start\nHave been thirty one request to store a firearm at UH pd\nBut that still doesn't tell us how many students over all our arms so I called up the student to advocate for the right to take guns onto college campuses Quinn Cox's with students for concealed carry in studies accounting at the University of Texas at Austin He wouldn't say whether or not he is carrying\nThat's the beauty of concealed carry um is that you know no matter where you know it's it's concealed or no one's no one's going to know\nBut it's group came up with an estimate for how many Texas students carry on campus the group you stayed up from concealed carry licenses for which you have to be Twenty one or older to qualify\nFrom basically Twenty one twenty three the uh licensure rates in the Kerry rates there you know as compared to how often other people carry and we've determined then it's a little bit above ... percent of the student population that his license to carry now whether they carry or not we have no way of knowing that\nNo way of knowing because there's so little research that was a ... eleven study by for researchers that Sam Houston State University an estimated that at least Eighteen percent of classrooms would have at least one arm student\nMichael Kavanaugh as one of the researchers now teaches criminal justice CJ for short at the University of Houston downtown he says the results very significantly by building\nOne of the interesting findings was that the CGI building and Sam Houston had the highest number of people that would carry right it just made logical sense the art building had the lowest number of people that would carry\nKavanaugh suspects the overall numbers to be higher now that the laws actually in effect either way has there been any kind of effect and safety negative or positive Kavanaugh says there have been very few incidents state wide\nRight when the law was implemented they had a couple of incidents I think there was one at ... state of a gun going off and then as for the last two years I mean there's it's really been pretty silent\nThere have been a few more minor incidents\nIn the past year a gun went off accidentally in a dorm room at Texas a and M. and at UT Austin pistols were found in women's restrooms but the lack of violent incidents doesn't tell the whole story says Hanna Shearer an attorney with the Giffords Law Center to prevent gun violence\nI think it's the impact of students not applying and professor is not taking positions at Texas universities because they don't want to be in a situation where they have to allow guns on the high\nShearer says guns on campus might only increase the risk of suicide and she worries what confusion could result if there weren't active shooter on campus but two years after it took effect there was a little hard data to assess the impact of Texas's campus\nCarry law in Houston I'm Florian Martin for the Texas standard\n[noise]\nWells Dunbar ... off of the Texas Tribune festival which we'll have more about a little later in the broadcast she's monitoring social media on this Monday though\nI did it again new details about the shelters for child immigrants in tornado shared

estimated at about sixteen hundred young detainees but it's other details that got the boat that got people talking\nThere transport there announced in them only a few hours beforehand and happening undercover in the middle of the night\nThe times also notes that unlike permanent shelters which are license then monitored by child welfare authorities the tent city\nAt tornado isn't and isn't
