Panhandle continue to\nEvaluate its impact images show some communities utterly leveled the death count at last check stood at twelve\nBut that's expected to rise after other recent storms like Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico and Harvey here in Texas we're seeing that the official casualty count stone always add up\nIndeed a storm death in one state might not be counted as such in another so right Sheri Fink a correspondent for the New York times why does it matter these differences in what qualifies as a storm related that\nIt matters signed an individual level because survivors in at federally declared disaster can be entitled in some cases to funeral assistance so it can have an impact\nOn you know that person's loved ones all the way to how officials prepare for disasters how public health officials try to keep people safe\nAfter disasters that's the important than keeping track of these things and understanding why it is that people die so that hopefully can intervene and and prevent those\nSend future disasters\nBut I suppose there's also it has to be admitted a political dimension here too as we've seen in the aftermath\nOf Puerto Rico well\nAbsolutely uh it it has this number of the death count has become extremely political because the long held death toll was sixty four and\nThen public health research you know looking at statistics showed that close to three thousand more people die than would have been expected otherwise so there was a real you know a big big big Gulf between official numbers and what we think actually happened\nSo let me understand why it is that there isn't a consensus on how you count deaths in the wake of a storm a surely there would be federal guidelines I mean the Centers for Disease Control\nCorrect there are some federal guidelines they were put out last year after Hurricane Maria based on um\nYou know a convening of lots of experts to look at this issue but this is a long held problem it goes back many years and researchers have been writing about it for many years so this new guide that the CDC put out is an attempt to\nGet right to the very person who fills out the death certificate and help them understand\nFor purposes of keeping track of the things let's have everybody do this in a standard way\nAnd here's the big issue I think we can all understand what a direct storm death is red is what we're seeing today with people who were killed when the wind blew two and a tree fell on them or\nYou know very tragically all the people who are going out and driving into floodwaters and drowning that way the tricky part is what they're calling so called a indirect deaths so this could be somebody who they rely on oxygen and they couldn't get their oxygen or\nA you know they were having a heart attack but an ambulance couldn't get to them and so what\nThe CDC has recommended is that those be counted as storm deaths too but currently those are typically missed [noise]\nSo um you you spoke with a Harris County medical examiner's office in Houston and of course they received a lot of attention certainly in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey did they explain what their policy or rationale was toward toward the use of the CDC guidelines\nThey did I went back to the Harris County\nMedical examiner's office and said now that the CDC guy does out are you going to change how you look at these\nIndirect deaths they said no we need to keep doing things the way we've been doing them if you listen this definition\nWhere's the line and so we'll just make sure that all that information on you know from our investigations are are in somebody's records and um unfortunately though if if it's not recorded on somebody's\nDeath certificate if the storm itself or the natural disaster or human disaster in the case of terrorist attack and that's not mentioned on a death certificate it becomes harder for officials\nTrying to go through statistics to really detect the relationship and so at all does have to start with the individual coroner medical examiner or doctor and\nI found that just everybody I spoke to for this article had a different way of thinking about it\nTallying the dead wires storm death and once they might not count in another it's a very thought provoking article by Sheri Fink who is a correspondent for the New York times will link to it at
