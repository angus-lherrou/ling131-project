Curtis a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of the new biography of Louis read in the last years of his life that's fairly big chapter\nOf the end of his life liberty became involved in a Tibetan Buddhism meditation a form of tai chi 'em to coincide with him giving up a drugs and alcohol\n[noise] well you know there was those were elements of these kind of the spiritual quest um lose part was something that really went back to the velvet underground um you know Lou told you know one person I interviewed that song by like White Heat which to the naked eye is about speed\nAh he told this person that the white like part was about a certain type of vision or\nA you know he always was trying different diets and you have different forms of a different types of disciplines to get him\nYou know kind of out of himself and maybe in connection to ... you to connect with something um higher mhm\nYeah what a redemption maybe was was one of the things he saw it so that was the latest manifestation of it and I think it took on you know once you give up drugs um [noise] you know I mean not to even heroin or something like heroin expresses that kind of spiritual yearning for transcendence but you know once you did give up drugs\nUm I think those you know to the tai chi and Buddhism and all that stuff that came meditation became much more significant for him because he needed it more mhm\n[noise] you know for all of us who love the work of artists who aren't necessarily like the nicest people in the world there's always always always some reconciliation you have to do with the beach in your feelings about\nHuh has a person has behaved in the real world and the importance of their art and the value of their art show is that something you've had to come to some kind of reconciliation of with with Lou Reed as as a person in as an artist\nI'm of course you know I think that um you know I think this is something that you know I think this is an issue very much in the culture right now\nYou know talking about a sexual harassment of women\nYeah generally like I said oh so you know you're reading about some director who's you know doing just completely abominable thing cities you know young girls who were just trying to re actresses they just think it All right so like so is it okay to go like the movie you know and\nI think that kind of thing comes up more and more now you know there's a you know you know Lou Reid's um [noise] you know of physical abuse of women you know that's not [noise]\nUm you know anything that you want to hear about or or you know but does that poison everything that he does [laughter]\nYou know I I sort of struggle with this you know in my own life you know being raised Catholic group there's this idea of um the near occasionally sin that not only are you supposed to avoid doing bad things but you're supposed to avoid situations in which\nYou might do them and um you know you'd I Do feel you know in and engaging certain characters and certain types of behavior you know I don't know what I Would have done if my life is that way if I was a drug addict or I was out of control or I\nDid those things again that's not to use them but it does it it did it short circuits my ability to feel morally superior to it\nUm I just I found that the best strategy was simply to just described it as honestly as I could and then you know people could ah go where they want to go with that\nMhm [noise] well I think she was in all the music is there something you'd like to enlist [noise] wow\n[laughter] are so many you know I mean let's say you know it's a pretty intense interviewed let's end with rock and roll you know I mean I I feel like that is loose statement about the ability of this music to\nUm to kind of help you transcend the circumstances that year and and and show you a larger world and save your life and uh you know in certain ways I feel my own life was saved by rock and roll and lose certainly felt about himself so I think that song like do\nYou credit is a pleasure to talk with you thank you so much\nYou know my dad being pleasure was entirely mine thank you\n[laughter]

about moms pressing question for homecoming season as the lights liquor on football fields again tonight but that standard gets started right after the [noise]\nMay have burgers and um you've been awfully kind to take some ah to take some time to talk with us I I have to ask you a a with a more troops coming in if in fact that happens\nYou know how do you think your population is going to react to that is I mean you say that there's not a sense of invasion from the south what about uh having a having a active duty forces coming in from the north\n[noise] well you know uh [noise] you know I I don't think it's necessary [noise]\nLike I said we have seen we've seen these these troops here already um I mean I I I Wish we would spend our money there there's a lot of other ways I think we can be spending our\nOur taxpayers' dollars an hour out of you know I think this was all just kind of political theater if they blend in trying to like they've done previously again it's you know ... there's not much to say about it but if they come in and and we used to be more\nAggressive role them then I'd have a I have a real problem with that and I'm hoping it doesn't come to that but that's you know that's kind of where we are right now\nJohn Ferguson is the mayor of the border temper city of Texas in far west Texas mayor Ferguson thank you for spending a few minutes out of your day to talk with some standard\nThank you so much and you guys have a great day\nNow let's get a take from someone who's on the front lines his job is to patrol that border Chris Cabrera is vice president with the national border patrol council he represents border patrol employees and the Rio Grande valley welcome back to the Texas standard\nYeah thank you for having me what do you think of these plans to send active duty military troops to the southern border\nI think if they let these troops when they come down and let them\nWork let them get out there and and be a force multiplier I think it'll be a very successful oh fortunately what we've seen recently with the last deployment is they had let these guys are work the way they had in the past there they're not letting them out to the field\nThey're not letting them ports multiply they're they're keeping them in the back so they're they're really not able to get out and and do what we need them to do\nNow let me ask you that the president has characterized this caravan as an invasion do you see it that way\nYou know I I I don't know if the ... the right word I I can understand where he's coming from now you know I ... you know and I guess in the states it is an invasion um let me think about it you having you know two for five ten thousand votes is your story to cross and and you know they haven't come across yeah here but we did see the film across the\nBridge in southern Mexico and they're just taking what they want and what that is is hey we want to come in and were coming in now whether you like it or not um that's not what the rule of law said you just can't come on it and do what you want I mean these these guys need people anybody that comes into our country especially if they're going to be here for that\nIn medical screening any that their health screening how are you going to support yourself there there's many different factors that come in with immigrating to our country you just can't just come in and take it that's just not the way things are done here\nWell speaking of the way things are done here I think that something that the mayor or city I was concerned about was you know that we're sort of tactics enforce these troops would be authorized to use I mean and just how militarized these troops would be I mean I hear you talking about you know getting medical attention for those crossing the border um illegally\nAre you concerned about the militarization of of the border if you have troops staring down a would be migrants with a with guns\nYou know I can understand that um I I Know when we first started we started getting a National Guard troops and they you know there was that question well you know what's gonna happen you guys are used to do anything to a different way and I was in the military so\nI understand why people see it that way as you know what are they going to do you know when when they come across something but at the end of the day the these these young men and women in the in the service they're they're highly trained 'em they're they're they're good folks there\nYou know a ... and and I haven't seen anything to to make me believe that that something would go a ride with having troops down there\n... are you concerned about the politicization of the border here I mean is this more politics than than practical help\nYeah it it's all politics it's one hundred percent politics and that's the problem with it um for instance I'll give you a quick for instance a couple\nOf months back we had people coming down to our areas and telling us that the um the the whole facility processing centers where we're not seek camps and and child penitentiaries and it was a shame that we should be ashamed of ourselves\nA and it was a I think it was a congressman from California being a congressman was in two thousand eight um the facility went up a two thousand fourteen she didn't have a problem in two thousand fourteen hundred Democratic president but now Republican president\nIt's a Nazi kept 'em and nothing will get picked nothing will ever get ... immigration system as long as people keep thinking Democrat Republican and I don't\nMean to say it's one party or the other it's both are both parties are at fault for this both parties in Congress are at fault and they need to take off their their their their partisan cap what it aside and get into a big problem if they can't do that then they need to step aside and let somebody\nAh in who will do that because at the end of the day what we're looking at regardless of what side of this immigration debate you stand out whether it's not a man keep 'em out yes no whatever\nA lot of young innocent children are being harmed by this they're falling victim to child predators along the way to the heat related injuries ... it's insane and if if people care about these young when trying to come across are being sent by their parents to come across\nThat we need to fix this problem because if not we're going to see more harm young ones along the way\nAre you in Chris ... is vice president with the national border patrol council which represents border
