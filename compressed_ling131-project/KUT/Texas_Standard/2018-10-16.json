covers immigration and border is Nick welcome detectors standard\nThanks good to be with you what is the Trump Administration considering here and what\nI think they're looking at a whole range of options but with a one being discussed um then we wrote about is what they called binary choice\nAnd that would involve um keeping families in detention uh up until the twenty they limit that is allowed by the courts but that's the amount of time that children can be held in an immigration jail I'm setting and then at that point\nPresenting the parents with the option of either waving the child's right to be released\nAnd remaining as a family in detention until the until they're um immigration claims are fully process\nOr allowing their child to be released into the custody of health and Human Services into one of these shelters that we've all read about\nAnd that would involve obviously the separation of the family\nSo why did they think that this policy is going to be more palatable are acceptable given I mean we we we all ... recall the outrage of\nUh of last June well they're looking at um a some recent court decisions I'm\nParticularly surrounding the litigation that followed I'm a family separation measures this spring including a decision by a federal judge in in San Diego I'm\nWho essentially said that the government did have the right to present parents with that choice um and you know the the thinking here for the government is that\nThey want to keep the adults in particular in detention and they want you know they they believe that um too many migrants are essentially using children as a way to come into the United states and avoid being held in custody and once they're\nA forced to release them from custody um you know they they say that it's almost impossible to get them back and it's a way for people to remain in the country illegally so there is such a using children as a kind of their ... their own children in this case as a ticket to to get into the country and I'm kind of go underground\nSo if there were an option for families to stay together where would these families actually go I mean we're talking about detention centers are more these ... like structures like in tornado Texas well\nThat's a big question I mean I'm you know they do not have the potential to ask the whole\nThe quantity of families that are arriving each month in August the last month for you know which we have statistics for that was nearly Thirteen thousand family members\nSo keep in mind right now the government's current capacity for what they call family residential centers these are like these are like detention centers that are that are essentially approved for children they only have the capacity combined capacity of about three thousand dead so three thousand beds and you're getting\nYou're getting at least a twelve Thirteen thousand new people coming every month so where are they going to put them that's that's a big on\nOn one of the things you know we know that that that\nIs it the homeland security department has asked the Pentagon to um you know to for permission and and for for help um creating temporary detention camps um you know and so we could see like a family a version of a ... toward Nino as a as you guys know which is like you know essentially a a\nA camp in a desert like you know setting where folks are sleeping in you know intense and things like that\nWere at a time but I have to ask timeline as anyone saying when this could happen\nThere they aren't um but obviously the White House is eager to act and and the numbers keep going up and right now we start you know there's just this morning we see the president tweeting about a a new caravan of families coming up through Central America

role for beef getting to a model for their camp and how to stop the bleeding cycle\nDriver of of the growth of the wind industry and the U.S has been the production tax credit which was established under the\nBush administration um it's been in place since Nineteen Ninety four but about Seventy percent of the thirty seven billion dollars in an subsidies that have been that the industry has received come from this one credit which expires at the end of next year\nAnd a what I've been looking into is the role that the states will play\nAnd the future of of this industry\nWell before we get to what role in Texas might have here I'm just hung up on this number of what was it how ... how much in some cities again\nThirty seven billion dollars and thirty\nSeven billion dollars I can see how that could go a long way toward helping to establish an industry here in Texas but isn't the idea of subsidies that you set something up and then it starts to pay for itself I mean these weren't\nGoing to be a infinite were they I mean there there was going to be some kind of limit right\nJust in the last decade the\nProduction tax credit the subsidy has expired four times but through lobbying effort and\nThe past administration's focus on green energy and renewable energy it's it's been extended several times so\nUnder the current political climate industry leaders do not expect this to be extended again so that is what has set off this rush to build a new wind farms across the U.S\nTwo thousand two hundred of these\nThree hundred five hundred foot wind turbines were built just in two thousand Seventeen in Texas\nBut right now there's been a lot from other states pushed to reading news these mandates I'm so that they could continue to subsidize and incentivize the production and investment of wind energy\nIs it ... if you have these mandates I mean that's sort of sounds like the stick in the carrot and stick equation whereas this Texas offers subsidies or are they not just saying\nYour energy mix in total has to include a certain amount of renewables [noise]\nSo then Texas the mandates were met in two thousand and ten and I'm right now Texas is producing about Thirteen percent of its energy from renewables but compared to the federal\nSubsidies it is it is very small in comparison it's twenty four dollars per megawatt hour where the federal subsidy compared to about fifty five cents that comes from the state so the main factor in the growth of wind energy in Texas is the free market\nBut also the seven billion dollar investment that\nWas made in the early to thousands to connect all of these wind farms that were built and in West Texas out in the middle of nowhere on top of these may says so there has to be a way to connect them to the grid and I'm taxes\nAll taxpayers they paid seven billion dollars to next to them um with this recent when rush\nOr the capacity of these transmission lives that were built um first starting in two thousand and seven um is is almost that capacity so there might need to be further investment from Texas if this when rush continues\nWell now the question then I mean what does all this add up to for the future of the Texas wind industry if indeed the subsidies federal subsidies are allowed to expire\nSo these federal subsidies last for ten years so as long as they get in before the deadline is December twenty Nineteen [noise]\nThey will have a this credit for the next ten years so the wind farms that are being built right now and that have been built in the last uh you know Fifteen Twenty years will continue to produce this energy\nBut something interesting has also happened because of the subsidies that investment um new technology has been created where these wind turbines compared to the ones that were built Fifteen Twenty years ago mark twice as tall and are able to produce three times as much energy so there definitely is a future for the industry\nNow whether there'll be able to survive without the subsidy that's that's the question\nChristian Hernandez knows about this subject as a Texan Andy twenty Seventeen American University fellow at the center for Public
