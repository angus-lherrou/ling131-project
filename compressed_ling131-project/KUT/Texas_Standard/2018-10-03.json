Americans space adventure exploring the frontiers beyond the clouds but in fact the idea was launched you might say as president Dwight Eisenhower mold over options for keeping hostilities with the Soviets from becoming a third world war\nII era Berger senior space editor at Ars Technica writes this anniversary serves as a reminder that we can think then vice president Richard Nixon for NASA how so they're at burger joins us now thanks so much for joining us on the standard\nWas my pleasure thanks for having me on what\nRole did a Nixon play in shaping the mission the space program\nWell after ah the the Soviet Union launched neck in Nineteen fifty seven the u._s. was trying to figure out how to respond and the real question was whether it should be led by the military are led by some civilian space agency I'm that good and yet exist\nAnd so it came down to President Eisenhower calling a meeting in February Nineteen fifty eight and the vice president was there and the president was leaning toward a military action that was his background\nUm the military the army and navy had missile programs already underway and\nWas actually Nixon and the president's done as science advisor a guy named James ... who said wait wait wait no\nLet's think about this for let's say we're trying to win the hearts and minds of Americans have people around the world it would be a nice contrast 'em for the United states to have a program kind of out in the open you know non military peaceful purposes using space and so you would have the Soviet clandestine\nMilitary program in the United states we're kind of what became NASA\n[laughter] it's it's fascinating to imagine Nixon making that argument especially when you consider his reputation over the years certainly a during and after his presidency he was seen as someone who is anything but transparent but here he is in Nineteen fifty eight making the case\nFor NASA that a while retaining its military options I suppose in his applications nonetheless is a ... is trying to present itself as being opened in for the good of of all mankind\n[noise] yeah I think you know for all of his personal flaws and Nixon certainly had many and and as president became couldn't ignore my niece and I think you know his his political instincts are are pretty good and and here he saw\nNo opportunity because if you think about you put yourself in United States ... back in the Nineteen fifties and sixties the country was behind the Russians in space you know they were doing all of the interesting thing and so this was a way to differentiate the United states and and sort of put it back\nOn a certain level above the Soviet Union at least in terms of morals\nWell do you say in your piece for our technical that uh this argument about having NASA as a as a kind of a fixture to benefit everyone is coming\nBack into focus now how so\n[noise] well you know there are some real questions about where Nassar goes this century because the military\nWas not particularly happy and I think it is and it hasn't been since that that the civil agency came in and took over human space flight I'm so they're they're kind of encroaching on NASA and you've got commercial activities like space sex and and they're doing interesting things there are encroaching on NASA and so there's\nThere's a real question of what the space agency should do in the coming decades but you\nKnow the fact of the matter is that no one else really land probes on ... ... spacecraft the outer solar system no one has flown by Pluto all these kinds of interesting things and so you know NASA still has a a future in an expiration\nUm it's just it's it's got some issues both from the military interest and then on the commercial side well\nI I'll say I mean you think about President Trump's proposal for a space for ... for example how does that square with NASA and its say next sixty years\nThat's a great question I think that's something that you know how to be you know work through 'em in coming years NASA you know technically has nothing to do with the states where it's just it's an air force reorganization that sort of thing but out of that you could see air force astronaut at some point\nUm and kind of an erosion of Nassar's primacy of the center for putting Americans into space\nBut presumably NASA would retain it's ah it's mantle as the civilian space program doing science and research in the open while the space for ... takes on a military mission\nYeah that that would be the idea certainly\nThere are burger is senior

them upon themselves\nBut they are all Medicaid a kid and as a as a provider at as on networks within medicate yet you're here in my own take on it politician like dirty diaper shitty changed periodically and or the same reason I feel that a politician\nAnd we have allergies I guess area but what I like about or is that he\nKnew a lot and he bite or like Medicaid expansion to help like can't speak up for themselves on a a state and national level\nAnd I think that's what they have a really interesting is uh he's taking that apply for those folks like my kids are what are like well that and he ... they can't take that for themselves so I think that is what he fighting that can't sneak up on eighty that that it can be done with it all that ate at a cave\nWill Dana let me take back there and thank you so much for your call I Want to get one more caller here before we run out of time Kobe is calling from Austin, Texas you're on the Kobe\nI think like oh You're welcome what's your thought on it\nUh you know I just think that uh this election just like the presidential election we just that it's going to surprise a lot of people I'm I'm a lifelong Texan and as a struck down the middle just like your last caller\nUm I think this will be a referendum on the Trump Administration and the fact that Cruz has not been a good senator first date he didn't do what he went to Washington to do and he's a week ship in the harbor and I think ... come on there's a strong candidate would win a lot of election law to see\nIf we can I ask you a quick question we're running on time I really want to question we need to be fair to Senator Cruz when you say you don't think he's been a good senator for Texas I mean what exactly do you mean because every new candidates says they're going to change Washington\nFrom Washington is a giant beast and everyone who goes there find that much more difficult to do than he or she anticipated what is it that the senator has not done\nYou know I think after the last presidential election is just sort of rallied a little too close to Trump lap\nAnd has stood up for what I Would consider more traditional values like John McCain did and the conservative party that's long since dying away so\nI I just think there are a lot of people who have values in Texas but don't matches and and and he really hasn't brought more jobs to the state that were coming here already he hasn't done anything for our economy that wasn't happening already like you say Washington's a big place Texas is a big state he's been surfing wave and it didn't do much right energy\nTo it will Kobe thank you so much for your call a brand and running has who just got a minute to go here what do you share in in ... analysis of what he wants from a a Texas senator\nWell I think that they were looking for change him in Texas has been a one party state for so long that it's\nThe case that many people have just checked out why our voter participation

kind of\nDe legitimizing the treaty and if we take concrete actions to pull out of the treaty that the major cornerstone of arms control that will be shaky or or perhaps even falling\nOr they're clear

nine of them and coming up a unified position I don't necessarily think it's going away I don't think it's as big a deal as many people are making it out to be [noise]\nWe've been speaking with professor Michael ... author who specializes in international relations at the University of Texas at Austin professor ... thanks for joining us on the standard that gave\nWhen he was master of the Senate LBJ use something called the Johnson treatment and now the Austin American statesman reports the senior senator from Texas is testing out the corn and treatment as he takes the lead role\nPushing the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh three Republican senators remain holdouts Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nBut the stakes in this fight go beyond a confirmation vote Philip bump is national correspondent for the Washington Post welcome thanks or a fight over Kavanaugh's one thing it's another where control of the Senate stands in the midterms but you write the two shouldn't be seen in isolation one is affecting the other house so\nWell to be honest we don't know the extent to which one is affecting the other but it's very clear that that the Kavanaugh nomination has very quickly become the most polarizing issue President Trump's presidency which is a pretty remarkable thing to say given how polarized philosophy bike rides that he's done\nBut to count on um a nation has the biggest splits two Democrats or Republicans that we've seen so far and the reason why obviously is that this has become a very very partisan fight become partisan fight since become partisan fight nationally\nAnd that as an ad natural eco with in the mid term elections are a lot of Democrats who I see the Supreme Court now is a much bigger issue than they did in twenty sixteen the Supreme Court according to a few Research Center is now the key issue for the twenty team elections people are paying a lot of attention to what happens with this white people are very strong opinions about what happens with this fight\nThat necessarily although it's hard to evaluate how much at this point not necessarily trickles into metrics\nAll right well let's take a look at the state of the Senate as we speak Republicans holder or lead in a fifty a races or if a proceed so democratic caucus holder leads in forty nine seats according to your reporting here\nSo when I'm not clear on is whether or not the Kavanaugh nomination and the battle over that changes in other words shifts a opinion or whether or not it just ... or ... opinion because as we've seen a lot of Trump supporters are are backing Kavanaugh one hundred percent and we see the same thing on the Democratic side\n[noise] that's right and again it's hard I mean this is this is the sort of subtle or influence on election\nIs pretty hard to evaluate as hard any poll\nTo suss out the extent to which this is an important factor but I think what is important about outlaw nomination is that it serves as a sport for people to get engaged in the election and this it looks like it's going to be very much a lesson about who turns out and to what extent they turn out I mean that's\nSounds like I'm being a normal dump political ... says [laughter] that's really true\nThat the election cycle because Mitt terms tend to favor Republicans but difficult in some of the vote more than Democrats\nThat the Democrats are so energized is the thing that sort of throwing things into disarray and sends pollsters are dependent on accurate estimates of who's going to turn out to vote\nIf you influence how many people come out the vote that throws off the polls that's something we saw on twenty sixteen right so the the the challenge here is gauging the extent to which people are going to be so aggravated by the town on I'm not necessarily gonna change your whole one or the other one is going to for them to come out to vote when they otherwise might not\nHave you been following this for some time so or going with what you see the numbers that you see\nA and do your own sense of the ground how do you think it's looking as we approach midterms well\nThe house is much less a question seems pretty likely the Democrats going to retake the house it's not a certainty in the same way the Hillary Clinton we elect our way and I wasn't a certain thing but it is certainly the case that Democrats are very well positioned both\nBecause of how are voters views Democrats versus Republicans but also just a lot of sort of structural things like the number of Republicans that have given up their incumbency\nAnd salt reelection the centers on much murkier question and the reason is not because on the Senate side people have a less partisan views it's simply a map the Democrats is so bad they're far more seat currently held by democratic incumbents that are up for reelection this year than there are Republican from that of course the function of the fact that\nSix years ago in those terms harder was two thousand well mannered and you're not a lot them as one in places where they might not otherwise have one so that's why this looks a lot for your for the Democrats my guess is that the Senate ends up probably about split\nOf course when the most interesting Senate races right here in Texas is one of many Philip bump is watching his national
