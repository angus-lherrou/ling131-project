I mean yes you can request an E. mail ballot but ... but mostly what's that what it is that what that is used for is what we call her ... voters which is\nMilitary and overseas stationed folks that is what it's intended for and it's intended to make a short cut so that they can quickly get their ballot but then there's there's no online voting all\nThey do is print out that ballot hand market put it in an envelope and mail it back so I wouldn't want people to think that they're sort of some sort of electronic option that's not going to happen for a while or not going to see voting on our phones or anything electronic voting until we figure out how to make the Internet more secure\nTravis County clerk day to day but why has joined us live on MORNING EDITION here on K U T Ninety point five on this Friday morning it is nine fifty four she is answering tons of listener questions about voting and the voting process we still have many more to get to somebody asked a question about\nCounting those absentee mail in ballots other ballots that are not cast during early voting or on election day how are those counted are they counted on election day or that counted later how does that work\nYes we start counting those on election day shortly before the polls closed at seven PM so that we can be all prepared to give her results right after seven o'clock so and all the ... votes that have gotten that have a ride by that time get reported in the election night reports now here's one of the things I Want to remind voters\nRemember that when you put your ballot in your ... and see like you have to sign across the ... in the back\nOne of the number one reasons why voters get disqualified from voting by mail is because they forget to sign the outside of their ... very important to do that\nOtherwise yes all of those absentee ballots are counted\nWe've got a lot of questions about registering as a member of a particular political party in Texas Texas is a little bit different than some other states where you do register as a member of a party but in Texas\nYou don't necessarily do that but we got a lot of questions like if I'm registered as an independent can I vote for a mixture of candidates are only independent candidates explain how the candidates are on the ballot and who can vote for which candidates right\nYou don't have to stick to any kind of party and as a matter of fact in Texas there's no way for you to register as a Democrat Republican or independent\nOr the way you get 'em as sort of a dumb ass a nation of the party affiliation is if you go and participate in one of the primaries Republican or Democrat or the caucus for the libertarians are Green's\nThat's the only distinction that will ever be made in your voting history about how you voted and of course nobody knows who voted for\nNow when you when you get to a November ballot it's all free choice you can vote for whoever you want you can switch between parties that is entirely up to you\nAnd and of course as we said before you can skip anything you're not completely sure about that if you're using the strike party option that's the only place where it's all going to be pre set for you otherwise go back and forth to your heart's content what\nAbout riding somebody in with these with these machines and the system how do you write in someone whose name does not appear on the ballot\nRight well we have a way to do that um if you click on the bride in a line it will pull up a an alphabet key for you\nAh so that you can type in the name of your candidate however only the names of certified candidates will be counted so if you ride in Donald Duck or you know your or your third grade art teacher none of that's going to carry out you're gonna have\nTo uh only use the names are certified and those can be found listed in your voting booths\nAnd they know we had some questions about participation and turnout what and I know that varies from year to year and from election season to election season but what is kind of usual average voter turnout like Travis County\nWell I think one of the things that where we can say about this election before it even happened is this is not going to be a normal election this will be a very high turnout for mid term and that's that's not normal\nWe think that we could seem more like presidential level turnout for for this election for both early voting and election day so that's the other reason why we're encouraging people vote early and consider voting in that middle period and over the weekend don't wait till the last minute because we do not want you to have to wait in line\nThe the main thing I think is a plan ahead sink about wins a good day for you to go vote and then head out that day with all your materials in hand you mentioned\nBallot security and election security no that's been on a lot of folks minds for years what is done what has been done what is being done to secure the voting process in ballots in Travis County\nRight well I'm I Am early so proud of Travis County commissioners court they fund elections appropriately and we're we're just not one of those counties where we have one of those problems and ever since the Russians came uh we've now picked up all of our efforts to make sure that the election system is\nIs you know protected in even more stringent ways than we used to in the past and the most important thing is that we are now paying very close attention to the um voter registration data base because it is connected to the Internet\nThe voting systems are not and we have established security procedures for the voting system and have had them for many many years so where we really added our extra effort is to protect voter registration\nTravis County clerk
