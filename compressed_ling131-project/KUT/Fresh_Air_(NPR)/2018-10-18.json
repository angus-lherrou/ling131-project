again thank you for joining us tonight ... news anchor at five in San Antonio\nAnd I'm Jason wanting political reporter and host of inside Texas politics WFAN Dallas Fort Worth but what about yours from across the state watching this debate lived tonight and all corners of Texas so let's get right to\nThat campaign that agreed to these roles tonight for each question the candidate will get Ninety seconds to answer his opponent will have Ninety seconds for a response and we will turn back for a final bottle of sixty seconds\nThat he opposed justice Gorsuch you poor oppose justice cabin on if you listen to what congressman O'Rourke said he said he wants justices agreed with his own left wing policy views\nThat's not the job of the court the job of the court is to follow the law if you don't want to change the law you don't throw elections you do it the constitution gives the power to the people not five unelected lawyers in Washington and let me know the same judges that congressman O'Rourke wants to see\nWhat also undermined the first amendment would undermine free speech would undermine religious liberty would undermine the second amendment Hillary Clinton promise to appoint justices who would undermine the second amendment and congressman O'Rourke enthusiastically supported her doing\nSenator that case I'm thank you very much\nSenator Cruz President Trump said on Sunday that something is changing in regards to the climate you're clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence\nTo back that up there's nothing that exist you have to back that up but major oil companies including Texas based Exxon Mobil says even on this website the risk of climate change is clear and wars action that's Exxon Mobil zone worse or so when you tell Texans companies who think this really is a problem\nWell is it of course the climate is changing the climate has been changing from the dawn of time to climate will change as long as we have a planet earth\nI'm I Am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers\nI Believe in science I share the science and space subcommittee in the Senate Commerce Committee and in the in that capacity I chaired a hearing looking on the science and data\nBehind global warming and we heard testimony we heard actual science and data far too many Democrats approach to this issue not as a matter of science I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence but instead what they approach it as as a matter of government power they want the power to control the economy\nThat has led for example congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful\nTo the people of Texas for example congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a ten dollar a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas\nThat would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas by the way it ten dollars a barrel that works out to about twenty four cents a gallon that every one of us would pay when you build fill up your car or truck\nThat would hurt the people of Texas and let me point out look a robust energy sector is good for all of Texas there are millions of jobs that depend on a robust oil and gas sector and and congressman O'Rourke record voting against Texas oil and gas voting against energy that\nHurts the economy it hurts jobs it it it's not right for Texas and let me point out all those oil and gas workers they buy homes\nThey buy cars and trucks they get health care that they gave the churches in schools and by the way the University of Texas to say and and get hundreds of millions of dollars for my energies that extra\nTime senator let's move on to another second response from Mr or Mrs what'd you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you he's going to\nMake up positions and boats that I've never held or ever take his dishonest for the president called them wind dead and it's why the nickname stuck because it's true\nUm what the climate is changing and man made climate change is a fact three hundred years after the enlightenment we shouldn't be able to listen to the scientists and follow the advice and guidance and they tell us that we still have the time\nBut the window is closing to get this right if we make our commitment to the generation that follow and not just think about the next election or or political career or pursuit of of the White House than than we can make the right decisions that we can support Texas\nBeing a proud energy leader in oil and gas but also in renewable energy today Texas leave the country we're number one in the nation and the generation of renewable wind power or number five and moving up quick when it comes to solar the fastest growing jobs in the states of America today\nWind and solar jobs we can continue to grow this economy we can reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy make sure\nThat we produce and refine and transport and use or energy resources more responsibly and listen this is one political party singing assistance people of both parties every single county in Texas that we've had the chance\nTo listen to people these are folks who work in the energy industry Amy and I were in Iran Texas listening to those who work in some of these fracking operations what they want is predictability consistency and the regulations and then they will perform to them cards from the time Mr Cruz sixty saccharin bottle washes those ExxonMobil had it wrong here\n[noise] well it it gets clear congressmen Iraq's pollsters have told them to come out on the attack so if he wants to insults me and calling me a liar that's fine but you know John Adams famously said facts\nAre stubborn things so if you want to see the votes he cast for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil though to our website it's Ted Cruz dot org and we won't put up the exact\nOf the vote and a link to Congress metal rock the vote against the people of Texas let me say if you work in energy if you work in oil and gas\nCongressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking aggressive regulations of exporting liquefied natural gas he's a prominent supporter of President Obama's\nParis climate deal which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas that's not good for taxes and it's an example of over and over again\nCongressman O'Rourke sides\nWith liberal extreme is on the national level instead of the people's taxes instead of jobs of Texas and and by the way under the under time\nAre great to Texas leads in energy across the board\nRepresented had this question about immigration policy and we know your position and passion for the dreamers\nAnd we know that you are adamantly against extending the existing border fence this question here is that sets a play about border security if we don't need a border wall can you please look at the ... and tell them what are we giving me\nI'd be happy to and listen I don't know that there is another person who has a greater stake in this issue than I Do I mean are raising Ulysses and Molly and entering\nIn El Paso Texas a one half of the largest binational community on the border the defining border community we care about our safety I care about the safety of those that are representing Congress I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas el ...\nWe've served exactly the same length of time in Congress and those six years\nI have authored in past thirty four separate pieces of legislation major victories for the American people but he asked where the results up point to one front and center\nWhich is a historic tax cuts that I spent thousands of hours bringing senators together getting past and he said where are the result the state of Texas is booming we've got right now\nThe lowest unemployment theme forty nine years\nAfrican American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been rewarded Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been recorded usa unemployment is the lowest in fifty two years\nTexas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes he said in response to help ... medicine higher taxes that's not\nThe very wrong representative art and you said four and a Fifteen billion dollars to help victims of Hurricane Harvey but two weeks after that he voted against a bill that would have also getting them\nRelate what the account those victims who are still struggling financially today one year later\nI've been with many of those who are affected by Harvey and the immediate aftermath going to places like rock Porter reporter Iran's is\nHouston Beaumont Port Arthur and continue to come back again and again to see what we can do to be helpful and voted for more than a hundred and thirty six billion dollars in aid to support those communities who have been hit by natural disasters including Harvey\nAnd then the specific build that you asked about the the tax relief was not as great as we've seen for those who have been through other natural disasters I thought we could get\nA better deal but I Am there for those communities each and every single day I continue to go back to places like Kashmir gardens in Houston, Texas which is more than a year later is still not\nFully rebuilt and I continue to wonder why Sen Cruz voted against more than twelve billion dollars in FEMA preparedness knowing full well that we will see more Harvey is going forward mind you that was the third five hundred year flood\nAnd just the last five years we know that there will be more of these floods coming and I want to make sure that the people of Texas especially southeast Texas are prepared for the next one that twelve billion dollars also included hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn support for volunteer fire departments like the one that I visited in Rockport where those twenty volunteer firefighters more than half lost all of their worldly possessions and were sleeping on the floor in the firehouse as they responded to the emergencies\nIn their community so yes I Will be our work with anyone anytime anywhere to make sure that those Texans who need the help to rebuild get it and we invest in their ability to be resilient\n... sign thank you senator has Ninety seconds to respond to that\nHouston's my hometown Hurricane Harvey hit Texas unlike any disaster we've ever seen it it was devastating I was home with\nWith Heidi and my girls during the hurricane and and and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast two three four five times working with the state and local officials I mentioned earlier a hundred and Seventy one sheriff's have endorsed my campaign including\nTen Democrats one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority elected share some endorse my campaign is because many of those shares I've worked with hand in hand after Harvey and the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills\nWorking hand in hand with John Cornyn where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills and the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored I authored introduced passed into law did it jointly with John Cornyn Marco Rubio the cruise Cornyn Rubio emergency tax\nRelief gave over five billion dollars in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey hit passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly was signed into law provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey\nOnly for Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation\nOne of them was congressman O'Rourke congressmen from El Paso and there was a reason for that you know he gave an answer now he said that it didn't provide enough tax relief\nThat's not what he said at the time he voted down at the time he voted now he said the reason he voted now is that he wanted he he wanted to legal immigration and say that again that was his answer at the time\nAnd it hasn't wrestling thank you send a representative you get to the second story but on the ... vote\nI don't I I Will always say what I can do work with anyone anytime anywhere to do better for Texas and that that was what I was trying to do but you know Senator Cruz mentioned listening to and working with local leaders in Houston I'm I've listened to and worked with\nThe mayor and the county judge a Democrat and Republican each of whom is still waiting for one point one billion dollars awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding but it's still not made its way into the neighborhoods into the streets into the homes into the businesses to rebuild\nThey need a fulltime center not somebody running for president is going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets her\nThey need a fulltime center who had been back for them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified\nNeeded funding but they needed a senator who is going to work for them Army Corps of engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because it wasn't in Texas He wasn't too since he was in Iowa he was in New Hampshire he was running for another office instead of taking care of the concerns\nAnd the needs of the people were thinking that Senator Cruz a year ago this week October Eighteenth twenty Seventeen you tweeted the following statement\nWhen it comes to the deficit and debt it is immoral that debt we have and we have to turn it around you wrote your two months later last December as you just mentioned a moment ago you voted for the Republican tax plan\nThat the joint committee on taxation congressional budget office and many other nonpartisan say left more than a trillion dollars to the deficit some people see the tweet and the vote as hypocritical hardly not\nThey are not remotely I'm proud to supported the tax cut the tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas in for the country we're seeing record growth we're seeing record low unemployment if its benefit for a million new jobs\nIn the last two years and and by the way one thing that that that Democrats never seem to understand if you want to pay down deficit and debt and I care passionately about the deficit and debt it is in moral the deficit and debt we've racked up if you want to do it the only four strong enough to do that\nIs economic growth\nNow let's go back to a little history in the Nineteen sixties John F. Kennedy a Democrat campaign on tax cuts cutting individual tax cuts and the corporate tax rate a set of rising tide will lift all boats he passed it\nAnd the economy boomed and federal tax revenue went up in the Nineteen eighties Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes to get the economy growing he passed it\nThe economy boomed in federal tax revenues went up we did the same thing this time this time with that tax cut we're seeing the results and today to date federal tax revenues have gone up since tax\nRevenues are higher in it this year than they were last year without the tax\nComes ... which would Iowa I've heard you on the campaign trail for since Twain twelve saying how bad the deficit and and this vote would add to the deficit\n... case and know what that projection is wrong by the way that projection also would have said that the Kennedy tax cuts would have added to the deficit and the written tax cuts would add to the deficit the reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spur the economy the reason we have deficit and debt\nIs because Congress keep spending that's been out of the term limits it's why we need to pass a balanced budget that we need to stop the roles that lives on things like social costs that are on there or not he second response\nSpeaking a balanced budgets I'm only one of us\nAs with good friends in El Paso started a small business\nUm met the payroll every week balance the books made sure that we delivered for our clients only one of us has served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted with a ... a share of responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass a every single year\nWe did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two trillion dollars and those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash\nAnd the already wealthy in a country that has ribbon with income inequality unseen since the last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action\nCommittees who represent the corporate interests benefited from this tax cut why does the vote for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence\nEvery year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee\nContributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain\nThe reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become I don't take that back money not a done I resent the people of Texas congressman that as your time Senator Cruz sixty seconds about you\nKnow congressman O'Rourke is so fond of saying he doesn't take pac money but but the truth is different for example the J Street pac which is a rabidly anti Israel pack has raised over a hundred and sixty thousand dollars for congressman O'Rourke because of his many votes against the nation of Israel\nAnother example he has a superPAC based up in Dallas that that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars is bending them on ads attacking me and my family so and he said he doesn't doesn't take pac money just let others do it\nFor him but let me say more fundamental\nTrue we lose a whole lot of money so we had marketplaces ...
