it breaks democracy that's the question of an ice knows asked in his latest piece in the New Yorker we'll talk about how data breaches and the Russian disinformation campaign and twenty sixteen have put Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg under scrutiny as the mid term elections approach\nThe tools by which Facebook is held accountable or not the tools that we use in politics it's not like you vote the bums out this is a case in which a private company is making profound choices about the contours and the boundaries of political expression and we don't have obvious tools with which to regulate\nLives here about how Facebook became vulnerable to spreading disinformation has ... is attempting to combat fake news and the inherent problems in monitoring political content without violating users free speech that's some fresh air\nFirst news live from NPR News in Washington I'm jak spear three key Republican senators still have not announced whether or not they will support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but as NPR's Scott Detrow explains one of the few remaining undecided Democrats said she will vote no\nThey first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered\nWhether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they have to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing new populations people who wouldn't otherwise have been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries\nAround the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they crossed this barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nBut it did something even more important which was the ...\nThe sacred importance really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as of this former Facebook executive said to me it was really a cool crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was ... was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when Facebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that maybe you want to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could pitch in to Facebook and use it\nThey made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own sight were actually gonna try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the\nYou know the way that everybody went on on to their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of ah of developers of programmers than they otherwise would end this turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to\nAnd what we all now know is the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they've done was they allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold that data to the political consultancy known as\nCambridge Analytica and that to the back door the way in which that data went out the door or has created much of the crisis that now engulf the company today\nAnd you write that the executive within Facebook Cindy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved him a Sandy Park illicit joined Facebook at twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're\nNow where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this\nFeeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit to go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told\nA that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that data that they didn't really want to discover the full reach a and and Sandy Park hill is left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be perfect because exactly the kind of undisciplined usa data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing response of [noise]\nYes exactly as he said that you know I needed people I needed engineers to help me try to police where they said it was going with all of the resources we're going to grow he said at some point\nAnd he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was say\nWhat are some of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they begin to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto play video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that at and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um we're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out\nUh it really became a powerful new ingredient in a dangerous new ingredient in some cases into these longstanding ethnic and religious rivalries I'm\nIn Myanmar for instance when Facebook arrived it really became an affect the Internet that there was only about one percent of the population that was on line before Facebook was there and then over the course of the next few years\nIt grew rapidly and um and people who were interested in fomenting this kind of ethnic hatred between Buddhists and Muslims\nFigured out how to use Facebook to great effect and they would spread hoaxes or rumors and in there were cases where a rumor hoax that was spread on Facebook directly contributed to the outbreak of a riot and and what you heard over that period was the people in Myanmar\nBegan to talk to the company warned the company that this was a problem as early as twenty Thirteen people began visiting Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park giving slide presentation talking about\nThe problem of ah ethnic violence being trafficked on Facebook and the and the company would listen and in some cases they would give a hearing to that\nNew and it would be over the years they continue to visit activists and technology entrepreneurs for me and more but they didn't see any fundamental change and and and they start every time they went they would they would hear very often the same message which was we're going to hire\nDozens of Burmese language speakers to be able to police this kind of thing more effectively but still fundamentally it didn't change and [noise]\nAnd eventually it became so pronounced the role of Facebook as a catalyst in this violence became so serious that ah earlier this year at the un investigator in charge of I'm probing the persecution of there were hanged Muslim minority in Myanmar described the role of Facebook as in her words\nA beast she said it has become something that it was never intended it and is actively contributing\nTo this what the un now considers the genocide\n... did you talk to Mark Zuckerberg about this\nI did and I asked him about it and and and at first he was he was a frankly a little clip about it he said look this is a problem that is similar in a lot of places and it's one that we're that we're dealing with I'm paraphrasing there and I I pushed him I said well I talked to people in me andme are just a yesterday in fact um [noise]\nAnd they're baffled about why a company as big as as rich and as innovative as Facebook has been unable to deal with this problem\nAnd what he said was we take this seriously we we really do understand this is a problem but it's not something in which you can just snap your fingers and solve it\nOvernight it takes a process you have to build out these systems in order to allow artificial intelligence to detect hate speech and then hire the kinds of people who can\nWho can solve the problem he ... he said that they are going to have\nOver a hundred people a Burmese speakers who are going to be policing um the ah Facebook in ... but I think it speaks to a broader a broader dynamic at work here with which is that\nFor a long time as one of march afterwards friends said to me when there were complaints about the company\nHe either thought that these were just let heights these were people who are slow to embrace technology or in other cases they were exaggerating are overstating the role that Facebook was playing he looked at a place like me and Martin said well they were probably going to be fighting anyway I'm I'm putting words in his mouth or this or not words he said to me [noise]\nBut I think over time he has come to this realization in by his own description of belated realization that Facebook is not just a tool on the table is not just an of a new implement it is in fact a fundamental and very ... by its nature it has\nTo be responsible for the forces they did on leashes\nUm but then building the systems to try to get control of this is is hard and they have moved much more slowly than they should have a in some cases by their own admission\nLet's talk about the twenty sixteen elections um did Facebook was when the election was approaching see this as a big revenue opportunity\nThey did they saw this as a an important moment they Sheryl Sandberg and call with investors and analysts\nCompared it to the world cup or the super bowl was the chief operating officer of you know she is yeah she's sort of arguably the second most powerful person at Facebook and and and what she said was this was going to be a major opportunity for them to sell ads a political ads the projections at the time were that\nAs candidates and political organizations became more aware of the importance of the Internet that they were going to shift a lot of their spending from television into the Internet and that that you were going to see a a nine or ten fold increase in how much spending was going to be available and Facebook want it to be a big recipient of that\nRight and it had gotten the special exemption 'em to print ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so so that was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding you know that point at the end where they say who who paid for the ...\nThey said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're new technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new innovation but as a result that meant that he was\nIn a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics\nWhere in many cases of mysterious orange and it was very hard to know who was posting them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed a Facebook employee with both Clinton and Trump campaigns to help the campaigns use the platform effectively how did they respond\n[noise] well the Clinton campaign or rejected the offer um [noise]\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embraced it eagerly they were much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped some craft their messages they help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background\nColor or changing the texture the font how that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate so later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa hung said\nTo an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role in the process\nHow did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress turnout among constituencies that they expected to be important to the Democrats including African Americans and young liberals and and white women and\n... by by targeting that population using these incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their success and they've talked about it ever since\nI have an ... is a staff writer for the New Yorker we'll talk some more after a short break this is fresh air\nListening to fresh air here on often NPR station K U
