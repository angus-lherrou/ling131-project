rewarding to see them\nTake what you you teach them this daycare runs on tight margins and rolled down says it's hard to stay competitive with pay\nWe you know barely make it so anything that could help us in the expensive side of things it's really helpful\nOfficials in Massachusetts are hoping a new pilot program could help roll down squeeze a little more room into her budget by making the supplies and services she needs like a recent roofer ... a little more affordable\nThan India Bala as with the United way of Massachusetts Bay the organization coordinating the effort\nWe created a model where they could share practices information and even things like back office operations\nParticipating daycare centers get access to a website where they can find discounted rate for everything from office supplies to accounting services basically the program treats the Elizabeth Peabody house and eleven other daycare providers like one big purchasing group that means more business for participating vendors\nFor almost a year end and we will continue to grow and expand that\nWe shared services model is still in the pilots stage in Massachusetts but in neighboring New Hampshire these purchasing groups are now common with more than two hundred participating providers it costs the state about a half a million dollars a year to run the program it saves daycare providers five to ten thousand dollars a year\nAnd ... says most have been using that money to invest in their workers\nThey are using them um to stabilize salary is to be able to provide raised this offer them discounts in savings\nPaying workers so they stay on longer saves money on hiring and training Marcy white book because with the center for the study of childcare employment at the University of California Berkeley she says daycares nationwide or trying everything from housing stipend to tuition reimbursement to retain staff\nThe strategies have been filled the bucket was a hole in the bottom of it but we haven't really restructured have these programs work\nSince the child care sector is mostly private keeping these competitive doesn't leave much room for increasing worker pay which is problematic because someone with similar credentials can make about twice as much working in a public school you\nReally do need to figure out how to transform the way we finance this\nFor now these shared

will be blood and moody teenager and Little Miss sunshine and portrayed Brian Wilson in love and mercy dino co wrote and directed the new film adaptation of Richard forwards novel wildlife\nAbout a teenager who's unmoored watching his parents' marriage fall apart and doesn't know who to side with\nJake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan play the parents the story reminded they know about what he experienced when his parents' marriage started to unravel\nI think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about a kid rebels\nFor me I remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nAnd Kevin White had reviews re issue of music mine you know road\nFirst news\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is\nAs great writing can do or a great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and that I just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen your home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nYou know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nReally close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles in that relationship sort of what a profound\nAnd I guess difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loves in our life and because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle in our life and he was able to capture that with compassion\nIn that clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe how awkward is that asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents live you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something I related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid rebels writer or something from their use that for me I remember sort of standing in the middle feeling the ground shake and not wanting things to tip\nSo Joe and I have something in common and and Richard for it and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so it was something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I wouldn't have said you know I'm ... you know out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and and then we can help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is on the on the film half resume living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we did not always lived together\nYou were fourteen when your parents separated the character and wildlife is sixteen and the novel yeah but he's fourteen in the movie did you make them fourteen in the movie 'cause that was your age when your parents have\nRead them fourteen because that's when I moved to a new town as the Brunson family does in the film and\nFelt like where I was emotionally connected to a time in my life I wouldn't say that's officially when my parents separated I think it was actually previous to that there was some ins and outs in the relationship I'm so for me that was like spiritually the right age to sort of put myself into the story\nAnother a kind of see him in the book is that this fourteen or sixteen year old boy is getting different narratives from his mother and his father as they're going through this turbulent period of their marriage and he has to decide who's right who to believe and\nUm that's really tricky when you love both your parents and they're telling a different stories about what your future is going to be like is that something that you relate to also\nAbsolutely and that actually you've now reminded me of probably my the most exciting first hit I got on the book was this feeling of the mystery of who are parents are\nDo do do you know when you suddenly realize like they are past life without the problems are that they're real people you know and and sort of seeing them as a\nWhole people which means they're flawed people that was exciting to me I I sort of had to get to know Jerry Anne Janette better probably as a means of understanding my own experience maybe being put in the middle as you say but especially Jeannette I was like this woman is so complicated the mysterious and\nAnd sexual yeah which is I think also really difficult for the teenager to deal with especially because she kind of includes him in a direction that she's doing\nYes and and I how I feel about that as this woman has probably been a good mother for fourteen years and the good wife and I think the dad has tried in in in his way and I think they've done their best in many ways but suddenly like one day the rug pulled out from under you the charade is up and\nIt's just like this kid is sort of being kicked out into the wild right you know it's like okay time's up you this is welcome to the real world\n[noise] so you directly asked Richard Ford for rights to adapt his novel wildlife into a movie and he wrote back to you in a letter he wrote back is included or at least excerpted in the press kits for your movie I'd like you to read that letter it's a great letter\n[noise] I'm grateful to you for your interest in my book but I should also say this in hopes of actually encouraging you\nMy book is my book your picture were you to make it as your picture you we're moviemakers fidelity to my novel is of no great concern to me a stylish our own values means go read the book behind so it doesn't get in the way\nThanks for reading that show was that liberating to read that like the writer of the book is saying do your thing I'm okay\nI could not have written something better myself that you would want somebody like that to say to you I I was shocked and moved it is an incredible but of wisdom and permission so\nConsidering how much I'm Meyer is writing in general and especially how much this book movement and how much it meant to me to have that sense of permission was incredibly important\nWhere there are lines from the book\nThat you wanted to make sure we're in the movie\nAnd there's no voice over so it all the lines are dial up\nThat's right so the book is first person and actually looking back on the event very tempting to use voice over especially because the language is\nSee if you take a lot of abuse there's actually a fairly seamless on YouTube there's a whole like real of you getting beaten up in different films including twelve years a slave there will be blood forgetting what else is was in there but anyway you've gotten beaten up a lot\nIn your movies and in some of those you scream as you're being beaten up and you have different kinds of talk about different kinds of screens for different circumstance is because you have like really high pitched screams like deeper screams and now during softer screams\nAnd that's very fun it's fun to build a character and I think that you do ask yourself\nWhere the energy in this person's body for example right or their shoulders you know a little bit more back than mine and then I think the same with the voice you know you asked yourself how does this person who live in the front or the back or ... you have the throat yeah or the mouse or the\nUm and I mean it's really small subtle you know stuff but at least ask the questions and maybe try to you know\nThe questions you asked is this character stay strong or did they become a week when they're being being\nEnsure and are they injuries there are they enjoying this are they you know terrified what what's the how does that affect the screen [noise]\nUm well usually at that point you've tried to lay the groundwork so that when the moment comes it comes to the way it's meant to or you know so I don't know that I Would intellectual lives like but but certainly something I may think about is um\nLike for example one of the times you're talking about as prisoners um some called prisoners and\nYou know that person was somebody who was we'd be traumatized and these are very young age and I felt like his body was sort of frozen um you know the way that you react when you're scared your shoulders go up a little bit you know your neck gets a little tight and so then you know carrying\nThe history and just the body hold that information your body does you know it's a holding some of your history you're emotional life and and it does for all of us and and that is a part of the voice\nYou weren't directed ate at age twenty two by one of the greatest directors of our time about how much Anderson where there's things you learned from him about directing about how to work with actors um that you try to\nUm carries through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\nYeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors in his crew he has a an incredible eye for detail I think it's definitely been important for me um I've been wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to seen directors like this go to work\nMeaning to see them wait for the oil trip to be right even though time and money is you know burning\nI remember one time or in a costume fitting you know him noticing something in the stitching the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of the focus the care\nAnd the integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm able to enjoy their work and and ... have a moment of fun probably too but I absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with a common theme is really um hard work\nThat took about your film love and mercy and this is a story of Brian Wilson most famous for for each portion of course for his solo albums and I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version you ... when he's younger\nGetting the beach boys era\nAnd then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues and I'm listening that part is played by John cue sat so I Want to pay scene from love and mercy\nYou've been in this scene writing a God only knows great song and you play it for your father and if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's very authoritarian with his sons and\nI'm very hypercritical nothing's ever good enough for him\nAnd so you're playing the song for him while he's sitting\nAnd looking very tense and smoking his pipe\nTo here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from Marcy\nIn the\n\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over there\nSo rough I Know but it's getting there it's ripe for cross was [noise]\nSee I mean it'll get better that the vocals will counterpoint the backing track real Sal\nSo you don't want my advice or my lovely\nWas telling me what you think [noise] much usually\nI'm living on her own\n[laughter] we're still family [noise]\nDamaged on fire their own father\nWho don't want to start again from arguing I say something that you argue but don't say anything\nYou don't like the song I never said that I can tell\nI Would change the title\nThe country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five\nDid you close your eyes look I asked you to tell me and I think [noise] if you close your eyes place\nIt's like being blind but because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking about\nI close my eyes students here say\n[noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with the right arrangement\nWhere you live French horns on it and flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\nFrankly if you really want to know I don't care for it\nTo wishy washy if you lead me why leave me\nLife will go on why go on living\nIt's not like a beach voice on your brothers are going to have a love song suicide note as you say it could be something with the right arrangement well I gave it another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\n[noise] so that's my guess Latino and bill camp in a scene from love and mercy\nBefore they know is Brenda Wilson and bill camp as his father Murray Wilson\nReally upsetting seen I mean God only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's very upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way that approximate at a brain loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I had seen you actually playing of course\nYeah and that's ... that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just insane\nYou used to be in a band called moved in your guitar is ... um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music\nListening to it ah is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly ... and smile I don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you had so much light in him\nAnd he met him yes yeah and when he when we talked about music she still felt like a school boy about it you know and you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by lightning side of him I mean you know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal\nWhich is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in the scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know um it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's just um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd recounted totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes\nIn love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teaches the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing\nPrescription loyalty is is uh the greatest law", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "25"}
