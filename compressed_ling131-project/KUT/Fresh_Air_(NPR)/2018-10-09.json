[noise]\nWell see that's coming up on fresh air\nVersus news live from NPR News in Washington I'm ... beer\n[laughter] you know first of all I'm just so struck by hearing my father's voice which I I seem to be listening to almost more than I ever did even when he was alive [noise]\nUm I Love his poetry I Love his words I Love the way he marshals language I Am a I'm weary of discussing my father I always have been especially when you have a a person who\nHad such an inevitable wave and command of language so I'm hesitant and I I didn't even know whether I should I I'm not certain I should be speaking about him\nBut um but it's a stirring subject and um I have been enlisted time enlisted in the\nIn the campaign to let everybody know how wonderful I think he was [noise]\nDo you feel protective of his privacy cash in my opinion like your father was very\nUm elliptical\nAnd has writing and at pretty private about his life he alluded to a lot of things in his sons but\nNever quite came out and send them in a direct way\nOh I I I'm not certain that's that's true in terms of the use of the word direct uh\nOkay but I Will say that um\nTo speak on his behalf feels like a little bit of a transgression [laughter] you know you have a man who has designed is life around trying to not demystify a process um and uh his work really does speak for itself [noise]\nSo you know of course I urge people to just consulted if they're interested in it ah it's it yes it's complete with\nContradictions you know you go from things that are actually quite direct to things that are mysterious and elusive and designed to be transcended because of it um but he was preoccupied with the uh the broken this of things the or the symmetry of things [noise]\nYou know as he says forget your perfect offering [noise]\nThere's a crack in everything or in his most famous some hallelujah it doesn't matter what you heard a whole year the broken hallelujah so he was always preoccupied with the idea of the imperfection of things\nYeah there's there's a crack and everything and that's that's where the light gets in I don't have that line exactly at my fingertips but I mean it\nIs yeah yeah ring the bells that still can wring forget your perfect offering there is a crack in everything that's how the light gets and\nYeah so tell like whatever like can get through the crack has you know I mean you see the light but he sees the thing that only has a crack that led to the light and ... you know the ... they always had the duality of everything is I think what I'm trying to say [noise] um [noise] so\nOh yeah I I I remember him dancing so beautifully around these kinds of questions which I think he uh was irritated by [laughter]\nVery core and when I say that I don't mean to be disparaging the person I'm constructing the questions I think it's natural for us to be curious and to articulate our concerns or thoughts are our questions\nBut I think it's also natural for the quote unquote artists to preserve the kind of mystery I'm seemed to not talk about the mechanics almost like a porno you know this goes in here that goes in there there's something bigger than the mechanics and that is the end\nThe end result the stirring quality of of what is the result of an artist at work\nAnd um you know I think he uh has he said you know I put my paper had on my concussion and dance he tried on many occasions to to dance around questions or a cooperate Tibet as best he could and I feel like such a shabby posture trying to\nUm be the ... for him you know the ambassador of this particular book which I had very little to do with frankly others and\nOffering a title for it or he wrote a very\nEloquent introduction which I Will be quoting as time goes on here [laughter]\nThank you so I ... I think you've said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with him I mean you're you're slapped me like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins and pages and his pocket you found a notebook in the freezer and one's um so what what are you dealing with the findings\nWell it's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a from the simplest point of view there's the are the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity\nThen there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book\nUm and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I ha I produced his last record the cold you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red\nSometimes to a mere kicked Trump you know just from meter per tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to play the title song on the final album that was released when your father ... Khan was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on hand and this is it's like and I say it's a great song [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] she means [noise] you've signed is mindlessly do you want us to talk [noise] [noise]\n\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd the human brain [noise]\nMillion candles and burning fool's game [noise] you want to do [noise]\n\n\nI remember him composing hallelujah you\nRemember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took him twelve years [laughter]\nSo you know it started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there with a ... string guitar in his underwear and I'm there to always be versus to consult on that I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time didn't want to put out\n... isn't that amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you buy those too if you buy that unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to into my forties um the whole canon of his work is is living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you say there's ... there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four\nBut did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed cache of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nThat is the popular a poem states of calm is never finished but rather abandoned\n[laughter] do you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm frustration\nWas expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I said he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd uh and gave up\nAn enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised norm is amount or go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you quote that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought desk thought and that's often attribute it to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter]\nYeah he he edited and take the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic it was a constant process of filtration and refinement for certain so why why\nDon't we hear hallelujah fathers for sure\n[laughter] this is Leonard yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right you got to actually transgression yet refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something or you know where's the beef give some other songs that chance to get place [laughter] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has an hallelujah I think I think I'll play in any way you okay with that oh God I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay there it is\nAnd\nDo\nReally\nDo [noise]\n\nThat's Leonard Cohen singing hallelujah and my guess is when it comes son Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion immensely published Leonard clone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called the flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people that recorded hallelujah\nAnd um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of how I think there was a period of years when your father is genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit for that\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied uh it was a seeker\nWasn't satisfied was either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people who have chosen to be around him\nHe wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm and through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction he somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across\nAnd um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this shabby little life\nAnd his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected\nAbility to fill you know twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and uh [noise]\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think the jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in my life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and she sings a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as a benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone I\nEnjoy your solitude and I felt like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone in July your solid team\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude and so I made a blood ... actually the the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful well this is a man who has he says and I think you've you've just played it um you know although we had a reputation as a ladies' man you know he was\nHe had the greatest teeth to ten thousand nights you spent alone he understood something about so to\nLet me re introduce you
