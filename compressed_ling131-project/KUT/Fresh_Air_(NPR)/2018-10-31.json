compliment can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter]\nDo you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life and marine car again reviews above a bath and murder of fourteen\nYear old Emmett Till in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi which helped lead to the civil rights movement [noise]\nFirst new\nWell also want to clear and I don't want to know like um condemning the the art of something I I Want to them in there and kind of sexism and disrespect\nRight which is very deliberate and the difficulty of watching it is deliberate\nAt times and also these young men are also very there for one another and my point is that things aren't so black and white people can do horrible things and still do kinds of things people can do ... things instilled do horrible things\nThese kids in danger one another's lives very seriously and they're also asleep at the hospital when they wake up\nAnd I'm not judging these characters is not my job to judge them\nI wanted to show for better or for worse how people spoke and behave in the mid Nineteen nineties in this culture\n[noise] so the teenagers who you cast as the skaters in the film most of them seem like they're like professional skate boarders say they skating competitions they represent various um companies how'd you find them\n[noise] um there's a young man who worked on moving him Mikey Alfred who are we made a co producer who owns a skate company in LA and he ah brought a lot of local Los Angeles skate boarders into audition as well as I went to skate parks and did my own research\nBut a lot of these kids came from him being in the skate scene in Los Angeles and bringing in tons of people and\nI guess me seeing the potential for these young skate boarders as actors\nI saw how bombastic how funny how smart how damaged how raw how joyous how painful the soles in lives are of the people that I noticed within this world which made me even want to tell the story in the first place\n[noise] my impression watching the movie is that a lot of the lines might have been improvised that you might have said here's the basic stuff I Want you to communicate with say your way\nBecause you know a lot of what they're saying to each other isn't really about the content of what they're saying it's more about the attitude and there's a lot of expletives in it and like some of it on the page would it do you know what I mean I like I wasn't sure if you were writing that out word for word if you were saying just like go with it and then filming and editing\nI take that as a massive complement because that style of writing is so deliberate and I wanted the kids to improvise but they were obsessed with becoming great actors and becoming these characters and learning this screenplay and for me it took three years in twenty draft you\nDeliberately right every I'm In like an expletive\nWithin reason behind it well really and uh-huh\nAnd that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue that seems improvise is a complement to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought and how these people speak to one another [noise]\nDid you learn to speak that way\n[noise] yes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express\nYour feelings are you expressed at something hurts you then you should be made fun of and that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nBut the thing is like you or as a child and then as a young teen you were writing like skips for The Simpsons I'm not on a professional level you you were just\nWriting it's for The Simpsons so you only had both ambition and also a a facility for words you lived in a world of words\nYou wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking one must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes referring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time feel like but you're not supposed to express yourself because you're a boy\n[noise] yeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend horse yeah but no\nLess you you're kind of suppressing something that came really natural to you that you really valued\nRight and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own and security as a person and\nAs a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life after just brother person uncle for stuff like that first occupation I Would lift it would be a writer\nAnd then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked and then on top of that\nYou know even when I became a well known public figure I think the reality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff allowed for jokes and punches to be made about me and towards me\nTurned me angry here which made me communicate worse and then when you're funny you become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to hurt the other person 'cause you assume they're about to hurt you\nIt all plays into each other in this very weird cyclical thing and then I became famous as an overweight comedian and then I felt like\nSkateboarding so um we were talking about loving movies wanting\nTo write and to direct how did you start acting and how old were you when you started to realize not only wanted to do it but that you were good at\nWashing their two very different answers to that question my goal my whole life was to be a writer and director to say this is a dream what's happening now is like an understatement um\nAnd when I went to new school in New York I Would write these one act play and we would often put them up in bars and um when I Would have actors read I had really bad bedside manner because I didn't understand\nWhy they wouldn't do it in the way that you wrote it and my friend pulled me aside really generously as a good friend and was like look like you need to learn how to talk to actors they don't like\nThey don't like auditioning you know and they don't like working with you and so I took an acting class\nTo learn how I'd want to be spoken to\nAs an actor so maybe I could speak more eloquently and lovingly towards actors and I was such an insecure person that I got such positive feedback in the acting class\nThat have derailed me for sixteen years [laughter] and and in this amazing derailment in this amazing education\nIn film and film school and also finding a new expression that is another creative expression that I Love\nThat is so interesting that you really wanted to direct and you took the acting class just to learn how to speak with her to actors that's that's weird that's crazy that's interesting\nA complement can reroute you for sixteen years [laughter]\nDo you find the right complement for the right insecure person and they can change your life did you agree that you were good\nYes I Am struggle with taking complements ah my instinct is to make a joke or say no\nI'm but where I'm at in my life is I don't really want to be so negative towards myself and try and be kind to myself and the truth is I I I did think I always get it acting mhm\n[noise] and then is it fair to say that you kind of found a different kind of try and then the skateboarding try that you found like maybe your real tribe was Judd Apatow circle of actors and writers even though you weren't in freaks and geeks you are in so many Judd Apatow directed and produced movies\nHow did you become part of the ... tribe\nWell I met actually the catching a dry hired a mid nineties Alison Jones is judge casting director and that's why I hired her for my first film because she she's the one who introduced me to judge I after I did I heard how could these I met some casting directors\nBecause uh you know I got like an Asian off of that and then ... and introduced me to judge and brought me into read for that little one line in four year old virgin and I don't know then I stuck around\n[noise] so there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about this this line fits so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to gas line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] you're you're you're a high school kid and this and\nYou know you're not part of the cool crowd and all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series MANIAC I love her yeah I ... from a distance I Love her to\n[laughter] from the decision if you're already has the honor for as a person because she is a an actor\nGood good good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just how you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero\nAnd so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character a about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version of this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say\nYou know how girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy we can be that mistake\nSo gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about ... teenage boys an adult men kind of get girls and women trunk or drug did to get them into bad\nI mean it's literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... hated that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping with him\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and\nI didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time in the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at us times change that was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you awful [laughter]\nBut it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I\nNot that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity to understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought about as a reality 'cause it's not my experience\nAnd so now thinking of that as a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise] so um\nSo it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I ... I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\n[noise] why don't we take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but he's now a director and screenwriter his directorial debut is called mid nineties we'll be right back\nAnd this was a huge she Ninety point five support comes from Austin owned invisible fans twenty two years dedicated to keeping Austin's dogs and cats safe at home using technology both indoors and outdoors solutions designed to fit each need and budget details invisible fence dot com support comes from\nBlood blood donations have been saving lives locally since Nineteen fifty one donations decrease around Thanksgiving but the need for local hospitals often increases learn how to help if we are blood daughter word mhm\nMm support for NPR comes from the station and from YouTube originals and roadside attraction presenting fiber club starring Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free her captured journalists son also starting met bummer in ... in theaters friday [noise]\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home project from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill you know him as an actor but now he's a screenwriter and director ... directorial debut is called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past ... Latino bunch of years five six seven years you've started playing more dramatic roles you know in films like will for Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out\nTo film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic low it's just\nBy choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love that um was a great experience with John ... who told me\nFor buyers predictable payments over a long period of time made homeownership more affordable but for banks a thirty year mortgage with a fixed interest rate didn't make a lot of sense the interest they had to pay to deposit or isn't to borrow money wasn't fixed\nSo in the Nineteen seventies Congress took care of that problem it authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages from lenders taking the risk off their books\nSo again we have some government intervention that okay I I I have no problem making a thirty year alone because I Know Fannie and Freddie or going by it\nAnd that in a nutshell is how the thirty year mortgage became king but maybe it shouldn't be don't forget\nThe thirty year term did not come down on a tablet engraved you know that says Thirty years is the right number\nEight yeah eyes Edward pinto says for starters the thirty year mortgage pushes up home prices by making it easier for buyers to manage a bigger alone they end up paying a lot more interest over the life of the loan and\nThe amount of principle relatives interest is very small and it takes a very long time to build up equity\nOkay that at this point the thirty year is so ingrained in the home buying system
