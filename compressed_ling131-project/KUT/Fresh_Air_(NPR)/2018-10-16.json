folks you talk to you have about maybe selling those policies or do they need the money in the moment and and that's what they did\nNeither of them and that I spoke with had any regrets about this they both said it was the best financial decision they made it in that moment and to this day my sense is that is that yes you know they were able to access large amounts of cash that would have never right otherwise been able to um realize\nThat that's why thank you for having me [noise]\n\n\nWe've got a whole raft of farmers we talked to on this program we've got a corn farmer hog guy a chicken\nGuy apples two out of Washington state and every time we've talked to in the past couple of months but American tariffs on Chinese imports and then the retaliatory Chinese tariffs on American exports a lot of which are agriculture they say they need those exports to make the businesses work and even when the White House announced back in August it was going to offer twelve billion dollars\nIn farm aid to mitigate some of those losses they said they would much rather just have the market work\nAbout a tenth of that ... billion dollars is going to go to buying crops that probably

million more pounds of food this season from the tariffs program and an unusually bountiful harvest all of it will require extra money for transportation fuel and storage Richards is seeking three

need to talk about any additional assistance program\nBut even if this program is one and done Feeding America as carry Calvert says this year spike and supplies has food banks wondering how they can keep inventories higher in the future\nWe will need to ask certainly looked for ways to on stage that we can continue serving families need\nBut for now groups like Dave Rich\nAnd United food bank our

I just always known as they go and watch these late night shows and it usually be you know straight white guys getting these opportunities and every once in a while I see a woman or every once in awhile I see like a black guy\nAnd I would just see it and I'll be like oh okay yeah all these people are fun and not take anything away from the people that did get those spots\nBut I'm like I'm surrounded by so many funny women so many funny people of color so many funny we're people who might not get those same opportunities to submit their tape to a book or to get green led to talk about different things from their perspective\nAnd so when Jackson I met we were just kind of like we know so many hilarious people\nWho don't have maybe the platform they they can to express themselves in a way we're like well it would be really do\nPun intended but it'd be really up to not only have a show that sort of ... showcases\nYou know my improv injustice improv abilities both singular and together but also uses shows a platform to just bring our friends along it'd be like we're supporting everybody this is a show for everybody if you are funny there's no reason why you're not going to be on the show and I think a lot of times you would just here you know\nAnd the industry oh they're just like our desert Ernie ... funny black women are we just don't know where to look and I'm like\nThat ... there are so many talented amazing people and if you're not plugging them it's either out of laziness or the fact that you really don't care\n[noise] so you're pretty successful now in comedy and with your podcast and HBO specials of to do queens but for years you made next to nothing as a comment yes yes and and you were getting like dining calls from the student loans that you owed you were nearly evicted from your apartment but you were given a reprieve\nOf like several weeks or a couple of months to raise the\nFive thousand dollars that you needed to stay in your apartment how did you handle the anxiety of not being able to pay your student loans and then not being able to afford to have an apartment and nearly ... ...\nYeah you know there are a lot of tears\nJust like not being able to sleep at night there's a lot of feeling like a failure of feeling like\nMaybe me trying to pursue comedy's a little nutty because I really didn't start making a really solid living doing comedy until eight and a half years and and um you know I was kind of like well maybe it shouldn't take this long\nThere are other people around me where it's like it's not taking them eight years to sort of like you know get their career going the way that they want to and you know looking back on and now I'm just kind of like you can't control when that happens\nI think yes it was kind of irritating that it took me this long but I think I was so fully ready for the opportunities that arose by that point so like you know to to queens being a HBO didn't scare me\nHaving to write a book didn't scare me it's like a cabin blogging in writing for three four years making what fifty bucks a blog post okay yeah I can just writing this book is going to be hard but I'm not going to run away from it [noise]\nLet me introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is comic an actor Phoebe Robinson who hosts the podcast and HBO specials too to queens with Jessica Williams and she has a new book which is called everything's trash but it's okay we're going to take a short break and then be right back this is fresh air\nAnd this is Kay Eugene McCarthy

comes from Seton apart of ascension snow central Texans can schedule care for themselves and their Family Online anytime without\nBreaking away from their day details on care and scheduling options can be found at gets eaten care dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is comedian and actor Phoebe Robbins and who hosts the podcast to do queens with Jessica Williams they closed it together and they often\nYou know I I just want to preface I most of my life is me not\nGetting us out like you know what I meant to be clear [laughter]\nI'm not really on on where guys are throwing themselves at me I'm Sorry I just think if you're on like knocking at that a lot and um\nI used to just be like I Will just wait for a guide asking yeah like I really was sort of in my ... my mom didn't teach me that sort of like to be a year but I was like I'm just going away for a guide to so that's truly\nHow I was dating and I would just wait for someone ask now and if no one asked me I just wouldn't day\nWhich is so ignorant and also like huh what's he talking about you got a job you could ask people out so you know that's just really where I was and so\nYou know I think interracial dating is just really tricky for a lot of people because I think a lot of times people want to find a reason for why you're not dating within your tribe and\nI'm always just kind of like you just meet who you me and if the timing is right like I met British bake off at a YouTube ... third L O L truly like hilarious because his band was over there for you to at the time and you know we\nSort of hit it off like not eat like not even right away I was like I don't care about the guns they focus on you do but like a vision I realized British bake off with that kind of dope and then we just ended up dating from nearby again\nThat was not it just wasn't pre planned I like didn't even like really\nGive him a second glance way I I met him so I mentioned that you and Jessica Williams hosts to Des Moines you have your own podcast I'm caught so many white guys and which you interview people as opposed to doing stand up\nAnd I interviewed you and I was really fun I really enjoy that a lot of us really glad I did\nThat um so how does somebody white guys get its name\nWell because you know most podcasts are hosted by white guys and then they interview other white guys and you're like cool [laughter] so you're going to have you're gonna have steak and eggs every day okay enjoy your life\nI'm inside just kind of wanting to be like I'm going to poke fun of like there's so many white guys but actually the thing is there's only one token white guy for seizing the rest of the episodes are just women where people people color and those who like the majority of the gas\n[noise] so now that you're I'm starting to be cast in roles um do you look at the casting calls or the equivalent and because um you write something very funny about that and and your first book but are there are kind of casting calls were you\nKnow that they are not there definitely like not entertaining idea of having a black person in that role like is there any kind of coded language that you can see when a black person would even conceivably be cast in the real\nThe lead [laughter] you're like oh so that leads gonna be ... cold [laughter] okay so I'm the best friend okay cool cool cool I got that you want me to sound like this okay\nI'm not going to do that but I think there were two big things that I said you know when I started acting like pretty recently I had to have a conversation with myself before I even like going to my agents or whatever\nAnd I was always like I Do want to think was part of a wife\nAsked rain a damn phone call from her husband and giving him some motivation I don't want to do that I don't want to be on the other line being like you got this baby I have no ... no life\nI'm just at home holding unfolded laundry I Will never you will never see I I hate to use the word never but you will never see me on screen holding a basket of unfolded laundry I Will not do\nIt if you were living alone and doing your own laundry that would be perfectly fine\nThat's okay but if I'm like on the phone with Chaney taint um and he's out you know freaking saving the president and I'm at home at stepping on a lego but Foley his you know gym shorts that's not the part for me\nUm you know I think the language in it or a casting call is like\nAll American is white beautiful but doesn't know it is white uh and then usually it will be like\nOpen to all ethnicities is when you know that that is oh that's a robot so that they can envision someone not white doing it but it's like all the rules should be open to ethnicity\nDo you know what I mean like there there is no reason why it took you know twenty some odd\nYears for that it'd be crazy Rich Asians there's no there's no excuse for that they could have been ... leads a romantic comedies this whole time and so whenever I see that stuff I always think about like ... and she's five as long as it's like not inappropriate in terms of language or sex is this the part that when she gets older\nWould I be embarrassed to show her that I did you know what I mean and so that's kind of always like sort of my needle and how I operate and\nIt's it's hard being in an industry where you know if you're not the mainstream sort of thing you're just not going to be considered but I think on the flip side what great right now is that\nThis is an industry where creators shine where they can swim where you can have like an Easter ray you could have you know a Phoebe adjusted could do to to queens you to have an ad in a lot of you can have all these sorts of people sort of just creating their own opportunities in their own lanes\nPhoebe Robinson it's just been great to have you on our show thank you so much\nTeri and honestly this has been a delight in my life and we got to hang out I Know we're supposed to see Bruno Mars together and we couldn't do it now because we're both working so [laughter] yes let me know none of the deaf leopard who had um had on that one [laughter]\nLet's go
