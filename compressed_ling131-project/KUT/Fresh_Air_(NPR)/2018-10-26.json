here the progression of the sun to American trade war earlier this year the United states for terrorists on solar panels and dishwashers from China and other countries to be sure and then it was steel and aluminum also China and other countries\nNow those thanks to the Trump administration's focus on Beijing is taxing fully half of everything that we buy from China all of that has led to retaliate George Harrison China and other countries on our exports agriculture mostly\nBowl thing happens so fast might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces got song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior in interaction which should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust\nBefore this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization and then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing begin requiring U.S companies their hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on Chinese\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust when it's broken into\nA trade war\nActually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how NYU business press I ruined sooner ... says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether Beijing responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and poses to address the US's best responses to see whether we're going to tax the all important as well if China doesn't them the best response to the U.S is also to say well you know they're not doing anything let me sort of collect from them\nNow if you think game theory is just a theory\nYou're taking on Nobel economist John Nash

in a way that\nHe came up with something called the national equilibrium which suggests that a trade war of self interest is actually the norm and that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing to address is the ... equilibrium of the game\nIs a neurosurgeon this means a trade war could go on a while as in ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust his Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nDo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd to provide political cover for DC is well

basketball and football teams the whole program became wildly successful and Louisville they started the costs sports the front porch of the university\nNow one of the parts of the story is the relationship between shoe end apparel companies and big time college basketball programs what's the relationship\nAdidas Nike and Under Armour a shooting apparel companies they fund the grassroots basketball circuit that's the circuit in which these players come from the Web of use teams are they fund all of that and then they pour a lot of money\nInto the college programs themselves you know a hundred and sixty million two hundred million dollars over a ten year period\nAnd that is in return for the players on the teams wearing their gear so if it's a Nike school and this is what they're called you're either a Nike school and Under Armour school or in a de to school so let's say you're a Nike school\nAnd you're basketball teams in the NC double a tournament where you've got the Nike swoosh on your sneakers that's on your trunks it's on your Jersey\nOr if you're aware a wrist bands it's it's on your wrist bands if you wear a head band it's on your head band\nSo what they get in return for this money is the right to turn players who are ostensibly amateurs into human billboards\nRight and the contracts are very detailed right the players have to wear only their gear and they give the university bonuses if they do well the shoe companies do\nWell if the teams do well if you're a Nike school and and you reached the final four or if you win the national championship your coach is sure to get a hundred thousand or a two hundred thousand dollar bonus\nOn top of his multimillion dollar salary the assistant coaches are probably going to get a bonus the school may get more money the only ones who don't benefit monetarily or the players\nBut ... does that bonus come from the shoe company or no I mean they they\nIt comes from the shoe company yes directly from the shoe company\nAnd these are really not big sums of money for the shoe companies you know Nike is a multibillion dollar global company so it was a deed is Under Armour a little less so but these are huge businesses\nAnd the money that that seems to to us perhaps so big\nIt's not that big for them and it also means they don't really have to advertise like they used to I mean if you've got temp players on the court and they're all running around in your insignia is why bother to advertise you know these are human action figures wearing your stuff for tens of millions of Americans to watch\nAnd it makes advertising a really redundant at that point and it's much cheaper way to do it\nBig time college basketball programs obviously want the best players so they're scouting and competition in recruiting them and I think most of us would figure this would focus on high school players you know juniors and seniors who who proved that they have the chops and they visit their families they do what whatever to try and get them interested in their program\nI learn from your book this starch much much earlier how young are players when they start getting attention\nFifth or sixth grade players are as young as\nTen or eleven years old when the basketball ... scouts start looking at them\nAnd saying are you a future college prospect are you a future NBA prospect and there are several reasons for this one of them is the size of players who make it to a big time college basketball in the NBA you know there's somewhere between six foot three\nAnd seven feet and up so that really narrows the population so if you're looking\nAt a young kid you're going to mostly look at a kid who's already begun already athletic and for that reason and some other reasons it is relatively easier in basketball to look at a sixth or seventh grader\nAnd correctly say this kid's going to be at least the college player so it becomes worse it for the scouts\nTo then prow the sidelines of\nFifth and sixth grade basketball tournaments\nOr their national publications or online sites that actually rate these players that have a lot of readers\nYes they are publications and scouting services that look at kids as young as fifth grade or one of them is called whose scoop it's run by a man named Clark Francis though I encountered several years ago and you know there are elements of Clark\nWhen you meet him that that you may not take him seriously he's a guy you know\nSpends his life looking at little basketball players the funny thing about him is if you go back and look at his towels sheets from five or six years ago and you look at the fifth and sixth graders who review rated the highest\nLotta them are in big time college basketball now or in the pros so he's certainly not write all the time\nBut he's not bad at at picking out the best players so what Clark Francis does whether you take them seriously or not is he lays down a foundation for people who then scout high school and middle school players\nAnd he sort of sets\nThe ... sort of\nNumber of players who may be looked at and the recruiting services are and other business another way that young grass roots or high school players generate income for other people\nNow they're not just watching these kids in school jams right there is something called the grassroots basketball network explain who runs that how it works\nWere being basically bribed to attend certain colleges um the money and many of the cases was to come from the shoe company that\nSponsored the college team they were going to and in this case Adidas although there was evidence in the trial that strongly indicated that Nike and Under Armour are engaged in the same kind of activity\nSo in the ... cases that will be tried\nThere are four assistant coaches at major programs charged and there were several\nOther figures on the grass roots circuit sort of sometimes called St runners or go betweens or consultants for the shoe companies they have also been charged and the question in each of these cases is\nWhere their federal crimes committed or where they're just violations of the NC double lays amateur ism rules which are not federal crimes\nRight so it seems clear from the evidence that there were relationships which seemed to violate recruiting rules and that money changed hands right\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that money changed hands by the way relatively small amounts of money in the grand scheme of what these apparel companies generate and and making profit\n[noise] this young man named Brian bow and junior who went by the nickname tubs a was a much sought after recruit ultimately signed\nUm with the University of Louisville which was poached by Rick Pitino just before the indictments and the events leading to his signing are among those involved in the criminal case what kind of money went to his family\nAre in front of them\nOne hundred thousand dollars was promised to Bryan bowing juniors father that would be Brian bone and senior of that one hundred thousand dollars only Nineteen thousand five hundred was ever delivered\nThe money was to have come from a deed is that Nineteen thousand five hundred dollars is one quarter of one percent\nOf the nearly eight million dollar annual salary than coach Rick Pitino was making so that to me is a pretty stark reminder of the inequity\nOf this whole youth basketball scene\nAnd and then there was evidence that that wasn't the first time that Brian bones dad had taken money based on his son's athletic ability\nIt was clearly not the first time that Brian bones senior had taken money he testified in court or under immunity from prosecution that he had taken money\nRepeatedly um four in return for his son playing for particular used teams or particular private high school in Indiana and there was a moment in court where\nThe defense attorney of Christian Dawkins one of the the runner these street agent said Brian bone senior on cross examination so you've been pimping out your namesake since she was fourteen years old\nAnd Brian bone senior only quibble about the age she paused for a second and then he said well maybe Fifteen or sixteen years old right\nAnd is there any evidence that Brian ... and the kid himself knew about this or saw any of the money\nRyan Bowen junior had told the FBI and he told me when I interviewed him and he has told everyone he did not know the money was exchanged that money was received by his father there's been no evidence that he didn't know he went from\nThe University of Louisville to the University of South Carolina he transferred last year the fact that the University of South Carolina\nTook him in is an indication that they certainly believed that that he had no knowledge of this but the NC double a still said you can't play basketball last year and then ruled that he could not play college basketball this year\nAnd Brian bone junior has gone off to play professionally in Australia\nA and is over there now in Sydney has become one of a thousand overseas player is\nTrying to attract the attention of NBA scouts he missed out on what is by far the easier route which is to play in college to be on TV to be known and just take that glide path right into the NBA\nSo Rick Pitino is the the coaches on the cover of the book um the book is kind of about this system of corruption and recruitment but Tina is a fascinating character\nUm you say it's not hard to make the case he's the best college basketball coach of his generation that tactical and motivational genius and to give us a sense an example of what he does that special\n\nRick Pitino one to national championships wanted Kentucky\nWon at Louisville you also coached the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks two of the marquee franchises and professional basketball in college basketball and particularly at Louisville he did something that's almost never done he won with out\nThe best players most final four teams most national champions are stocked with first round draft picks\nHi first round draft picks of the NBA which are called the lottery picks Rick Pitino one without those guys he coached\nGood players not great players he got them to play merciless defense they played so intense that he was a motivational and a tactical genius\nAnd you know by the way I Love watching him coach and he would stand on the sideline in in an athletic position with his knees bent\nAnd you know its head peering out over the court often one foot on the court\nAnd its hands behind him and I always got the feeling that he put his hands behind him because he was so intense that if they weren't there he would reach out and grab the ball as it came by but he was just this amazing coach and in some ways you know that for him to be caught up in this is\nA a predictable and and be tragic\n[noise] now he lost his job he was not charged in the criminal case but ah Louisville was tainted and he was given as walking papers after the indictment came out but you're right that this was not his first brush with scandal what were some of the others\nAre more than a decade ago Rick Pitino had a sexual ethic nation in a closed restaurant I'm with a woman who then tried to extort him [noise]\nAnd she was sent off to prison but he was the star prosecution witness who had to then recount in court\nThis incident with a woman who just met in a bank get everybody left the restaurant was terribly embarrassing and I would say after that\nPitino was just a basketball coach um which of course you always was but I I don't think he could be seen as a necessarily a mentor to young men\nThe second incident was in many ways more serious in Louisville it became known as stripper gate and what strip a gate was was four years of parties in the basketball dorm not very far from Tina's office sponsored by a local\nScored and paid for by a member of Pitino staff and women danced and there were sexual favors for recruits and for current players and in the ... in the NC\nDouble lays lexicon it's strange lexicon this was ruled to be permissible benefits to amateur players\nAnd Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over stripper gate so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike too and this recruiting scandal um and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involve Louisville\nLeave it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n[laughter] and then the strip for gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees are sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this in the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules sometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules\nThey don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so ... and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations\nWho were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino does not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says\nAnd right now coach Geno has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nYeah Jason cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's a terabytes is equivalent to about ... ...", "show_name": "Fresh Air
