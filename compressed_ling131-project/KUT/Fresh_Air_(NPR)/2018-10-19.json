but this month a New York times investigation based on thousands of confidential financial documents\nRevealed had Trump's father Fred set or transferring money to Donald using various schemes to avoid paying taxes starting when Donald with three\nYeah it it all up it was the seat credible stream of money when Donald Trump the millionaire actually was a time he was eight or nine years old\nToday David Barstow and Suzanne ... described their investigation into have Fred from transferring wealth from his real estate empire to Donald four hundred and Thirteen million measured in today's dollars and ten tanker reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas last\nOctober when a shooter opened fire on the audience [noise]\nFirst news\n[noise] that's exactly right he felt he was vehemently opposed to the idea that as he passed this fortune on to his family that he should pay any kind of tax whatsoever on the transfer of that wealth\nTo his children and he took all kinds of measures that we described in the story to avoid paying either gift taxes or later on um a state taxes because of this\nBelief that she just felt that what he had maybe she you know the government just didn't have a right to a single penny that\nYour investigation really like deconstruct that Donald Trump ness of the self made man who got like a one million dollar loan from his father and use that to build this enormous\nFor Ken and his real estate empire the actual story which she reports that when he was like three years old and starts getting like tens of thousands of dollars a year in today's dollars [noise]\nSo what was the process by which by age three he was getting hundreds of thousands of dollars on his father\nThat started in Nineteen forty nine and it was one of the projects that Tom ... got ... that Fred Trump had received government funding\nTo build it was um a complex called beach haven in what Fred Trump that it was quite ingenious as he bought the land underneath speech have and uh the complex that he would go on to build and he plays the land in a trust 'em for the benefit of his five children\nAnd then he started paying them read he makes his landlord and every year they continue to get payments so\nWait a second I don't really understand how three year old Donald Trump can be his father's landlord can you explain that\nSure it was his land to do what he wanted with and he put it in a trust in the sense when they were very young for their benefit and began pain them round it's completely legal um but that's sort of one of the ways in which he early on you know he's in his point it's in the Nineteen forties his children or young\nHe's looking for ways you would imagine at this point to begin to take care of his children as they get older so that they you know when they grow up they've got money\nAnd there's a way to transfer what is now he's becoming a very rich were mad as a one way to begin to transfer of wealth and now this is the first one it happened in Nineteen forty nine so what are some of the\nWay that by the time Donald Trump was a teenager he was already well what are some other ways his father gave him money [noise] he\nBegan doing a number of things so she started buying or building apartment complexes in Brooklyn and queens\nAnd then gradually transferring ownership of those apartment complexes to his children so for example Donald when he was Seventeen years old became co owner with his family members\nOf a fifty two unit apartment building in Brooklyn that his father had acquired for them and so they would overtime Fred\nTrump assembled a roughly eight apartment complexes over a thousand units and all that she transferred through a variety of mechanisms to his children and so those\nThousand units start churning out profits that flowed effortlessly into the pockets of his children we actually documented in our reporting two hundred and Ninety five different revenue streams that Fred Trump ultimately created for Donald Trump\nOver fifty year period for Trump was so ingenious at finding different ways of putting money into Donald Trump's pockets or he didn't just put him on his payroll is a salary employee\nHe also paid them separately to be a consultant to him she paid him separately to be\nA property manager for him he paid him separately\nTo be a purchasing agent for him on and on it would go [laughter]\nHe was getting laundry revenue from Trump and from the ... so you know some of these revenue streams were relatively modest some of them were kind of one hit wonders but when you add it all up it was this incredible stream of money that I mean Donald Trump\nUm he was a millionaire actually by the time he was eight or nine years old before he ever entered set foot into Manhattan where he would make his name uh for Trump it already transferred to him over nine million dollars in wealth\nHey by the time and he was twenty nine in Nineteen Seventy five Donald Trump had collected nearly nine million you probably have nine million dollars in today's dollars from his father when he was thirty and Nineteen Seventy six\n... really starts to expand their Nineteen Seventy six article in your newspaper the New York times and you describe it as one of the first major Donald Trump profiles and a cornerstone\nDecades have missed making about his well what are the article say what would you when the main points of this Nineteen Seventy six article that Donald Trump\n[noise] it was really one of the first big big profiles that ran a Donald Trump and Donald Trump did something in this particular profile but if you would actually a repeat and use to great effect in subsequent profiles which was [noise]\nShe took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he called his job is empire and he starts driving around New York pointing out this building in that building and talking about how wonderful they were doing and and effectively what he was doing was\nHe was appropriating his father's empire as if it were his own empire so these buildings that he's pointing out is his jobs with part of his empire there were in fact completely owned by his father\nHad known ships taken in any of those buildings and so what he what he did especially when it was critical to kind of the early ...\nAnd having lots of money meaning that he'd have to pay taxes on all of that and I think the taxes would have been fifty five percent and\nSo Donald Trump and his siblings came up with a plan that are involved and this is something that you discovered they come up with a plan that involves starting a company they caught all county building supply and maintenance this was in Nineteen Ninety to sit down would you describe how this company function\nSure this was an interesting moment because when you think of ... you think of all the buildings that he only owned\nNumerous buildings in Queens and Brooklyn where hundreds of millions of dollars for a Trump was also somebody who hated\nDebt and so he had very little doubt on these buildings and the documents that we found when we were sort of going through them we saw he had just mountains of cash tens of millions of dollars of cash were throwing flowing through his personal bank accounts and the bank accounts of the buildings\nAnd this created a huge problem for the siblings because if he died he would be facing a fifty five percent\nOr state talks so they created\nA company in the early Nineteen nineties called all county building supply in maintenance and it was a company the shareholders for Donald Trump and his siblings and a\nNephew of fraud Trump and what this company did was for years for Trump's buildings would go out and they would buy supplies you'd see for everything from ... to ... to supplies if they needed a new roof to windows all this stuff would be bought\n'em by the buildings and they would go to like Long Island\nWholesalers or a Home Depot and they would get what they needed um and for a Trump buildings would pay for that\nAnd then one day all county the company that does Donald Trump and his sibling owns they would go out and Paul county would pay for the material\nThe differences is if they paid five hundred dollars for a fridge stove combo\nThey would then send a separate invoices padded invoice up to ... Trump and the building that he owned\nAnd they would mark it up to seven hundred dollars and the shareholders of all county Donald Trump and his siblings would pocket the difference this went on for years on item after item after item and they were successfully able to drain tens of millions of dollars from Fred Trump's buildings this way\nSo the sole purpose as far as you can tell this company that the Trump children created\nWas to inflate the prices of things like boy ... refrigerators and um other like things that are um buildings need\nSo that they buy them inflate the price salad to Fred Trump for his real estate empire pocket the difference so that they make hundreds of dollars every time they sell something to Fred Trump\nAnd that was a way of like transferring money from ... to the siblings\nYou know and as we started out on the recording us I'm at one of the questions I'm immediately we knew Fred Trump drove a hard deal he was very careful with this money I'm an every penny was you know you could see it you would account for he was a guy who would walk construction sites and if he saw an nail on the ground he would pick it up and make sure it was used somewhere\nSo we found it hard to believe that he wasn't already driving a pretty hard to deal with the with the dealers and the the the sellers that he had to\nTo do business with every day from the buildings but we went out and when we looked for um possible employees that all county had maybe they had a purchasing department that was actually getting better deals\nWe through our interviews and the documents um that we had we couldn't find any any even employees that all county had it was simply a mechanism where\nIt would mark up the material and then bill ... it was a and basically an invoice ... operation where they were just overcharge Fred on these items that it served no other purpose\nWhen the Trump sibling set up a county this this company that just that existed to siphon money from friends from and give it to the children did Trump know about the company but the purpose of the company was he unknowing\nPart of its creation [noise]\nWe think that he absolutely was he was in the strategy meetings where they came up with these ideas\nAnd appeal to him because it was um she was someone who just hated the idea of paying any kind of gift or a state taxes and we also see his signature on checks um that were written to all county building supplies so he was a man who\nPaid close attention to every probably those are those that there's evidence both in the reporting in the documents\nThat she was absolutely um this was something that he was all on board with\nAnd then in a way like the collateral victims of these inflated cost where rent or isn't a lot of Trump properties because he use those inflated cost for boilers and refrigerators themselves\nAs a way to justify raising the rent on people living in government rent control units\nThat is right when you're an owner of a building and you have rent controlled apartments you have people living in them you have to apply to the city or the state\nTo have the rent increased and you have to send over proof when you do that that you've made various improvements in this case they use the potted receipts in many instances the false receipts to say that we made repairs worth you know a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand when in fact\nThose repairs may have only costs eighty thousand they use these bogus receipts that they had created to justify higher than what should've been rent increases and then the depositions that we have them we obtain journal reporting Robert Trump Donald Trump's brother talks about this and he says the higher the mark up the higher the rent we could charge\nAfter friend the parents died in June Nineteen Ninety nine at age in Ninety three\nYou say the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his state and that that was a testament to the success of the tax strategies to transfer money to the Trump children\nBut you're right the single largest item included infrared Trump's estate tax return was it ten points three million dollar I argue from Donald Trump money Donald Trump appeared to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died we've heard stories about Donald Trump's debt to banks\nAnd this is the first time hearing that he owned his father millions of dollars on his father died\n[noise] well he owed his father or mother for most of his life um and there were repeated\nStrategies through the years to do something about those unpaid that's that would accumulate so for example in the late Nineteen eighties at this point Donald Trump or his father somewhere in the neighborhood Fifteen million bucks\nAnd the problem is that if his father simply cancelled that that\nWell in the eyes of the ...\nOr cancel dollar debt is the same as a dollar of income so Fred Trump is simply chancellor but that said I forgive you you don't have to pay me back Donald Trump was owed a chunk of\nTax for what's called cancellation of debt so Donald Trump and Fred from came up with this other way of making\nThat debt completely disappear involved\nTrading the debt for stage in one of Donald Trump's buildings so Fifteen million dollars or so of that for\nA steak in a building called Trump Palace in then and then a few years later\nFred Trump soul that Fifteen million dollar steak back to his son for ten thousand dollars proof there goes that huge debt\nMy guest or New York times reporter says and crack and
