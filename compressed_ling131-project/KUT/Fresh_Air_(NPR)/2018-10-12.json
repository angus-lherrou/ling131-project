real like exercise is for them to have it\nBe so publicly that clock turned that has been extremely upset it\n[noise] so um there's been two times when the Judiciary Committee and then all of Congress have had to vote about whether\nThe woman who accused the man of federal harassment or assault was lying or telling the truth\nAnd if there's enough evidence to prevent\nThe Supreme Court nominee from becoming confirmed so there isn't the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas cage and other lousy for Brett Kavanaugh case and in both cases judiciary and Congress voted for the men and against the woman making the accusations\nLet's look at how colleges handled accusations you write about how colleges have developed their own system of helping to bring some kind of justice\nWhen accusations when women come forward to accuse I'm a fellow student of sexual assault or rape and they're not quartz per se but they are some forms of proceedings\nCan you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it like what their procedures are\nWell all colleges have to be doing it it's the rule you got to have a title nine office and the title nine of us have to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or\nGroping or violent rape very seriously and they have them since two thousand eleven one Obama kind of lay down the law and said\nI Want all of you to um pursue this I Want girls to have an equal access to education and they can't if they're you know dealing with trauma from a sexual assault and that's totally trailing great um\nSince then as many people know universities have had a hard time putting these courts together Obama's guidance was good but it's almost didn't hold them enough about what they should do\nYou know what do the records look like who should sit on the court he did say that he'd like everybody to use a\nStandard of the preponderance of the evidence so it's more likely than not that the act occurred um it's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate\nHere although many attorneys do not agree with that um so what do they what are these proceedings alone [noise]\nDid they bring people in who will support their point of view\nIs there an investigation hundreds or ... you know the number one thing to understand is that across the country all of these courts are different and they're different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the bonds to take it seriously\nI'm so real investigations are happening for short now universities don't have subpoena power so whichever students are going to talk to them\nThey'll send a letter to the accused and say you're being brought up on this they'll say okay well we're going to probably have a case in a couple of months so get everything ready and\nYou know there's no real system to help the accused him a lot of cases and the boys\nRarely author parents right there on their own they're at school they're afraid they ask somebody's you know older brother sets them up with some attorney or may or may not have an idea of how to actually help this boy then there'll be some sort of proceeding and\nYou might have a fisheries professor who is the person who's going to judge or case where you might have actually a a former prosecutor it's completely random who is going to decide your fate\nPart of the reason why these college systems have developed to deal with charges of sexual assault as President Obama sent out\nBasically a a letter of guidance right it was it wasn't a law but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault and this was built on\nTitle nine and so explain what title nine is which was passed as a small part of a of a larger piece of legislation and signed by President Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSo title nine is just a short law that nobody in a university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender and I knew it in the nineties as a law that would protect Women's Sports which of course it doesn't and this argument about whether\nTitle nine should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years\nPresident Trump's secretary of education Betsy divorce is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus and tell us about the changes that she's making or is on the verge of making that he had to focus has been very\nConcerned about the due process in a campus courts\nShe has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys so she is quite concerned about the accused student and things that you know I mean you just had to her deputy set it to the New York\nWell I think that the at the time that Kavanaugh was there it was actually a pretty cool thing to be part of um it was a repository of future power and people like the ones you just described were in it but nobody who wasn't in deep cared about to eat\nBut over the years since the eighties\nUm ... the ... very popular on American campuses you know millennials they like to join things\nI'm your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward getting a job being ... that to me being really help you um you know we've seen students really joined up with the Greek system\nSo the famous story was deep is the story and early two thousand tens\nWhere it groups pledges were marching across campus and went to the women's center where upon they chanted no means yes yes means anal um and some of the students who are uh yell at the time\nReally thought that this was the straw that broke the camel's back for them in terms of the weight girls were being treated on the campus and\nThey ended up filing title nine complaint with office for civil rights about yell and particularly the\nUm and it was the first one that was filed during this kind of two thousand eleven Obama time when Obama said yes students tell us what's happening we want to hear from you what's going on on campuses so it was a very important part of that history\nWhat are some of the ways colleges college administrators are trying to deal with fraternities and with the binge drinking at fraternity\nParties there are some universities who had moved pledging either in January or they've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just\nMadness right now you have kids pledging fraud and who knows what kind of bears are going to be told to tape and they're going to be getting wasted every night as are hazed I mean this is just\nHideous um so I think there are um some frogs that are are trying to bring in um courses about sexual assault trying to be more enlightened about it uh I returned inexpensively [noise]\nSure there are some fraternities are doing that yeah definitely um I read excessively about Wesleyan where I went to school which is not exactly known as a fried haven but there were a bunch of ... there and while I was reporting the book um they wetland decided to shut the all of those ... [noise]\nSo you know I didn't know that until I read your book but I'm sororities are um by the Greeks code or or whatever it is sorority if aren't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties only fraternities\nCan do that and that's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it's the men on campus who are going to control the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at\nParties Oh absolutely I mean this is the key issues that universities\nHave boys still really dominate the social scene on college campuses not only are one in six American boys who go to a four year colleges are in profits at home\nWhich is a population that's up by half in the last decade guys get the kegs right guys by the drugs\nYou can't even have parties at sorority in America that's the ... rules so the guys get to have the parties at their houses and they set the rules and they set the costume theme and the theme is always something like Little Mermaid\nFor the girls to come really scantily closed so I was just kind of shocked that the animal house eat those which we used to think was\nJust a small sliver\nOf the American college experience and almost a joke has really spread out across America where you can just do whatever you want to do\nAnd then when it's over it's all ... and it's just that crazy thing you did in college who know actually because there's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences you know some woman\nAre saying now ... what we really need to do in order to like stop or at least diminished the amount of sexual assault on campus is just stop rape culture\nWhat is meant by that\nSo rape culture um is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between in American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault so\nYou know this rape culture is a culture where their rate mess that wasn't outfit or alcohol consumption has caused her weight and nobody questions these attitudes that box and the victim like nobody says\nIt doesn't matter that you were dressed a certain way or it doesn't matter how much you drank\nThey say well victims are kind of a week and they can lie and maybe they're just crazy or maybe they're gold diggers there's all these reasons why a woman would make up the story maybe she's just trying to lie so she didn't get in trouble with her boyfriend et cetera\nSo what we really see about rung this young generation is we use all to participate in that culture and also very differently than than the nineties when I was in college back then of course she talked about sexual assault lot in the early nineties during you know that PC era\nBut what we were taught us carry me\nGo to a self defense class right protect yourself\nBecause boys will be boys and the best you can do is make sure that your say on your own now these girls are saying no it's not our problem it's your problem right and there are signs will say things like don't get raped and then they'll\nCross out some of the word so let's do rape no it's boys who have to change its feet into ... that have to change this is about institutional accountability [noise]\nAbout the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism and I'll use beyond say as an example here I mean she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women in so many men and women just\nI mean a door her understandably\nAt the same time in so many of her concerts over the years she's she's dressed in very sexual allies clothing and a lot of the clothing it's and it's just to have a lot of women like pop stars and he'll pop stars\nUm it's it's very sexual lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise] um so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see in another way I'm offering myself to you as an object as a sexual I as somebody\nI Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly ... sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on the most sexual parts of my body mhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation\nAnd I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about that or ... up a lot when talking to young women on campus as\nWell it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is this empowering or is this denigrating on\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I in my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self objective vacation isn't that just a\nA reasons isn't that just some we're justifying\nOn this kind of way that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up in these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now\nKnow Brittany spears was like if they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion that is much much can't here than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same idea about oh if I trust the sweet makes me look like a lot because this is the way people dress now there is such a casual way and you're right in a lot of concerts of of being let's say or\nKaty Perry re on a you know it's it's crossing a line way from scanty to something extremely sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed is dies from like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good to me that they were presenting themselves", "year": "2018",
