R. T. Russian propaganda network\nA so he already had troubling connections to the Kremlin and and when it was revealed that he had had conversations with the Russian ambassador\nCommensurate right around the same time that the Obama administration was announcing sanctions against Russia I mean it just raised obvious questions what was Flynn telling these people\nSo how did you find out what he was telling them how do you do that\n[laughter] [noise] we were digging it that for quite a long time not getting I'm not making a whole lot of progress\nUm I had gone to a an event or Kislyak was speaking even and ah he was speaking he's a physicist by training of all things\nAnd he was speaking at a conference in Washington and I showed up and sat down next to sit down next to him and started pepper him with questions and he started answering a and sort of caught me off guard he wouldn't tell me what he talked about ... but he\nUh admitted that he'd had long standing relationship with Flynn and had many conversations with him\nThe thing that I think one thing that changed the dynamic was a column\nUm that David Ignatius a columnist for the Washington Post wrote\nThat just posed these questions we know that Mike Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador we know what when those occurred\nWe deserve answers from this new administration about what was said and that puts the white that put the White House under some pressure and it was their answers and they're misleading and dishonest answers that then unleashed the sourcing that we needed to get to the bottom of it did decide to come to you\nWill see what happens is after after that Ignatius column you have incoming White House officials including Sean Spicer\nAnd vice president Pence going on television and saying we've talked to Mike Flynn sanctions were not discussed in those conversations absolutely not nothing to it\nThat's when I'm longstanding sources for reporters at the post started here started to tell us not true not true you guys need to look into this that's not true\nAnd it was you know I'm through the reporting of my colleagues adamant is Ellen knock ashamed of\nMyself and trying to get out that no we alternately got nine sources I'm telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with Chris Rock and in fact it signaled\nThat they could expect some relief from those sanctions when Trump was an office\nSo you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues at him and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with the source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations with sources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source\nAnd he's going through that list of\nThe facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source\nThat the White House position on this is false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further they're not honest and that's what sets in motion the sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it [noise]\nSee your your team contacts Flynn to say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador\nAbout lifting sanctions after Trump takes office and then of course denied it and denied it and denied it and then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision may\nWas a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter I'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public\nAnd there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have everything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague Karen DeYoung who had a previously scheduled interview with Flynn\nIn his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raised this question with him one last time to tell them look post is close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen\nSo caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this and we actually hit pause in the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the sort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom\nThe next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Cameron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I think I ever use the word number nine I laid I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described that sourcing to those editors and came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to\nTo nail this down I'm Marty Baron and others were\nWere didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with this story\nWe need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing so that's that's an option\nYou've talked about how Devin Nunes as the chair of the house intelligence committee\nThrough sand in your face by basically denying maybe lying about any connections between the Trump Administration and Russia and Russian interference in the election the question comes up why didn't we know more\nAbout Russian interference before the election 'cause the Obama administration knew about it the intelligence agencies and went on to what was happening and the intelligence agencies\nStrongly felt that Russia intended not just a mess with that but to discredit Hillary Clinton [noise] there was a lot of Republican\nOpposition to making any of this public and a lot of that opposition came from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell can you describe the ways he tried to prevent anything from going public about Russian interference\nThere is a long gap between when the U.S government through its intelligence services learns what Russia's doing\nAnd when the public finally learned about it a and there's a lot of second guessing even now about why the Obama administration didn't tell the public more or earlier there are scenes in the book I write about in late August or the early August timeframe late July timeframe\nJohn Brennan who was CIA director at the time becoming increasingly concerned about what was happening the WikiLeaks dump it already occurred\nHe sort of holes himself up inside his office at CIA headquarters on the seventh floor for two straight days deep into the night each day poring over all of the agencies Russian intelligence at the end of this exercise he's just convinced that Russia\nAnd he has any sitting on a new intelligence in fact that tells him\nThat the Kremlin is playing a bigger game here than anybody has to that point realized that they're not just in it to try to disrupt the election but they are trying to help elect Trump and damage Hillary Clinton\nAnd he calls the White House that week calls him in early August I Need to get in to see the president after his meeting with Obama the game plan involves brand and then trying to reach out to congressional leadership this is sort of an all hands on deck moment for the U.S government\nThey want to make sure the leadership in Congress is aware of what's happening in the election so Brennan starts calling\nYou know the Senate and house leadership to committed the leadership of the committee the relevant committees and so forth and setting up one on one briefings with these people and uh that's really unusual for CIA director to do\nAnd he finds you know that the Democrats are lining up at his door that to to me and learn about what's happening Republicans are putting them off\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans intel almost a month later sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless this is a you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this in the book\nAnd burning feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and trying to install Donald Trump\nAnd he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell\nBecause McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by McConnell is saying well if you basically tells them if you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump\nI Will consider that interference in the election and I will\nI Will call the administration out on that I Will accuse the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader being told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to\nIssue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering the election\n[noise] you you right who had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would uh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia is trying to tilt the outcome of this election the Obama team felt sort of\nHandcuffed I'm now ... you could argue that they that they really weren't and that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that when newness and McConnell and others refused to go along\nThey're sort of stuck they can't see a way past that it takes some months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose\n[noise] you know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference in this was in late September\nUm was a letter to state election officials from off for leaders of Congress warning of unnamed quote malefactor is that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd an urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia so\nEven when McConnell given I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mention of of Russia itself veil it's\nAstonishing to look packets astonishing you look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um\nSo so meanwhile John Brennan who's trying to convince McConnell luck Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell are saying Oh yes you say that public am going to say you're interfering in the election so brand and recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um I don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew that Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it and then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening\nIs that treason is that like legally treason\nDon't want to use words like treason [noise] um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um the tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time um where political imperatives\nWhere loyalty to party or party considerations seemed to overwhelm everything else including the ... concern for the country and its in its core institutions\nI mean what's more Coors than an election an American election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection\nUm and putting above all party considerations than that\nAnd yet we seen numerous cases through this period in which um when senior officials learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell is one of them their impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of Trump's victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's\nIt's um it's a troubling thing\nAnd all the way it wasn't always this way\n[noise] I mean we introduced you here if you're just joining us my guess is Glenn Miller he
