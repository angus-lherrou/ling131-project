blockbusters I'm ...\nI'm an Jacobs for marketplace\nFarming is a tough way to make a living no matter their crop there's always the weather to deal with never mind hurricanes and the southeast this time of year Florence and Michael did a whole lot of damage past couple of months\nNow though consider the crop but also trade policy and you'll discover the tobacco farmers in North Carolina or in a gym fewer people in the United states are smoking of course and most of the tobacco crop is marketed overseas especially China\nBut because this is the way trade wars works China has put American tobacco products on its tariffs lists\nMarketplaces into your has that story\nTripled the farms covers about eight hundred acres in Johnson county North Carolina about forty five miles southeast of Raleigh\nRate in Baton is one of the owners he's thirty two and runs the form of his dad and his uncle they farmed corn and wheat and soy beans but he says their cash crop is tobacco and right now he's stuck without a whole lot of farming to do\nNormally around the middle to the end of October we would be wrapping up harvest but unfortunately that that was a bit early this year the tobacco that we had in the field was destroyed and forest came through\nBatten says jumped in county got about Eighteen Inches of rain in three days and the roots were washed out tobacco leaves are harvested annually three or four times a year and the last harvest in October renders the highest quality tobacco for baton that harvest pays the bills\nFlorence guaranteed he'll be out that money but he says sales were already down because of President Trump's trade war with China\nLast year in North Carolina exporting more than a hundred and fifty million dollars in leaf tobacco to China making China's largest consumer of the state tobacco in the world in April the Chinese raise the tariff on American tobacco from ten percent to thirty five\nNinety percent of what we grow as for export and not only this year we face and possibly reduce sales and reduce market process because of the Chinese terrorists were also looking at potential contract cuts for next year\nBecause of this year's crop can't be sold it'll remain on the shelf until it's gone and bad and says he'll be unlikely to find a contract with cigarette companies for next year's crop if that's the case Larry ... is the president of the north Carolina Farm Bureau\nChina's our largest export was our largest export customer for tobacco they're more smokers in China now we've got population here in the United states\nChina makes up a third of all cigarette consumption of the world these days and it's domestic smoking continue to dwindle tobacco farmers in North Carolina have to look to international markets to fill the gap wouldn't says he doesn't think the Trump Administration knows what these terrorists are doing to tobacco farmers\nTobacco was easy targets doesn't have many friends in Washington but for our former shooting North Carolina it was devastating\nGranted baton is the sixth generation and his family to farm says it than his blood but he's got a young son twins on the way so he's struggling to decide whether farming is still a viable way of life\nI didn't want a foreign because I Love it I have a passion for it but at the end of the day I Can't do it for three because I have to support my family too and I think there's definitely a struggle when something is always on my mind\nHe says if he does keep farming he'll consider changing what he plans to better reflect market shifts\nTobacco is our cash crop but you know way of talking about other things he is obviously on the horizon you know with the new farm bill it could become technically legalize so that you could grow yet I think that's an exciting new potential market\nBut changing what you farm isn't something folks in North Carolina can do immediately Tom ... says some politicians understand that he's a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations at a former U.S trade negotiator\nWhat's hard about this current trading environment of course is that China is a big market for North Carolina farmers and this change has come suddenly for them\nAnd the effects of the trade war likely won't disappear as abruptly as they've emerged says Colin Carter he's a professor of agriculture and resource economics at the University of California Davis if\nThe U.S annoys China and China responds that will not come back overnight\nBecause he says China can go elsewhere for its tobacco like Brazil Zimbabwe or Argentina I

which voting rights were expanded for millions of people\nToday we talk with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot and senior reporter for Mother Jones about how the upcoming keen mid term elections could be affected by voting restriction\nThrough voter ID laws through proof of citizenship lost to register by purging the voting rolls by cutting early voting and by closing polling places\nAnd we'll talk about Kansas in Georgia where the secretary of state who oversees the election is also the Republican gubernatorial candidate\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest because secretaries of state or the top election officials in their states and so they decide how voting laws in their states or design and implemented that's coming up on fresh air\nI think that a number of different things Georgia has done has earned a state that moniker but more recently this issue exploded because the news emerged it was reported by the Associated Press that Brian Kemp office the secretary of state's office in Georgia\nWas blocking fifty three thousand voter registrations in that state Seventy percent from African Americans eighty percent from people of color what was happening as people were submitting voter registration applications and if it didn't exactly match if their names on the voter registration forms didn't exactly match\nOther state databases these voters were sent a letter telling them that their applications were pending and they needed to provide more information to election officials and this was very confusing to people because even though these pending voters could show up\nAnd vote at the polls with the correct id they couldn't vote by mail but they could vote at the polls\nIf you've got a letter in the military that said there was a problem with your registration\nYou probably would think that you weren't eligible to vote so they set off widespread confusion the fact that Brian ... secretary of state was running for office at the same time his office was doing this and that he was running against Stacey Abrams who could be the first black woman governor in us history\nThat really made this a huge national story\nAnd Stacey Abrams is actually a voting rights activists\nStacey Abrams is the voting rights activists and the big picture in this race is that these two candidates have a very different view of voting rights in this country Stacey Abrams a Democrat is running to become\nThe first black woman governor and us history she needs very high black voter turnout and in fact she has made it her goal to register a lot of new black voter she started a group and twenty Thirteen called the New Georgia project\nThat had the intent and purpose of registering more black voters\nBrian cap on the other hand the Republican is very reliant on support from white voters in Georgia and so his view of the electorate and his view of voting rights is that it's necessary to restrict access to the ballot and in fact the people that are most affected\nBy his policies are the kind of people that are going to be most likely to vote for states to a room so there's there's a clash between their two ideologies\nThese two figures have clashed themselves because when Stacey Abrams founded this group called the New Georgia project\nAnd twenty fourteen they submitted eighty five thousand voter registration applicants to ... office and camp to blocked about half of those registrations from going through and he claimed that there was fraud going on within Abrams group the New Georgia project\nUltimately there were no fraud charges that were filed against the group\nHowever this battle between these two people Brian Kevin Stacey Abrams dates back a few election cycles so when I saw that they were running against each other I knew that voting rights was going to be a major issue in this race although I don't think anyone quite saw that the issue was going to blow up quite as much as it did\nYou know the exact match room where your voter registration has to exactly match your voter id\nUnderstand how hard that can be I mean I have a passport and your driver's license and\nOne has the middle of the national and one has a middle name\nAnd and trying to change the passport and there's so much I tried and failed I really tried and so I still have to work on that it's not fast and it's confusing which for him to use which office to go to I got wrong advice so it's not simple to change that kind of\nReally minor discrepancy\nIf it makes you feel any better you're not alone Terry there in Wisconsin was thinking about adopting a similar exact match system\nThe six retired judges who help oversee elections there they ran this past and four out of the six judges in Wisconsin failed the exact match system because their names on their voter registration forms were different than their names in state databases and so\nThis kind of exact match system is known as disenfranchisement by typo\nBecause when you submit a voter registration form if you have\nA hyphen missing on your name if you have an apostrophe missing if you use palm on one form and Thomas on another your former is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia\nAnd what's interesting to me is that Georgia first tried to put this policy in place in two thousand nine when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the voting rights act\nAnd the federal government actually blocked this exact match system from going into effect\nBecause they said it was discriminatory against minority voters who are more likely to be flagged by this system then when Brian Kemp was elected in twenty ten he started doing this administratively he was sued and twenty sixteen by the lawyers committee for civil rights of voting rights group because thirty five thousand\nRegistrations were flagged is pending under the exact match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flat\nAnd ... office after said he was going to stop doing this system but what happened is the Georgia legislature basically reauthorize the law gave voters more time to do this and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was backed into effect they thought and I was one of those people that thought\nThis was Boston twenty sixteen how is Brian Kemp doing this again and that's only when I realized that the Georgia legislature had reauthorized this long given ... new powers that a federal lawsuit was meant to prevent\nWhy are people of color more impacted by this exact match law than a white people are\nThat's a very good question and that was a question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that basically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers\nSo they might have names that don't match\nOn the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually
