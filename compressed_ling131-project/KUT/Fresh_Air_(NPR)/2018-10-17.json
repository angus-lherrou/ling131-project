memoir for young adults hate kiddo how I lost my mother my father and dealt with family addiction his mother started doing drugs like she was Thirteen his new book is nominated for a National Book award\nAnd assigning for one of his earlier books his wife overheard a woman telling a friend\nI was his mother's parole officer and I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying loan and credit line so no one else and\nThat's an example of why Chris asked his grandparents assumed legal custody when he was about to turn three welcome to being the child of an addict that's coming up on fresh air\nFirst news\nThat I grew up in to pursue my dream Soviet our college uh so it seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from that Seventeen year old self\nThe story is told to their perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book\nBut really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches so so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it\nSeems so I don't need to have a bad mother that you felt were to let setting to put in a book for young people\n[noise] I've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and every time I Would sit down to write it\nI Would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well my people kind of thing and at first it was what are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um\nAnd I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and it's camping it's funny and\nI thought wow is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line\nUm ... as I've traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realized that this was sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean\nYou know to go with the theme of comic books with with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have this audience of these kids who grew up with my books I'm able to deliver the story and a very unique way\nAnd I and I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and\nI realize that if I if I was going to write a memoir had just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and all of a censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an ass\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft or care about the readers but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother and uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain\nHow really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult and I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protectionist\nAnd when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they murdered somebody and uh my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's the big reason why she went away\nThat time how much you're heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of you know what let me just mentally shelf that\nWe can focus on being a dad did this human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee have to explain to the readers fully why she's going away for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall\nOr or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the outlaw how to Terry and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of him 'cause they were afraid you'd become a word of the state that's exactly it\nThat's exactly it and they were and they also afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon ... and ... has been the sort of the forbidden fruit in our house um she really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained to her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published so a classmate didn't come in and say oh I I notice about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\nWow ... one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with your grandparents you were shot that they made breakfast free because even before you were three when you were living with your mother and you'd wake up to an empty house and have to make your own breakfast\nThat's true and uh I remember them telling me this and you know again sometimes things in it as an adult come at you and you learn about these different aspects of your your youth and this is an in the book because again this is something that um I Would have learned later\nI'm after my grandparents passed I created an art scholarship and their name but the Worcester art museum where I attended classes and to sort of kick start the scholarship and let people know this was happening I had an exhibit at the ... museum and it was also coincided with my ten year anniversary of getting published\nAnd a woman came through the line with her children and be excited they got their book signed and after they got their books I'm they you know a couple of steps away and they were chatting with their friends or they didn't realize they were within earshot at my wife Gina\nAnd this woman said you know the last time I saw him he was a baby and I was his mother's parole officer and I went on the house to do a wellness check and he was a baby crying alone in his crib\nHouse I probably was in kindergarten and and I and I say that just based on the fact that I remember being super obsessed with smart so I have photos of us visiting her at Christmas Time and and I was getting opening ...\nAnd stuff and and also based on my teeth I mean I'm really looking back at my family photos and then looking at my children and where they are with losing and getting to the tie to try to pin down certain dates on how old I was at certain moments so\nYou know I came to live with my grandparents are just before my third birthday which was at Christmas Time they gain legal custody of me within the next year and so there are probably a couple of years where I just had zero contact with or is it very young child what\nWas your understanding when you visited her at the halfway house was it was a halfway house or are we have recently\nI I Believe it was a half of his place she didn't live there's a spectrum house and it was under and what's interesting is some of\nI just had a release party in a book signing for a kid when my home town of western some old counsellors actually attended and identify themselves to me so I was able to thank them for taking care of her back then\nUm [noise] I Wonder what did you learn about her from them it was it was very very brief interaction um you know I'm hoping to circle back in and get in touch with them if they can share what they can share with me but um\nI just remember how thrilled and excited I was to see her\nAnd and how devastated I was just separate from her knowing that she wasn't coming home with us and knowing that I had no idea when I Would see her next [noise]\nWhere are you afraid that you'd be using ... your mother did and because she a grant grandparents drank a lot like how did that affect you and when you\nGot old enough to consider alcohol or drugs\nYeah I\nI you know I always feared that I Would fall into that those those same stuff so I was always very prudish about\nYou know having having a drink or anything like that and um [noise]\nI I knew addiction within the family I knew it was hereditary\nAnd I I knew that it was dangerous territory to to dabbling thing so uh you know come college member my freshman year of college and I I was at University of Hartford I wasn't that round schooling design just yet I remember that you suddenly given this freedom when you're drinking all the time\nAnd I remember sort of hitting a wall of like whoa like I'm I'm drinking almost every single day this is unhealthy this isn't\nGood I Need to get out of the situation um because I don't want to fall into that same traps of the uh my my both my birth parents had stuff and addictions and their addictions on both sides so ah so I was always very wary and very careful of that and um you know so ... ... because of\nMy mother I mean um my mother was a very talented artist and when she was incarcerated or we she would send me letters and she would draw cartoons for me and a big part of how we communicated for many years was um was through art so\nShe would draw face you would drive me Snoopy and then she would request I maybe I draw her the path or something I Would draw her the pink panther and and I would write back and request Garfield\nAnd I remember as a very young person seeing how talented she was\nBut she had such squandered that talent or because of because of the drugs and and that really was my driving force to to want to get published you know I was I was meeting both proposals to publishers when I was a junior in college\nSo I'm the first cartoon that you had published is when you were a freshman VOA love the story\nSchool [laughter] and the school newspaper was having a theme for prom so it was like a prompt theme and you submitted a prom cartoon that was published in the local lister newspaper the telegram and cause that\nThis was an editorial cartoon contest that was all across the city for high school students than Mr ...\nWas so brave to submit this you know who taught at holy name central Catholic high school this comic of mine a was chosen to be printed in the in the city paper so such or when you go you read the first line I'll read the second kid line\nHey man you got any protection\nWhat kind guns knives or condoms\nYeah that is so great and you can look amazing that they published that fewer high school freshman so was that was the local paper that was the first place to publish any of your work is that the same paper in which your grandparents\nRead that your mother had oh deed and was found face down on the sidewalk that's the same newspaper yeah I mean it was she survived the city but um it was I'm sure horrifying for the family to read about this in the newspaper they they probably didn't know before they read about it right\nThey did and that wasn't the first time they they learn news about Leslie in the newspaper I mean that's something that happened quite frequently and that's something that happened to me and my adult life for for the last few years of her life really the only way I can keep track of her was to go to the west or telegrams of Web sites and type in ... into the search field and find the latest court records\nWow if you're

'cause ask a and he's the author of picture books and he's the author of graphic novels for young readers his new graphic memoir is for kids a little bit older like what age would you say\nThis book as young adults so that would be twelve in up um but they were they're difficult truths in this book but there are young people dealing with some difficult truths as well so right\nAnd it's called ... how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction we'll be right back after this break this is fresh air\nAnd this is key you T Ninety point five thanks for tuning in\nSupport comes from the law a local personal injury from dedicated to simplicity transparency inclined education more about why understanding legal options can dramatically changed the outcome of a case that definitely yes\nDot law [noise] support comes from duty technology commercialization program a one year masters at ... school of business alternating weekends on campus or online in ... in October twenty third registration at Texas M.
