Kurdish a contributing editor at Rolling Stone magazine and now the author of a new biography of Lou Reed\nI Want to ask you about a period of ... and a lot of people have spoken about I think he chose not to speak about it publicly and I'm Talking about the period where he had electroshock therapy electric ... therapy and this is when he was in college and I always heard that this was because his\nParents were afraid that he was gay what did you learn about the electroshock therapy and why he had a\n[noise] well I think that Lou was acting\nUm did you interview all of them all three of them [noise] um yes [noise] what what were some of the themes that you got from them less common themes some all three of those relationships about how they were treated by lead [noise] um\nI think one thing that ran through those relationships or you know lose early relationships with women was his desire to subsumed them you know to make them part of his world\nUm you know needy is a word that came up a lot\nA and talking about lose relationship with lovers and um [noise] uh you know part of that was you know he I mean ... hated being alone a at any time and so\nYou know that obviously put demands on the relationship but also he wanted\nYou know these women you know in in certain instances to come and work for him you know was lighting designer our manager or just be with him all the time or you know record companies would call them and just say look we lose you know feeling this or doing that is it possible for you to calm and you know calm him down\nI'm so there was that but there was also you know they also talks about a kind of sweetness\nMean Shelly all been his college girlfriend um there's just a delightful person I've gotten to know are a bit uh talk about you know just the difficult I mean ... would hide drugs in her dorm room you actually gotten kicked out of schools could have gotten arrested you know it was\nYou know it was not a nice thing to do to somebody that you cared about\nBut you know when she was talking about the difficulties of you know he's having affairs with boys and with girls than using drugs and and then she just said you know but still like Lew is the only boyfriend I ever had\nWho on Valentine's Day gave me you know this gigantic red heart shaped box of chocolates you know and he loved the I mean there was a kind of convention analogy to him you know he would a gesture like that would you would seem really meaningful to him he married his second wife on Valentine's Day\nAnd you know those kinds of aspects of who he was um you know ... what ran through this kind of double miss you know this this kind of burying these women in himself at the same time as\nYou know that kind of sweetness that you wouldn't necessarily anticipate\nThat ... that his first wife told you that he physically abused care\nWhich is the ... which is actually finally left him right did you hear that found from any of the other women he might as well\n[noise] uh no I did not uh and although you know there were other instances of other women who were less casually involved a with him [noise]\nAh you know it was you know I'm a part of who he was I mean that kind of anger and desire for control manifested itself and that you know obviously despicable lie a and you know ... ... ... certainly felt it you know there was a um [noise]\nYou know I don't this is not to justify this there's a song called Caroline says two on Berlin and or the lyrics go Caroline says she gets up off the floor you could hit me all you want to but I don't love you anymore\nAnd first of all I mean in four lines that's like a little movie\nAnd it gets that the kind of desperation in the hitter you know I think that there was a an incredible level of fear of abandonment and\nAnd terror and that's what motivated his violence you know it was\nYou know and no way I mean it was I mean it doesn't matter what the motivations were to a certain extent unless you're trying to understand this person um you know it's it's a heinous act but it it's coming out of a kind of desperation I mean it's less about hostility than uh\nThan it is a ... about a kind of self hatred and and fear\nAnd he's out there like me and drinking and using drugs and who knows how how that's affecting him to certainly had it and having that much out of that's not that's not helpful if you have a bad temper and if you have a tendency to be out of control [laughter] certainly\nNot yeah certainly not and it was a [noise] you know that was very much part of his life um you know in those days\nI'm One of his partners for about three years was transferred his um\n... Shaffir yeah yeah yeah she was\nAnd so they went together for two or three years and um he dedicated his album Coney Island baby to her her name uh west Rachel\nI'm what can you tell us about Rachel in her relationship with really well that's a you know that kind of story\nRight it is extremely complicated subject I'll Try to distill it you know it's um [noise] you know he met a Rachel in an after hours bar and just really fell in love with her and this was one of the revelations that the book\nTo me you know I knew about Rachel I mean he wrote about her so uh yeah I was aware that she existed but you know in my mind you know in a casual ... Lew these wild he'll do anything\nBut in fact there was a real depth to that relationship and you know they had\nYou know they live together or they entertain together they went out together it was ... I mean if uh you know if a if a rock star lose stature did that now it would be you know regardless of their shocking and you know certainly in the seventies\nYou know it was you know just kind of unheard of\nBut um you know there was genuine affection there and also Rachel is kind of also a kind of road manager for the very interesting thing I was a contemporary peace where a a writer named Caroline Kuhn a British writer was writing about being with Lou and Rachel and they were kind of arguing like Louis saying\nWhat's going on here like you are supposed to take care of me like why am I taking care of you and it was sort of playful and it was a fight and that was also a reality to it you know like\nYou are supposed to be arranging the cars to the venue and you're supposed to be talking about what I Need like\nThe ... you know uh why am I looking after you know you and your problems But Rachel had a secret life you know Rachel was out on the street and would um\nYou know she pulled a knife on a girl who was looking at Lew backstage at the bottom line you know just wander off\nOr you know people will recall seeing a Rachel I'm you know beaten up not as a result of a relationship would lose seemingly but you know just out of the other kind of\nA situation that she would get involved in and it was\nA you know that kind of thing I think really has an appeal for Lu the idea that I think anybody who didn't fully um submit to him he didn't fully become part of his world who kept something to themselves\nOr I think that that only kind of enticed his interests and uh\nYou know a Rachel's life as a hustler was who was something I think that had a real appeal from the\nWell let's take a short break here and then ... if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony Curtis the author of Lou Reed uh life will be right back this is fresh\nAnd this is often NPR station K U T Ninety point five\nSupport comes from the American Cancer Society and often everyday cancer patients struggled to find transportation to get treatment the American Cancer Society needs volunteers now to help drive patients to their medical appointments learned more cancer dot org backslash Dr ...\nSupport comes from the Boston symphony and their annual Halloween children's concert Sunday October twenty eight at one PM in four pm at the AINS\nThe performing arts center detail that often symphony dot org oh\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rights are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nAnd from tulip pictures presenting ... inspired by events in Mexico's Bermuda Triangle\nThe zone of silence to save her son's life a woman must find a stone that holds the power to turn back time in select theaters today\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Anthony ...
