something that's kind of been\nKind of obscured lately is how significant rocks the latest for live music is it just because rock and roll has been around show much longer than than rap and hip hop and all the rest there are several reasons rock also crosses generations in a way that rap doesn't at a rock concert you could have a younger\nA millennial a Gen Z a music fan who is curious about a

like so incredibly high tech and now fifty years later seeing a reproductions of the technology that was used and it looks so relatively low tax\nI mean card dashboard look more high tech today and some of the control panels in space capsule um they're they're they're like knobs and ...\nAnd a lot meters [laughter] yeah it makes you wonder like how did they do this how do they do this without the kind of computer and digital technology that we have today\nWas the it makes it even more astonishing I think you know it is astonishing enough that human beings have ever walked in the moon but that they did it over fifty years ago um with the technology that they had\nYou know these capsules we're not really a I Would say we're not kind of reassuring to look at when you're about to get into them how they're tiny they're rickety are\nThey as you say are totally kind of analog and feel I mean I often they feel more like extensions of the machine age them the space age they feel like things that you would expect out of a World War two submarine or tank movie\nVery much the opposite I think of how at least my generation grew up thinking about space travel which was high tech which was you know it it was a everything having to do with space travel in the movies was sleek and grand and clean and just the epitome of technology um and really this was a\nThis is a time where you know we were being thrust into the future before the future it arrived and I've just find that fascinating you have a group of people literally making it up as they go along\n[noise] you know an example of all the things that could possibly go wrong in um the gym and I ate flight the this is like the first there's going to be the test of the first space craft to dock with another spacecraft to see if that's possible [laughter] and so you know a Neil Armstrong's on on that mission\nAnd actually is getting strapped in to the space capsule before takeoff\nAnd there's really daring and dangerous mission they realize the seatbelt isn't working like the mechanism stock and well one of the members of the tech who says hey does anybody have a Swiss army knife and it just makes you think about if the seatbelt isn't working just think about all the things that could possibly go wrong\nUm and that kind of constant theme of the movie like all the things that could possibly go wrong and how amazing it is that any of this happened\nIt was one of the big things I wanted to try to get across because I think ah we almost take the moon landing for granted today and and maybe it's because the sort of image of NASA at that time and and that we've lived with sense was this sort of high tech image you described in this kind of image of\nOf a sort of be hitting me of technology and the epitome of individuals' this idea of superheroes basically walking among us who did these deeds that were almost easy for them because they were just so super heroic um\nAnd I think it's much more interesting to think of these people as ordinary human beings are working with the limited technology that they had you know scrounging things together figuring stuff out fixing things with Swiss army knives doing calculations with pencils and paper\nA and also you know the families I think there's a whole untold story of kind of what this actually met on a family level and so to me it was really important to you know at every juncture be looking at Neal\nIn conjunction with with Janet with Jan and Armstrong who I was lucky to spend time with 'em before she passed away and and and and talk to about this period in their life and just you know what that means to a marriage what it means to\nA family where you're trying to raise kids you know it it Neal's case to\nYou know literally perform you know for example this Gemini mission which came disclosed resulting in his death\nOr something I didn't know about it was a total New York ... in space that almost cost the lives of two astronauts an end to the program right then in the mid sixties or any comes home and has to you know take out the trash including the pool and help make his kids breakfast in the morning how do you how do you balance those two things I think I just I found that fascinating\nYeah okay so you mentioned that the ... this mission nearly ended in catastrophe after um after his space craft\nDocs with the fuel space craft in space the first time one space craft has docked with another the whole thing gets out of control and he thinks it's like the the the spacecraft that he's talked with\nThat's causing everything to be out of control so he ... and then realized no it's the spacecraft he's in out of control and he's just kind of spinning and and tumbling and\nIt's noisy and it's it's it's vibrating like crazy can you talk about shooting that scene because you have several scenes where you can just experience the the and the extremes\nOf being I'm In space capsule and this case because it's kind of lost control but in other cases you're entering or leaving earth's atmosphere and it's a ... right so why don't you talk about that spacecraft seen Africa after they dock\nWanted space flight to feel really physical in this movie you know and for you to feel the the the blood sweat and tears so to speak um but of course also those moments of of all and grand jury that surprisingly can kind of pop up um and I think what was interesting about the gym night mission was a\nYou know on the one hand you have this uh this incredible accomplishment of two vehicles documents space without without that accomplishment the moon landing would not have been possible so it was a necessary step a and it was the first step that America ever beat the Russians to an entire history of the space program or the Russians have beat America on every single other juncture beforehand\nAnd so you have this sort of you know everyone kind of feeling like a like royalty as they should\nAnd right away you know almost like a trick of fate this problem you you described began and it's not just that it was a this you know kind of immediately life threatening issue but uh but also the confusion of it um and so keeping the camera inside the capsule as much as possible not sort of\nKind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture that was just able to do the impossible without complaint and uh you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know you you're you're you're moving from place to place you miss if you say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a test pilot the ex Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and away eighty percent of the time and who knows you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just looked at me and and all of us with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course that's complicated is that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moment to the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a insists to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return so it made him\nDo that in real life yeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jim mansions book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with er about it and you know talk through what the conversation actually wasn't been what the issue and dinner table conversation actually wasn't meant\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she wreck collected and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his hands saying I might not make it back like she demanded that he has to do next she wasn't going to do it he has yet and and he has been in this incredible\nLike low key way without really that really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nUh I think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and actually sitting down and facing them or you know and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear\nOr they were a married couple without any fear except for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] um congestion her which did the score for the film and you also work with him on whiplash and not on land you met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um\nI Know music is very important to you gearing to the moon landing sequence um there's music that chance to me like part military part like western theme music and\nYou Star Trek referred to space has the final frontier [laughter] so I think ... to have a kind of western an edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military ... kind of galloping like horses in less than\nA well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping could sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflecting Neal state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kind of get a sense of it when you listen to the ... ah themselves it's these are the intercom when you come to\nThe ah sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept calm and mission control and whatnot um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you know listen to all of it on line and and ah\nUm it's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I I get the sense that Neal was going to a was going to land a thing I wasn't going to be stopped in and uh you know a everyone had come too far at that point to turn around and and uh\nAnd you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know that those are things that I didn't really know about when I first\nThought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music wise if we could get in to Neal's mine space that we can get into that sense of just a relentless on stopping drive um ah it would it would set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music this moon landing music\nX. men landing music from just in her late to score\nFirst man and a movie that Neil Armstrong and his various space missions and then landing on the moon and becoming the first man to walk on the moon ... directed the movie he also directed not on land and ...\nThey're saying that your film is become controversial for in some circles as that you didn't show Neal Armstrong planting the flat on among which is a you know famous moment that was related you know in real time on camera ...\nAn excerpt of a transcript from what I'm President Trump said to the conservative\nPublication the Daily Caller and this is from September for\nThe interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that they're planning on the front which not shown he was asked do you think that's a setting and Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of they tell me it's like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America\nI think it's a terrible thing because when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then you have to think that people should go see the movie and ... says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on ... Khan kept her neck and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions of something like that or get aroused I think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times so to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know in showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely in a steady choice not a political one to a focus on\nMeals private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes in the litter surface we really wanted to spend that time to look at\nThings that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as the first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater\nDuring which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process but what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nIs marketplace I'm ... result retirees and others in this economy who get social six", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "11"}
