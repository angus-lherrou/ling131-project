Hi I'm Jennifer ...\nIt's been a couple of get a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by\nPoliticians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users than a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walk to the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixty ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to\nThose what journalists and pundits with it yeah basically\nAnd they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this lawsuit ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I I mean I think for a publisher and this was kind of a fucking costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources then Facebook ads they see me as the kind of getting into that traffic so it looks as representing video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook that jumping publishers they okay Hi man they invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six year twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writer even higher video producer is how\nThis happened to places like ah MTV News and having to block it airs\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said we were ... were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they from President and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that he's looking plate of a number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of your accounts\n[noise] part of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't getting their own homework and art keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the news room people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted hum because of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing it's like is doing and they think that this could be at and and they kind of just jumped to both eat\nWhat is Facebook out to separate so\nI Know a lot it is obviously are eating the fraud claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty six to ... when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\n... and we should say

times before getting clean each\nTime that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that the treatment centers bailed me or anything of that it just was that I just wasn't

person anymore but that you were you were walking over people you know anything at all it didn't bother you stealing from your family like\nJust just didn't register on you at all did it mean anything\nUm I think it did because I spent a lot of time when I was high\nTalking to my friends into myself and the other I mean anybody who would listen about how I was right and how I have the right to do this stuff and um you know I was justifying it all over and over so I think I probably wouldn't have spent that much time trying to convince myself and trying to convince everyone else if there wasn't a little piece of me\nThat was um you know did recognize a what a monster\nI turned into the other weird thing about crystal math is you know do stuff like um things that you know if I took a part of my computer 'cause it wasn't working and uncertain part my cell phone I could\nPut it all back together with my cell phone in the computer and then I Would make this like super computer something I mean here's like stuff that really made sense to me at the time\nAnd if you'd asked me I would've you know thought that I was being totally rational but you know I obviously I wasn't um it just completely messes up your perception of reality\n... how old were you when you started using and how long did you use\nUm well I I mean I started like smoking pot and stuff and when I was you know I'm consistently I guess when I was like twelve or smoking pot a lot uh and then you know in high school I you know smoke pot and drink and stuff but not super habitually but I guess when I was a\nSeventeen was really when I started smoking pot every day and then I started doing mushrooms acid and stuff and then ecstasy and then cocaine and then\nYou know everything else so last that I guess from you know when I was Seventeen and twenty five now and I have to your server so it must have been from about Seventeen to twenty three you know but with periods of interruption when I was in rehab or sober or whatever\nDavid there's there's a lot of guilt feelings that you express I'm In your memoir about your son's addiction and you worry whether it's anything you did or Saturn didn't do I didn't say\nThat might have led to his addiction or prevented him from giving it up sooner during this period when you felt guilty what did you feel guilty about what were the things that you thought you might have contributed to\nI felt guilty about everything I tried to look back in our lives and to say you know what was it that ultimately caused next to go so out of control and to come so close to dying you know was it the divorce you know when he was young\nYou know what is it the fact that I used drugs and that I was open about it and um you know it was it was too liberal and my I just didn't set limits that he needed I guess the ultimate answer is that I feel that it's unknowable what would cause a child to become so self destructive\nUm when you go to Ellen on which which um you know our our our I went through a lot of meetings\nAnd found that very useful or they say you know you didn't cause it you can't control it you can't cure it um you know the ... you can't cure it you can't control it I Believe you didn't cause it I'm not a hundred percent there yet\nNickel and your father was blaming himself for your addiction um where are you blaming him to\n[noise] um sometimes absolutely yeah it's it's easier to blame other people have to look at yourself um so what\nWhat did you blame when you when you would kind of put it on on him or at least but some of it on him what did you put their\n[noise] oh [noise] I don't know I mean uh uh some of it was um yeah sure about the divorce and you know moving me out of the city what I was little and I mean you know I'm ... I mean anything just you know refusing to let me borrow the car that night or something I mean you know I um\nYeah I mean I definitely spend a lotta time being really really angry with both my parents you know with everybody I mean in part of that I think was was just a you know another aspect of for another I'm part of denial or or whatever you know not wanting to take responsibility for my actions and things yeah\n[noise] there were times when you went to rehab willingly in times when you went against your will is that correct\nYes absolutely did it make a difference to the outcome whether you went there willingly or whether you went there against your will\nUm ... no not really I mean you know each rehab that I went to act like really helped me a lot and I learned more and more about myself and I learned more and more about you know this disease and and you know what it takes to stay sober and how to sort of learn how to take care of yourself and love yourself and everything\nI mean each time that I relapsed after going the treatment I don't think that that meant that those treatment centers bailed me or anything or that it just was that I just wasn't ready you know\nThis last treatments that are I went to I was absolutely did not want to go you know this is to to a little over two years ago and I was basically coerced into treatment and I you know once I got there I didn't want to stay there and it's not fun you know what I mean you're being told what to do every second of the day and\nYou know you have to sleep and room with three other people and so it's not like I mean if I could do if I could have done it without having to go to rehab I definitely would have preferred to do that and it's expensive to you know it's it's it's hard you know for sure\nYou know a lot of people say that if you're in ... you're not gonna\nYou're not really going to be ready to stop until your bottom doubt you seem to hit bottom like a whole bunch of times\nOne of which was when you're on guard so badly infected\nFrom shooting up that um when you went to the when you finally went to the emergency room the doctor thought you might need to amputate your arm\nWell somebody when the surgeon wouldn't eat and you take your arm yeah um so how how come incidents like that weren't enough to get you to think well I'd better stop I'm killing myself\nUm well I guess I'm a part of it I again is that I think that killing myself was okay with me you know I mean I I sort of knew that that was what I was\nDavid Sheff welcome back to ... ... thank you it's a pleasure to have you back addiction as a brain disease is one of the main points of view but but what you mean by that\nWell first of all Mick became a different person the only explanation I ultimately came to is that he was ill or at first I didn't believe it I thought you know he was just the selfish crazy teenager but\nBut then the more I learned I mean ten kids would go out after school smell smoke pot\nWhere the party on the Friday nights I'll I'll drink and one of those possibly two of those will become addicted so there's something different about that person there's something different about the brain and I've seen brain scans are there's so much research now that shows that people with addiction process drugs differently\nOr their neurological system is different a different part of the brain is in control you know we think about addiction as a morally reprehensible choice but\nA ... act crazy because in a way that they are\nSo you know you're right in the book that I'm going through detox is just the first step you know after you've given up the drug\nCan you've come out the other end you still need treatment and maybe not just you know it's a step kind of program maybe you really need psychiatric treatment and medication to help you through\nWhatever the problem was that ... to your addiction and the first place\nThere was this really dangerous idea for so long that all someone had to do with goes off drugs that had to detox you know they have to go through cold turkey and they would wake up in the morning and they'd Be Sober\nBeing sober is just the first step getting off drugs is just the first step and then treatment really begins if someone has psychological disorders most often they haven't been diagnosed whether they have or haven't they need to be treated if someone is struggling in some other ways in their life they\nNeed help you're right that young people are more susceptible to addiction and an addiction is especially dangerous for young people and this all has to do with the development of their brain the part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex is still developing\nWhen you're young to talk about the importance of that part of the brain in any on persons development and and then in addiction\nWhat kids are the most vulnerable to becoming addicted you know it's a really stressful time and their lives I mean we're competing in adolescence is really hard\nBut they're also is this underlying\nTeenagers' brains are developing more rapidly than at any other time in their lives\nBut all the um parts of the brain don't develop at the same time the final part of the brain which is associated with judgment in rational thinking is lagging a so it's not in control and meanwhile the first part of the brain to develop\nIs the rare portion which is associated with pleasure sinking seeking an impulsiveness so it's in control we always think about teenagers being impulsive you know they want to experiment they have all kinds of crazy reckless behavior\nA lot of it is because of that their brain hasn't developed to the point where they can moderate these impulses\nSo it's much more likely that kids are going to use drugs and they're more likely to use them excessively\nSo the development is even slower the part of the brain that normally would regulate it would help kids make better decisions isn't in control so they started using more and there's this cycle\nAnd that's where addiction comes from a Ninety percent of the people who become addicted started using when they were teenagers before they were Eighteen [noise]\nA lot of memoirs written by people who had been addict start within hitting bottom\n... you know the the absolutely worst imagine little thing that happened to them because of their addiction\nAnd then they hit bottom and then they go into rehab and seek treatment and then things start to turn around and then the the two book kind of begins and so many stories just like addicts stories that are are you know are told you know start again with like hitting bottom and\nI think a lot of people assume that if you love somebody who is addicted to a substance\nThat until they hit bottom and until they really realize that their life as a steak that their dignity is at stake that there's there's no way they're going to give up\nYou know the drug or alcohol and you make a point in the book that that's not necessarily true that if you love somebody who's an addict you don't need to wait till they hit bottom you can intervene and perhaps intervene effectively\nIf you love someone who's an addict and their use is life threatening you don't wait until they hit bottom because that can mean that they're going to die you have to do everything you can to get them in treatment and\nNow we know that it's too dangerous to wait for a person to hit bottom I mean people were told that they had to let their kids their husbands or wives whoever it was they had to stand back not to intervene left them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment center and say please help me\nThat idea it's so dangerous as killed so many people\nThe other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease which means that as long as it's not being treated it gets worse addiction as a disease like anything else it's like cancer like heart disease like diabetes and we know\nYou know at the first signs of serious illness we want to seek treatment\nIf someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases we\nWould bring them to a doctor to figure out what is going on we would not wait until the disease progressed so we want to intervene in the second we get a sense that there is a problem\nBut you know with addiction and this is different from cancer a person has to be willing to change to stop using\nAnd um I mean you can lock them up in an environment where they can't get drugs you or you know whether that's prison or or you know put them in rehab where there's not going to be any drugs but when they get out you know unless there's constant surveillance they still have to make that decision to\nTo not use 'em\nLet let me give me an example of a story that you've told about your son um when he was addicted that he would call you you know from the street and say you have to pick me up I think I'm dying you have to come get me and take me home and you you didn't want to do that 'cause\nYou've been burned before you take them home and he would he'd steal from you he would do things that would be dangerous for younger children to observe [noise]\nUm so you finally said to him no I'll pick you up and I'll take you to rehab\nAnd your son said no I don't want to go to rehab doesn't work for me you need to take me home and you said\nCall back when you're ready to go to rehab and you hung up so if you have to do that over again would you think that that was the right way of handling it\nNo I tried to do so many times to get him into treatment and I would do anything it took I Would drag him off the streets I searched for him when I could find him you know I I\nI just did whatever it took to get him into treatment and it hadn't worked every time he\nWould go into treatment he would do fine for a while and then he would relapse so my assumption was that relapse proved that the treatment hadn't worked but I now know is that many times not always but many times\nLasts as a part of this disease so addicts get sober a it's a chronic illness the craving doesn't go away unless it's being treated and relapses common that means that even though ... was resistant to going back into treatment\nEvery time I had to do whatever I could to get into treatment and when they called up begging me to go back telling me that he was going to die\nSo many times I I had succumbed I mean all I wanted to do with never mind to to to get him help but I just wanted to see him to see that he was alive\nBut I finally listened to the messages of these rehab programs that talk about this tough love thing and that he had to hit bottom and I hung up the phone and I wept\nBizarre thing I'd ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you basically had two options and I can think of one has to St Louis I'm actually I have need rehab I'm not picking up at all and the other is okay I'll take it home you chose the if I'm not driving you to rehab I'm not taking home in a while and you think you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nShe didn't register ... think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of course I was just petrified and I had a reason to because he could have gone out and scored an overdose in died\nIf I got him home at least they would have been off the
