when another new innovation the automobile arrived on city streets\nThe predominant reaction among most people was we have to restrict these crazy drivers and their machines\nSee before cars came along our streets were really different they were full of people walking playing biking riding horses pushing carts getting on and off street cars and they were all jostling for the same space in a kind of chaotic ballet\nBut then cars came along they're big they're fast they're made of metal and we're killing people by the thousands\nMore autos last more I knew the day was filled with grizzly

Thomas who had grown up from an early age interested in music\nAnd was a very successful emerging rapper ... outside of Chicago but unfortunately he'd also been drawn into the gang scene he was a gangster disciple and they wanted everyone to know it [noise]\nSo he often a crust Instagram YouTube would broadcast his affiliation with the disciples\nAnd he was the subject I'm not one or two but three assassination attempts by rival gang members he survives the first two and as he survives rather than you know the thinking twice or maybe laying low for bed\nHe posts bold new videos on YouTube physically challenging these folks that come at him again\nWhat we've seen in a gang violence across this country is that much of that has migrated to social media\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about space and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say finds your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment and something else that's happened as this game violence moves to social media is that it also means that violence is no longer about who's ... for a particular block\nBut games at the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people died yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted online\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception and it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just\nA eighty percent of fights and school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting and a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beef at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world will make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\n[noise] you have an interesting kind of look at ... at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and it it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and there are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring\nAnd the time a lot of people talk about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone\nThe trouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media\nYou have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating power to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook\nBut then authoritarians figure it out they figure out how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media\nAnd a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking of what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use as a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands and a Turkish prison so government can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China is presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system\nWhere essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say to a what you buy can all be monitored and has brought together and to a single school\nAnd she's pushing out messaging a shootout in fact in particularly I'm Around that period of Charlottesville she is so angry that right wing or are being blamed for this and she says it's this Internet conspiracy and the like\nAnd of course and she is a fake and how do we know that ... is a fake Angie is presenting herself with imagery that is actually Leonardo DiCaprio Z German girlfriend\nAnd what's interesting is that when reports then circulate online that Angie as a fake she attacks the people going after her basically to say that they're part of this a conspiracy theory\nAnd do you get this strange outcome where her fake messages get greater traction than the messages debunking her famous\nSo Andrew Jackson was a fake but she attracted a lot of ... quite a following on social media was that because she was so compelling or was it because there were many many other fake accounts or robotic accounts that were re tweeting or stuff\nSo and she was a ... she was a machine voice masquerading as a human on line\nAnd each of those as powerful in and of themselves but where they gain their true power is creating what are known as ... nets so for example a Angie was only one of at least sixty thousand Russian accounts in a single ... that infects Twitter almost like a cancer\nAnd its war being and twisting the American political dialogue\nBut what's fascinating is that it's not just about persuading the targets\nIt's about hijacking the network's own algorithms so these botnets Dr viral\nDifferent points of view that didn't push that up into the news feed it makes them trends so people even outside those networks begin to see them\nAnd the impact of this can be seen in examples that range from a brags that\nAbout one third of the online conversation related to ... war these artificial voices to or even just a couple of months ago the Mexican election same percentage one third where these artificial voices and of course they played a huge impact in the American twenty sixteen election many people think it's going to do the same in the upcoming vote\n... just make sure we understand that we all know that you can establish a fake account or make up a name and get them to social media platform like Twitter and there are a lot of those but you're saying this this sixty thousand ... actually robotically generated accounts generating their messages is that right\nYes one of the challenges the space is that\nAh we don't have a good handle on the lingo so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not\nSo at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg who's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from Texas but then you have\nAlso boss these are machines these algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically\nThe combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands or tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now\nSomething that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate social media conversation something they're increasingly doing is creating accounts and having them lie dormant and have a a history of messages that seem authentic\nAnd benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road you'll be much harder to detect them as something other than a real person\nYou sent an amazing number here you said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know this\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts or one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nA at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake follow worse created to give the semblance of a massive online following that can then be turned into a real on line following by driving your messages viral\nRight but at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically a bot accounts generated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost think of like a\nSweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid to click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh and then you combine these physical people with pots and you can give you a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nTo challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big an number but an extent that campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAh it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans know half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on lie\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um Tennessee GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to\nEr there's actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing the echo effect and to the broader population\nIncluding the media itself\nOne of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman she was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like as if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was\nAnd if these Russians behind it and so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether it's swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and social media ...
