Castle station that has Alfred Hitchcock next time because everybody accused William Castle\nWho was king of the gimmicks and of the films of ripping off\nAlfred Hitchcock but in a way it was the other way around because offered Hitchcock people forget one psycho came out the big ad campaign was but no one can enter the theater wants to feature has been done which was unheard of at the time you forget people used to go to the movies and any time and just stay through to the next part of the film they never cleared the theater\nSo there was a clock and every box office so you know and it was a big big gimmick so in a way he was king of the gimmicks also and he copied William Castle who went away did it\nFirst so I've always in a way like the second rate better I mean William Castle law like more than Alfred Hitchcock Jayne Mansfield I like to more than Marilyn Monroe\nFell menial I liked him really a lot though I didn't feel he was inferior but he was maybe I like sell miniature even more than James Dean I always like the wrong person I always rooted for the wrong person and I always\nThought that the people that other people thought were ugly were better looking and that's always been my life and and my career as kind of been based on that\nI Know you really like the kind of pitch for a movie like the William Castle come on but what I'm learning that you're not really cheated by because they promised\nThat men and sex and fleas and and they didn't ...\nI never feel cheated when I go to the movies even if I hate it it's an experience that's the cinematic experience and and that's why I started taking these pictures there's no such thing as a bad movie if you go to a movie watching detail only if you really hate the movie just look at the lamps\nAnd pretend the movie is about lamps and and and and then\nNever as it boring it's always exciting and it's always surprising you can even the continuity mistakes within the lamps\nAnd you also have a series called NGO um that are still is from a Swedish\nClose our film well art some art meant dirty when I was wrong and that's the way it should stay anger was one of about ... we even\nYou know the Bergman movies when they first came out in Baltimore were sold effects films because I had a little bit of nudity and Sweden became a code word for dirty it's still the dirty bookshop in Baltimore is called the Sweden books [laughter]\nMaking this up so so I Love the idea I tried to put in the end but I just showed the back of somebody I showed no nudity I showed the one shot in effect film that you would never reproduce it would never become a still is is the sexy girl walking away from you out of focus a shop that no one would ever produced\nAll the still in the show are ones that would never be produced I did a whole theory called marks\nWhere I just took photograph off the floor when I was making the movie Packer of the tape marks the crew puts down that the actors have to have to stay in focus and that's the only thing in the shop everything that would be in the movie is gone the actors the costumes props and all that's left is the one thing you can't show in a movie still\nSince a few of the shots in your book allude to you know erotic movies or poor movies I'm Wondering how you discover pornography as I can [noise] gee how did I\nDiscover point as a kid Peyton place was the first dirty book I ever read it and I had heard about it certainly men bingo was another one and that's like kind of a great movie\nUm and playboy playboy was the first thing that you could ever really see now gay porn was a very very different thing there was a store called Sherman's downtown that had those magazines like van vigor and they were supposedly muscle man magazines but it was it was kind of a coded thing was the first gay magazines I ever saw\nDid your father have pornographic books or or ... magazines you learn that you could sneak peaks at\nNo he didn't but he did have Peyton place and I did read his copy of Peyton place\nEveryone had Peyton place my grandfather had pain ties Peyton place was the biggest number one bestseller for weeks and weeks and weeks and it led to Jackie's Suzanne that led to Jackie columns that led to that entire genre of work\nBut um but she did it first and she did it best and she has such great titles another one of her books with the tight white collar about pre that's such a good place [laughter]\nBut but she didn't handle success so well I mean she divorced her husband she moved to a plaza hotel and she drank too much and died basic rights so that's not the best a success story but the book was so famous that when I went back\nTo New Hampshire where where she wrote the book they still talk about her [laughter] and the town in the library I only had one tattered copy\nBut I did go to her grave and grace has been a a great heroine of mine\nWhen he started finding pornography and straight pornography what was like what was it like reading or seeing photos that were fetish seizing women's bodies when women's bodies weren't when it was an out for you\nWell when I looked at those pictures I always looked at it in a way to see how far could go the same way I went to um heterosexual sex location movies all the time that had no male noted to see how far could go I was interested in how the taboos would fall\nHow it started with a new discount movies where the first things I saw and and you would see bare breast some limit on some times assets\nBut once in a while a male asked but they have to be playing volleyball so you know that was not so erotic to me but I've never had a night where I met horny let's put it that way\n[laughter] you get to see the new this\nCan't movies and these were needed ... did you in movies and I'm obsessed and simply for supposed to be documentaries about healthy alternative lifestyles and they didn't really about the nudity where do they play where did you get to see them\nI can tell you right where one of my favorite theaters the wrecks movie theater in Baltimore which is now at church it when I was young it started out by saw the wizard of Oz there but it later became\nA new the movie theater I not only saw ... movies I saw the early Russ Meyer movie I saw a ... and it was one man and loan to who fought the censorship or we have the mail and censorship board\n\nO O\n... o\nSays on\nThat a\n\n\nSmall town ... fresh air so great to have their make up the I'm going to start by asking you to read from the first chapter role models in this chapter is about Johnny Mathis who was shockingly [laughter] one of your role model so why don't you read an excerpt at our cars\nI Wish I were Johnny Mathis some mainstream so popular so ironic perfect\nEffortlessly boy I should over Seventy years old with a voice that still makes all of America or want to make out heavenly warm\nYes I'll say it out loud wonderful wonderful is it because Johnny Mathis is the polar opposite of me a man whose greatest hits album was on the billboard charts for four hundred and Ninety ... consecutive weeks\nVersus me a cult filmmaker whose core audience no matter how much I've crossed over consists of minorities who can't even fit in with her own minorities\nDo we secretly idolize or imagine opposites\nShutters reading from his new book role models I was shocked to see that Johnny Mathis [laughter] when it's like the lead chapter fate probably lost [laughter] well I mean he's as a singer he's such a like a romantic and you're so not in your art I Can't speak about your private life so what is the attraction\nWell because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me because\nJohnny Mathis to me is the kind of mainstream that I Will never ever be able to have an everybody wants to have hit ... but at the same time Johnny Mathis said to me I always wanted to be a jazz singer\nSo in a way you're opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believe him to be too so I didn't know Johnny Mathis and to get to meet him was not easy because I'm sure that Google man I'd be nervous too [laughter]\nSo um he was lovely thought when I went to his house and everything\nSo I always assumed that the reason why Johnny Mathis didn't do a lot of interviews with because he was in the closet and didn't want to have to well I wrote\nThat saying that I was not coming to him with any agenda sects of moral racial anything and I did and I didn't and I I never asking those questions I don't really think obviously if you wanted to talk about any of his personal life he did he he just said some of my ... you know I I Know what he meant\nWhat does she have to share his public life with I'm not always for that\nYou know I get weary of reading these people that tell every personal thing to reporters they just met that day and that's what I'm going to say don't have friends that's what friends are foreign reporters [laughter]\n[noise] so you mentioned Tennessee Williams he's a chapter in your book role models and I'm going to ask you to read an excerpt of your chapter in Tennessee Williams\nTry this one is called ... okay the kindness of strangers\nLet me just say this is John Waters in St gassed his new book is called role models in each chapter is about somebody else who in one way or another was a role model or an inspiration for him so this is Tennessee Williams\nYears later Tennessee Williams saved my life\nThe first time I went to a gay bar or was Seventeen years old it was called the hot and it was in Washington DC some referred to it if the chicken pox and it was filled with early Nineteen sixties gay men and fluffy sweaters who cruise one another by calling table to table on phones provided by the bar\nI may be clear but I invest I remember thinking still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote I knew he would understand my dilemma\nTennessee never seem to fit the gay stereotype even them and sexual ambiguity of turmoil were always made appealing and exciting and if we're my type doesn't know who I Am he stated according to ... and even if the sex lives of those characters weren't always healthy\nThey certainly seemed hearty\nTennessee Williams was in a gay cliche so I have the confidence to try to not be one myself gay was not enough it was a good start however [laughter]\nSo he gave you confidence to be gay but not set a stereotype of what was going to have\nMe the confidence to be a beatnik revert to beatnik or to not even to be a beatnik was gay or for different you know you went into\nA field of all different kinds of rebels and their sexuality was always still my friends are doesn't matter if they're gay or straight if I'm friendly with somebody that has literally no interest to me whether I like the person or not\nI'm and I'm always amazed by people would say um\nOh you should go this age and he has all gay people were\nGoing to have like ... all black people that are being good or bad I mean that's what counts [noise]\nSo um I I always liked the gay people that had trouble even sitting in the gay stereotype because I don't like rules of any kind and I see people that break some with happiness and I'm not bringing pain to themselves\nSo how have you changed in terms of what you want to do with with your same endless people's interest in your life because in some ways you've turned yourself into your art in it because you've you do shows yeah when that shows you've written were personally\nUh you know all over the years and it the people are dying here that you\nWell I don't know I'm I use my own personality to find out about others my personality is wide probably for something in the house or why the outsider pornographer if I left in the house let me in a trusted me\nAnd I think I've only written about people but but I look up to about ... even if they've had terrible things happen because\nThey've had a more extreme wife than I've ever had and I respect people I I as a writer every day I think what would you like to be that person and if you're a journalist or a writer you get to be that person wouldn't everybody like the barge and people's health and a half of personal questions I don't get why everybody doesn't want to do that\nBut when you're running a book you're allowed to do that that's acceptable\nAnd that's why people tell me everything on an airplane strangers confided to me the most deepest darkest secrets\nAnd I think because they think oh understand and I generally do understand I've taught in prison I've counseled people I I I actually would be a good defense lawyer I Would be a good count for I Would be a good shrink actually and I believe in all those things I've been arrested I've been to a psychiatrist\nSo I think you have to participate in whatever business didn't you were you were trying to be involved them\nSo getting back to Tennessee Williams you've read all of his books and you've read the wall of lots of people [laughter] you collect books you have over a thousand four hundred bucks a catalog\nI'd like to read books I don't collect ... sometimes struggle service for like ... from what I read them yeah I like to read um people always say to me how can you read so much and I say that you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend and you don't watch television simply read all the time\nAnd I'm On airplanes all the time so it it's I Love to read of how I relax I don't find that a compulsion cataloging them as being\nJust being nice to my airs [laughter] do you have ... of course as much of a control freak because I Am you don't think I have my death plop and\nI've even know where I'm going to be buried we all bought plots a lot of my friends for like people's temple graveyard\nWell I Know and you say that a ... ... is it the same salmon herring that divides in um so why do you what if you don't my asking why do you want to be buried\nBecause I Love the idea of graveyards I like people visiting I used to go\nI'm great graveyards from Arizona and find would still flowers for parties\nWe'd have a couple of beers I liked the atmosphere I liked the worms go in the worms go out I Believe maybe I Believe in the resurrection the only thing I've ever talked to ... sounds like a good idea but then I panic about real estate prices and what we're supposed to wear on our renewed so I go into a bar my paranoia about the recession\nYou're the only person I've ever effort to who wants to be very 'cause like you really like graveyards [laughter]\nOh yeah I Do like a lot of people like ravens are peaceful they're quiet and we're all gonna be birds are friends kind of one stop shopping\nYou know if you want to come you can say Hi main kinds of everybody around and um I I liked the idea of it some and my mother at first I thought it would be stretched into my own family because my mother said I think that's a great idea because not your sister's going to be buried were husband that you know so\nSo um I I liked the idea is field there that you're not getting married next no\nAnd I was afraid to tell them they thought it was a fine idea they're totally understood I went to the graveyard where he is buried\nWouldn't wait quote China and my father we furnished motive meat prices that I didn't I never bought a great but it sounds like a rip off to me and they showed me like tunes like they thought Rudolph Valentino is coming out there they were going to [laughter] and um and I thought wait a minute so I went and asked the woman were divided up because I like the graveyard and she told me a priceless that I'll take a double\n[laughter] I got like a lot of room around me trigger the prices quite fair bathrooms [laughter] I forgot to better [laughter] to have you thought it through like what kind of like\nTim soon you'll have if I I kind of want it to be modeled after ... and I want mine to just say my father's is the same and I didn't realize it until I saw recently his grave or 'cause he only died a few years ago just say John F. waters junior today I was one of the day I was taught who wants to risk a joke that has to last year the turn of the humor changes\n[laughter] talk about an old joke on your I think it's the only time it should be quite simple on your grave stone was undermines I'm\nPraying hands but his parents put
