Austin\n\nChicken from judge Kaplan\nAnd with that declaration from Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine Brett Kavanaugh was put over the top I'm Jeremy hops in this hour a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote for the past three months the process has been polarizing and partisan what'd you say you've been through hell\nI I've been through a hell and and so\nThis has got a job interview this as hell contentious from the moment his name was ... and so I Will oppose him with everything I've got Kavanaugh's nomination almost derailed by accusations of sexual assault ain't here\nBecause I Believe as I said it did he tell you what happened to me having a and I were in high school\nSo how did we get here what does it mean for the court and the country with us for this NPR special report on the Kevin ... versus ...\nIt that the Senate is so closely divided it's a fifty one forty nine Senate um two Republicans are moderate\nRepublicans both women\nSusan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they split and then one Democrat went with Collins and it was basically all over I think that Susan Collins made probably the best case you can make for um for Brett Kavanaugh today at least in the public\nUh arena and she was the closer for the\nMajority leader the Republican majority leader and it's no accident that she did the closing it's no accident that there were two Democrat to Republican senators sitting behind her women senators who don't normally sit in those seats that was the\nPicture that Mitch McConnell wanted and Susan Collins I think completely she cast her vote in her terms honestly but ah she also serve the purposes of her majority leader\nDominican months in our NPR lead politics editor is also with us why do you think this was so partisan throughout\nHeather Jeremy well I mean one of the things I think is because\nWe don't have a um a filibuster anymore I mean it's ... it's gone you only need fifty one votes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee and\nThere's a lot of talk about who's to blame for that I Would say the Democrats are playing with matches and Republicans had a fire hose can I mean this is just a you know Republicans were able to essentially beat\nHarry Reid then minority leader or to uh get rid of the filibuster the requirement for sixty votes to pass\nA to have a Supreme Court nominee or for lower court nominees right now for the Supreme Court that's right right yeah read and Democrats were frustrated by the fact that Mitch McConnell had a lined the Republicans in lock step in unison\nAgainst a every single one of President Obama's pretty much every single one of President Obama's lower court nominees to the federal judiciary to at least slow things down so that Obama didn't remake the federal judiciary\nThat was frustrating to the president was frustrating for the ... ... then majority leader and he warned Republicans you said you keep it up and I'm going to get rid of the sixty vote requirement well Mitch McConnell said fine\nGo ahead you do that and when I get in charge then I'm going to get rid of it for the Supreme Court which is not at all what Harry Reid was talking about\nBut read did it and McConnell took took the to the vet took the bait and went and did it uh uh when he became majority leader and now here we are you know new Gorsuch wound up getting through that first nominee\nWith the a filibuster removed\nAnd now look what we have we have a situation where the Senate usually used to be called the upper chamber and sort of look down at the house because the houses where majority rules and\nSenators and and you know have to work together they have to get they have to have bipartisanship to get things done that's because they're forced to because of the sixty vote rule\nThat is done now for Supreme Court nominees and it very well may indicate a brand new of hotly partisan pitched political battle for every single Supreme Court nominee going forward\nWell NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell you've been watching all of this play out on Capitol Hill do you think that Republicans just played the game better they played the politics better and they figured out how to get what they wanted while\nDemocrats would say that they that Republicans got what they wanted 'em but Democrats are going to now turn this into a motivating force for their electorate in the midterms and beyond\nThis this ... this nomination in to begin with fired up their base about ... about court in the way that they've never really done before\nAnd this is kind of one of those situations where Democrats thinks that it may have changed the way that Democrats democratic voters are their base in general thinks about\nThe connection between the rights and issues that they believe in and the way they are inactive and protected and you're already seeing activists ... on Twitter saying that this is a rallying cry this is the moment when they change in a moment when they run against every single person who voted protests kept a\n... a Tom Goldstein publisher of scotusblog ... is with us as well as in Tom you've argued cases before the Supreme Court as you watched this process what did you think\nWell part of what's going on here is not just the fraud political environment but this one seat is so important that Justice Kennedy was our center vote\nAnd this really will install conservative very conservative majority and the Supreme Court potentially for decades assuming no unexpected\nHealth developments for justice rather leave the court um the other thing that I Would say is that uh it can be a little early to tell exactly what will get from judge Kavanaugh we should never make very solid predictions\nBut I Do think that the president got exactly what he was looking for in all likelihood and these and the people who voted for the president some of them holding their noses when they did it wanted exactly this and so the right in the country was deeply invested in this this is probably is higher priority as they can have\nAnd this was just said the Democrats really haven't really gotten how important the Supreme Court is maybe this will be the wakeup call for them uh other people will say that actually has caused conservatives to really realize the stakes of having control of the Congress and so maybe there'll be motivated it will be interesting to see how it\nPlays out you know a lot of people have compared this to what happened in Nineteen Ninety One with Clarence Thomas and of the sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill which you broke you covered how\nHow did this compare well one thing that it sort of interesting is that the Judiciary Committee then was dysfunctional because it was all male and didn't take her allegation seriously to begin with however it was more functional in a bipartisan way\nJoe Biden was and the chairman the Democrats actually controlled the Senate they actually kept Republicans in the loop pretty much about everything that went on\nA they didn't do they didn't send the FBI down to interview a Anita Hill without telling the Republicans what they had done and whenever they conduct\nYeah so I mean I thought after Bush versus Gore that the Supreme Court would take a serious hit and polling suggests otherwise so far the justices have been kind of impervious to all this\nBut as I say in game of Thrones a war is coming uh I really think that conservatives believe that the process is some evidence stacked against them not was saying the fact that Donald Trump got both of his nominees on the Supreme Court\nAnd the left is furious both about this confirmation and also the fact that Merrick Garland President Obama's nominee didn't even get a hearing much let's get voted on when a before President Trump was elected\nAnd I think that you were about to see both sides truly\nBreak the seals and treat the Supreme Court has a partisan institution I'm deeply worried about\nUh if Democrats take the house whether there will be impeachment hearings about Brett Kavanaugh because nobody stands up to defend the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court does something that you like you just think well that's because it's the law and if it does something you don't like you think it's because they're lawless partisans inactive is just as\nA and that's that is going to get worse I think\nI think the phrase is winter is coming and winter is in fact coming as we speak here in early October so maybe they were talking about now I'm not one of the things I've noticed I'm\nIs over the last couple of months even before the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh that if you saw demonstrations against Kavanaugh around the country that it tended to be middle aged women who felt or women in general who felt that they had\nThe most at stake Nina is that the case right\nNow with the Supreme Court they've ruled on so many different things and now with the new court it will be you know ... maybe different decisions\n[noise] well I think actually that the whole conversation about sexual assault has energized younger women\n... middle aged women remember when they had very few employment rights they were treated a in a way in ways that we would completely find unacceptable today even know they were covered by the civil rights act\nAnd so we've come a long way baby in some ways and not as long as you might think in others\nAnd that's what I think you're you are seeing a growing gender gap\nDoesn't mean it couldn't turn around a lot depends on you know we have a month to go until the election that doesn't sound like very much but in the modern social media world that's in a turn to be\nWell you know what I'm going to bring in Kelsey Snell here are congressional reporter says you brought that up the midterms are coming right up\nIs this going to be\nThe issue that people vote on a month from now we did also just see this week that the unemployment rate hit the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine which is also very important to people\nOne of the things we have talks a lot about and on the NPR politics team in general is the idea that anger and create entire typically ... better motivating forces for voters then happiness\nNow we've seen that in a number of issues and that's why a lot of Democrats are saying they think that it will be a motivating factor for their voters question is will remain loaded motivating factor for conservatives\nWho you know ... became more engaged in the longer this fight went on about cabinet but they now have what they want it yeah they won winners are not are less likely to feel motivated to go defend their when where losers are more likely to want to go and get a win for themselves\nSo in that regard I think it probably will be a big part of what happens in the mid ...\nLet me ask each of you a Tom and Nina what you think the other justices have been thinking as they've watched what we've just seen Nina\nWell my guess is that certainly the women justices are not happy I'm not happy with what they saw because that Kavanaugh's performance it wasn't\nJust part isn't it was hugely aggressive and I think probably they didn't like that uh I imagine the chief justice wasn't thrilled either\nI don't know how they I Do know that this is going to be very ... what we see in public\nWill not be what's going through their heads or or maybe they will demonstrate in private\nAs Supreme Court is like a marriage of nine and they're not getting out of it for a maybe forever so they have to figure out a way to live and work with one another that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of bad feelings beneath the surface and worries about the court is an institution\nSo a couple of things you know several of\nThem have been through very hard confirmations Justice Thomas justice ... to some extent justice Gorsuch the chief justice to some extent so there's going to be some level of sympathy and empathy\nOr because we've been there and we know how unfair it can be second they really care about the institution so without blaming anybody they're going to have hated what happened because the institution\nReally can only survive it has no army ... doesn't have any way to enforce its judgments as has often said to relies on public trust in being a fair and neutral institution and it has been portrayed as not that\nAnd it's also as a consequence incredibly important that they individually BPH perceived that way and so when they give speeches when they go to meetings when they just talk to people like they try incredibly hard to make sure they're conveying an impression\nAnd I don't think anybody thinks that that was the impression that was left by the final set of testimony by Brett Kavanaugh indeed you saw him right himself with some regrets about that just given the special circumstances and stresses and the moment\nYeah what about that or an op ed in the wall Street Journal from a nominee for the Supreme Court and after he had given an interview to Fox News both news organizations owned by Rupert Murdoch but um what did you say\nI Would advise and that was not good placement that he should have put it in a liberal newspaper not ... not on a conservative editorial page he should have made sure that the readers of the Washington Post which is after all his who was looking at at this today\nUh the readers the Washington Post we're getting a negative editorial and he should have had that it was not good placement at the very least\nHow well the other justices welcome him a ... for the open\nArms I think you know they they do really recognize as Nina put it so well the incredible need to be college all they get three months off from each other during the summer to take a little bit of a break but despite all their disagreements they recognize they have\nTo get along and that they are the only functioning branch of government practically and so I Would be very surprised if there was any overt or indication of him that anybody was trouble now the chief justice has a very special role in administering institution\nThere may be some efforts you know to kind of increase public confidence in the place as a as a nonpartisan institution but I Would I Would be shocked if there were troubles inside the building that were over\nThat it's on gold seeing or the publisher of scotusblog we're going to come back in a moment and talk about what\nA this entire cabinet nomination and confirmation means for the midterm
