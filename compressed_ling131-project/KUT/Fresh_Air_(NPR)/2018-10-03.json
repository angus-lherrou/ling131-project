people are the\nFirst news\nAgainst people who would abuse to animals I mean circuses and ranchers and so and so forth\nAnd that gets taken down and say kind of like you look at the specific instances of what happens why it's happened in almost every case there's some Trump supporter or Trump appointee who has some narrow financial interest in the removal of the data\nYou write about the environmental protection agency but this seems to fit with one of the themes that you write about in your book\nThe office at the EPA that give scientific input to the presidential administration the office of the science advisor\nThe plan is according to an anonymous source that in New York Times reported on the plan is to eliminate that job altogether does that fit into the themes that you've seen in three departments that you write about\nWell you know it's funny because the broad impulse so the Trump administration's been just not to fill the jobs I mean the top seven hundred jobs in the administration half of them are still unfilled\nAnd the ones that are filled are filled often very oddly by people who don't have the expertise for the job so I Would say the broader pattern is one of just general neglected misunderstanding\nWhat ... there's no question that Trump has been specifically hostile to environmental regulation\nAnd to the idea of climate change and it's pretty clear that the reason he's off though is he's got he's backed by by fossil fuels people um and where you do find places in ... in in my stories where\nWhere you can see the hand that handed work\nEither removing climate change data from websites are filling jobs that would be specifically addressing\nClimate and the environment with people who are totally inappropriate for the job so for example ah in the agriculture department the chief scientist the person who's in charge of distributing the three billion dollars a year the agriculture department distributes to for basic research\nThis research is done is done now almost entirely to find ways to adapt the food supply to climate change um I mean it's absolutely critical is not going to be done in the private sector they head of his job to a right wing talk show radio host or who would back Trump in Iowa\nI mean it's just that kind of thing is going on throughout the administration\n[noise] you're not smoking ... about a year ago after your second article on how Trump is running the federal government was published in Vanity Fair and and with Davey focused on the department of energy and agriculture you've added in your book the department of commerce and want to take a look at that\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce has very little to do with directly with commerce\nIf in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the ... a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day that collects all of a sudden we're able to parse the data and wait and usually the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a seemingly leave something that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in he sees the job is kind of like she trade negotiator which is odd because we have a cheap trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pools that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census\nAnd the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on census [noise] um I I don't know if there's a definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen census whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still they're still argument about whether they're going in ... on the census a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to the census as a citizen what we'll do is queer the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why 'cause a lot of people will be afraid to answer that\nQuestion if people would be afraid to answer the question that people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally so even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't he might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who were fearful so actually 'cause that's the back of a second they haven't even the gun to prepare this for the census I mean the the the real problem with is access is that it's way behind schedule and it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off is another question in there and certainly in this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latino from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the center\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're district need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn\nOf late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the data that the government collects is researchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example\nUm we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country if the data on prescription drugs had not been made available and not been possible\nIf we don't have a picture of what the society looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that we'll\nBecause the transition process is supposed to start with each candidate each candidate is supposed to be preparing\nAt some point as if they were going to become president so that they were briefed and they're up to speed if they do become president so the first sentence in your book is Christina Chris Christie noticed at peace in the New York times that's how it all started what was the article Christie notice and why did this article start [noise]\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this was still with the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had set representatives and the reason is that happened was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition and by law anybody who's likely to get elected\nThe cat is the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings and Christie saw this and he saw that\nThe person the Trump campaign said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running a campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the ... had nobody who could fill this role in didn't seem to care very much about filling this role that Christie was still so in support of Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going towards one is as Christie makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out\nTrump didn't run to when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the on the ... election he was running for ... as an exercise and brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and when people told him he had to spend money either his money or campaign money to build a transition team had become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars each scream at one point he said the Christie you know\nIf we win you and I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that they were above that smart [laughter] yeah well that's for sure if that's right so this is another theme that underlies all of this and the and the Trump operation the presence of rich people Trump and especially in Jared Kushner there's this sense that\nThey both think that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's gonna win and not being really interested in the subject at all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law any bills actually\nI think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments and receive the government from the ... the Obama administration\nIs so they bomb and Mr ... has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and if it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with the Zika virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems this is what this department does\n... this is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings\nWhy did he fire them [noise]\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told him to end the jar cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey it put Kushner's father in jail\nBut that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to questionnaire and there's also no reason you couldn't have just fired Christian kept everybody else on board I think what happened was that the number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor\nOr were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs in the government and they were left off the list because the transition timid vet it all these people and found the problems with them\nSo some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they persuaded Trump to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened in a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run a you're terrified to get rid of the people who were going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was this that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was a law they had to do it they didn't have any choice\nTrump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being spent but no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win\nSo Jared Kushner although we oversaw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused I think it ... he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought the job was going to be done\nIf you're just joining us now I guess as Michael Lewis and his new book is called the ... his risk and the book is about the federal government under President

risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examined\nThe energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAfter President Trump was inaugurated he sent in what you just got a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what what's the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people and the secretary's office\nAnd listened politely and didn't take notes and the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team we send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to him for questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names\nBut he ... the bigger point was he came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels\nAnd it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative
