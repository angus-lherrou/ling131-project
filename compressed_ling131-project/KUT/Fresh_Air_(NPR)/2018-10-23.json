[laughter] what do you think listening back to ...\nI it's strange to hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so rattling I always wanted to\nKnow whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you with that design a lot of folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nNo ... no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that than a million years um my friend Ken sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles ah he\nCalled and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do impersonation so I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse and he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think you know just come in and can I can they send you to read\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw another rather you know insane\nPress conference where I thought well this is weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys\nAnd she's a you know a soft and we all like to cats so they would say outside they weren't you know it wasn't it wasn't like a a horror movie where\nThere's [laughter] and are leaving their own [laughter] but uh you know\nAnd people would put boxes of cats like in our driveway I always thought it was kind of sad and and terrible but we we take them in and this kid's we'd love it I think I think it did definitely frightened parents of my friends the first time in the first time I got taken home\nThere was always a bit of a catch in my chest of like\nWhen they finally get down on the gravel road and they pulled into the driveway there are going to be twenty five cats that rush out to the car in a very friendly way but it does seem like oh and this is this is how will all be killed and I just remember the first time parents were always like\nOh my God oh my God I'm like it's fine I'll get out here I'll just get out here and they're like well why do you have so many cats and you\nKnow it's like an eighty eight year old kid you're like well I'm you know we just take them in and it's not as weird as it looks meanwhile you know they were just like\nGet out get out of the car when did you see them you must have had a lot of cat food there's a lot of cat food there were we'd make like big pictures of food I remember using ... I've not thought about this\nWe I Believe these like carnation powdered milk and we'd like rip up bread and lots of cat food and make this kind of stew concoction and then go out on the back porch and you know in ... the cats and [laughter]\nThat's a lot of thought to come running at one point you know especially if some of the cats were newer and a little more slightly feral my mom was very I'm aware\nOf making sure all the cats got pets so they got used to people and used to being around and she's really sweet so Sandy would always pet each cat while they were eating and make sure that they got used to like people touching them and at one point she was out there doing that and when she stood up she realized that one of the cats was a skunk\n[laughter] she [laughter] she had been shouting and heading this like you like that is that a\nGood dinner and then she stood up and the light that she had been blocking with her body the light hit the skunk\nSo yeah that was the all all were welcome my guess is the take away their hopes you didn't get sprayed by this gunk she didn't it just kept eating she kind of you know it's probably the only time for sure we've got pet by human\n[noise] most of the coffee at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came for us like acting or comedy that combination standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and\nI moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue have had ... living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh\nHad a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nThat night he found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day 'cause\nNot 'cause I'd necessarily talked about stand up but I think I kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I think you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kind of thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school I had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to\nYes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but\nIt was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designers studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm going to go this direction [laughter]\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\n[laughter] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was a stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and and I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seemed so you could just typical and narcissistic and\nI thought oh they're not liking this and they get harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I\nDo remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself I'm not complimenting myself and then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this is really fun\nThis is really strange and fun and such a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged and he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on this miss why I I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could be more ridiculous and more bold and brazen and\nI Would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt a great freedom in that\nThat would you always dress the way you described a\n... yeah I was always recognize lately completely ... in a different I was always in a huge leg to some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now is a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up at night and they would throw in one of his like you know are we we're ... swing Cape or some kind of scuba suit thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous and and fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and
