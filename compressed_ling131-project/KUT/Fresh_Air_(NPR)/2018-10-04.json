but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess where the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it and to me family means I can still sort of my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different in the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking serve your regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening away from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road she'll be happens is too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just like just like\nThe tariffs can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like James who can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in the second but but but look let me back you up for me on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait a minute I mean I I I Want to it but the good in the back yard so far so good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave us freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities ... capital markets\nAnd yes it can be quite a real issue and we studied it and they're ... to it the economy's been going in ... and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but lord and or fix the American public will do everything we talk about their or fix this war we put our minds to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it I appreciate the\nPositivity normally I Do some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for and your letter which is intelligence thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have their slipping a bit to make all that we have not had war we countered Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's actually quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're actually practice trade issue a medical skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade\nWhat so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into\nThat look we have revised the president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have an annual lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand that you should the China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property down enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method work I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of ... or ... eight million companies in America I\nMean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy in a lot of other big banks so I'm I I'm going to be competing window of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to work more in the market value there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find their Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also practical one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and so I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want Jake more chase me the best bank in the world\nI wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would be I think would be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWell so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because\nRemember scale economy is that is true for banks is true for auto companies are true for law industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients\nThat it's not the company because capitalism forces to return to the company lower our ... and also our size and diversity it's why we had no issues through the storm\n\nThere

couple in their forties trying to have a baby and going through fertility treatments that have taken over their lives today we talk with the writer and director cameras Jenkins who drew on her own experiences in her early forties when she and her husband turned to fertility treatments\nFaced with options like in vitro are having an egg donor\nShe says it's pretty alienating to hear a man saying okay let's get pregnant and uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter]\nAlso marine car getting reviews heartland a memoir about being broke in the richest country on earth the U.S [noise] that's coming up on fresh air\nPerson who's\nYeah you are at the same age when I interviewed you less than two thousand seven as Katherine ... plays in your new movie and I'm assuming that when we did that interview in two thousand seven you are in the process of trying to conceive\nWe were we thinking that's going to be my next movie\nNo I definitely wasn't thinking it was going to be my next movie and I when we were in the throes of it there was no uh although there's always that kind of perverse part I think of a writer or an artist that has the third eye in the middle of their forehead and they're\nKind of watching life as it's unfolding so maybe sometimes even in the most\n[noise] unsightly times\nAre places that they are kind of recording um what's happening uh so you know but that's not conscious but it must be happening somehow so at what point did\nYou know that is going to be the subject of my movie trying to\nI had I had a good friend uh when I was going through the ... when my husband and I were in the process of doing our own\nYou know artificial reproductive technology slash adoption by any means necessary approach to try and have a baby I had a friend a girlfriend her name's Rebecca and she's a documentary filmmaker and she was my confidant and when I spoke to her\nAbout what was happening she always said you know you should write the stuff down this would be really great material for a movie\nAnd I was horrified and just for ... like that is never going to happen Rebecca I Would never write about this stuff\nAnd obviously now I have a movie and I should write about it and I don't know exactly when I thought it was legal uh emotionally legal for myself but I did notice and actually Rebecca is one of the people among my friends soon after\nMy own struggle with trying to figure out how to get a baby um a lot of people I knew were\nStarting to fall fall into that situation also so I felt like it was almost a mini epidemic among my friends um and who were very specific kind of subset of New York people who had unusual\nLives sort of freelance lives that were writers and artists and filmmakers and journalists and they didn't have\nUm you know steady income and the same as nothing was regular that maybe they didn't have health insurance maybe they held on light not unlike the characters in the movie\nThey held on to their you know New York existence by their fingernails because they don't rent stabilized apartment they had tiny apartment towers are they going to start families they were pursuing their career and then suddenly they looked around and realize that\nThey were you know forty or over and oh my God we better you know what a you know they were arriving late to the table\nSo a spoiler on how many children do you have children I Do I have an eight year old has almost nine is that me it to him the film was dedicated it is [laughter] okay and you\nCan at odd [laughter] before we always think nobody is going to say that because it's like the very very end like right before you know thinking New York state for letting us shoot here like no one's sticking around for that [noise] um so I always thought it was so buried no one would notice now I have to stick around to the end of the credit so I can come from its ...\nShe was at Lincoln Center last night we I mean the movie premiered at the New York film festival last night and so which was a huge\nLike fantasy of mine because I've been going to the New York ... festival as a total liking nerdy young film person forever and never had a movie there and last night was\nThe first time and it was super exciting and actually no it was an audience but I did an eye on stage I was thinking everyone and then I said something about knowing my kind of it's like she's here isn't she and someone yelled out no and it was her [laughter] she got out there but of course she was there and yeah we got three songs from her which was really great\nDo you mind me asking if you adopted if you did ivy F\nWe did do we actually were pursuing not unlike the characters in the movie other sort of differently [noise]\nWe were pursuing international adoption and ivy F simultaneously um and ah yeah we were doing those things at the same time it was kind of like whatever happens first wins and an IV F. one and we got pregnant and finally had mia Taylor who was my daughter\nOkay we'll talk about that more or less of it later let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us I guess the hammer Jenkins she wrote and directed

and directed the new film private life starting pulled your body and Catherine on as a couple of trying to conceive each of them having problems with fertility so they're trying alternate means ivy F egg donor penny you name it [laughter]\nAnd adoption [noise] um so it's a comedy but it gets to like really serious issues within about marriage and about all the complications of trying to conceive [noise]\nUm she also made the savages and slums of Beverly Hills so the movie starts with the Catherine on character on her bed in her bikini underwear lying on her hip it's a kind of sexy pose\nI think it's fair to say than in your movie you give pretty equal weight to how the husband and wife are experiencing trying to conceive or to adopt and they they each have their own like emotional crises that they have to go through\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally and comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul ... portrait\nOf I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with a savages too when you're writing some thing but so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie and in stead of getting in a car and driving across the country ... I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like infertility land was important to me that it was a mutual\nI dunno crisis but it wasn't just her problem or I mean they're both falling apart they're they ah you know as they're heading up against the limitations of being a human being simultaneously it's not just her one\nOf the differences though is that it's the woman it's to Catherine ... character who's getting these hormonal injections that are affecting her mood they're affecting her whole life body balance so I think that that's\nYeah\nThere are other calls here emotionally incompetent [laughter] no no no incontinent continents ... yes because she says oh my God my shrink cut her really weird name for it I think I heard of that has been off it it I Know it's emotionally incontinent and that's why\nThe said a character goes ooh grows oh that's great oh that's funny yeah so did you go through that of feeling like you you didn't understand your own emotions that they were kind of a little out of control for you yeah I mean you are taking hormones I mean I think that just even if you weren't taking hormones\nOr if the hormones themselves didn't make you feel like that the process of going through the\nYou know going through ivy out for ... is so bizarre that psychologically it's upsetting and then on top of it you're injecting yourself with hormones that make you feel crazy and weird and it's just such a non natural ... nothing\nAs Paul later says there's ... there's been nothing natural about this so far why should we start now I mean it's so not natural\nThat it does you and um but you know there's a lot of indignities on the mail from the male point of view too I mean because you're saying but she has all the injections he sits in a collection room where he's you know expected to produce a sample\nUm and that's pretty demoralizing and then he has sperm blockage and has to go through some procedure is off screen but that has to do with some kind of biopsies in his testicle I mean it they're they're getting it\nFrom both ends you know when he has to do the sperm donation he's watching really awful [laughter]\nI think really cheap awful porn\nLooked like that was supplied by the fertility clinic is that right\nYeah well they that's what they do that's always such a bizarre like if you go you know you open a drawer at a doctor's office and stuff with porn magazines that just seems like somebody actually to go out and go shopping for those and bring them to the office like that's a you know that's [laughter]\nThat's medicine I don't know it's you know a medical offices and somebody has to go pick up [noise] go down the street and pick out some porn\nMagazines and some videos of poker Mahdi says like rolling his eyes instead of getting aroused [laughter] he's rolling their eyes at the point I I was hoping to find something better do you know [laughter] like something yeah yeah it's not very good call is not very good quality yeah [laughter]\nOkay um so um during the process of when trying alternate path of either conceiving do various fertility treatments or of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child to really feel like your child\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as a heterosexual couple that you have all the equipment to do this old fashioned thing which is to you know give birth to a child that represents\nHalf of you and half of your partner and when it is taken away for some reason\nI think it's traumatizing at first\nAnd then I think kind of like the characters in the movie\nYou tip toed towards different ideas of what it's really about\nIs it about giving birth to a baby or is it about becoming a parent um what is that what is the end goal and it it just starts changing and shifting I always find it really interesting when people like in the movie I there's like a lot of\nI don't know if the right word is comedy of manners or like when people are just saying oh my God I don't know why why why don't they just adopt\nAnd justice always tell us I was like oh my God why would they be going through this why don't they just adopt as if adopting is just the easiest thing on the planet\nLike oh you just go out to you know target and pick up a kid or something it's very difficult to adopt I mean it's complicated um egg donation is complicated IDF is complicated every way you have to get a baby that isn't lying in bed and having sex is complicated and people are so judgmental\nFrom the outside like well why don't they just adopt there's all these children out in the world that need adoption and\nNobody says that to people that go and have sex nobody climbs into their bed and say oh no why are you having sex right now to have a baby 'cause there's all these unwanted children out there you should go you know it's so presumptuous it's so um [noise]\nIt's so interesting and it's such a hot button thing for people I remember when my husband and I were in the throes of our fertility stuff\nRealizing that the people that I should be talking to the most for comfort and perspective we're all my gay friends because any of my gay friends that were trying to have babies had\nTo pursue complicated arrangements to get their kids they didn't have the opportunity to just lie in bed and have sex and have a baby so that was so normalized in gay people that want to have babies that I really was like this is where I should hang out I shouldn't hang out with all the header as [laughter]\nHave had such a great way where they can get drunk in line bed and have sex and I have a baby I'm just hanging out with all my gay friends because they know what this feels like because they have to figure out\nAn unusual path to getting a child not the you know old fashioned way let's put it that way so I really found like that was a safe place to be like a and it gave me a lot of perspective\nIf you're just joining us my guess is hemorrhaging and she wrote and directed the new film private life\nWhich shares Paul Giamatti and Catherine on as a couple in
