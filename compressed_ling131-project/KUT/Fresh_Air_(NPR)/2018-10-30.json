conversation on yourself about look this isn't what kind of be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we'd had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so everything was ... not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time read you were in uncertainty and and and not only does regular business ... show to produce the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away\nThan commissioner David Stern called me and he said Jeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go don't rush into the ground the generation that oh yeah oh my God it like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite cat [laughter]\nOn people ask me\nA a a word here about your family right I mean you talked about your dad do your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book talked about it in interviews about how this was a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial lead culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to fire brother what's that like\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary\nOne of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player an all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates\nAnd making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority\nTo accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke them your question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear number of years did you wait too long\nThat was like the my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff I Know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multi tasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever\nLet me show you don't get out of your [noise] is good you know you were in around\nOkay this is my

we're right okay now I had no way\nOf you know back way to get in ... operation\nAnd this is a really good a snapshot of you being able to run the far right from your office to the court right warm right\nAnd you know again going back to the players wanting to know who is standing with them who's behind them\nOr you know so it it's over altogether and as such awesome predator it wasn't only get

S. MCA that's the replacement for NAFTA that he negotiated\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats small for weeklong but anyway she called this the salt on our country and it sounds like people are being killed if you use the word solved\nUm how is the president's language his language that's very you know just getting in vain frightening words this group of migrants walking toward the border how is that language resonating among white nationalist\nLanguages hugely popular among white nationalist um I think also hugely damaging because when you're\nWhen you're talking to people as if they are at war which when you use words like on flop 'em\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin bathing as if they are at war and they're going to take drastic action and the sort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration in the country\nIs a big huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country and politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about\nThe the last ... hours right on gap is if you take out the last sentence the I'm going in that reads essentially like many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of post on strong front do every day these are widely held ideas at white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants\nFirst is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justified drastic and violent action\nOn President Trump has been calling himself\nA nationalist and some people are saying that's a really must work for white nationalists and that's ... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist\nAnd so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that a white nationalist feel like Donald Trump in some ways has been sort of we can get them ... and has been for ... years now I'm In ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so\nYou know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant that Donald Trump would read tweets a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact phrase white genocide would be spread dolls Donald Trump followers I think similarly when Donald Trump sort of\nSaid that he was on a nationalist and give it to the fence for nationalism a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is signaling the U.S that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies with some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nThe synagogue shooting rubber ... criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are saying he's not a nationalist he's a global is its global is the buzz word for Jewish\nYes the globe with is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish um and above worried that\nThe president himself and and many people close to him have used often but the final campaign ad\nOf of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was that was a criticism against global with with a picture of George Soros and five others all Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad a global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and you know and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if I'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power\nThey say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required\nSo the white nationalist movement has an end goal which is to separate the races for the good of everybody\nAnd your father actually try to enact that goal by trying to plan an overthrow of the government and the people\nOf a small Caribbean island Dominican to um to create like a white utopia there he and some of you know white nationalism buddies were armed they were they were in their car like with ammunition driving to the ship when they were stopped by\nLaw enforcement agents and your father spent three years in prison so he I mean he really deeply bought the idea that you could create that's like white nationalist utopia\nYeah yeah he from the time he was a teenager um he was raised in civil rights era Alabama and everybody around him that sort of normal casual southern racist ideas about segregation and\nWhat distinguished him was a feeling that it was not just an unfortunate thing that the schools are being integrated but that it was a cataclysmic moment that that was going to lead to a minority white America and it was going to\nIn western civilization and that he had to do something a dedicated his life to\nMaking people aware of that and the distinguishing factor for him was how extreme heat solve the problem was and how far forward he was thinking about it\nWhat was your vision for white nationalism what what did you foresee you weren't going to try to overthrow a Caribbean island and create a white utopia there that failed for your father did you have an alternate plan for\nLike a white space for white people to be in the independent of anybody of any race and not have to suffer interactions with them\nYeah I was convinced um that there was a lot of late and support for the\nTenets of white nationalism that race was super important than the immigration from non European countries was making things worse than that people believe that in large numbers and wouldn't vote for that and I I was born\nJust as a David Duke was winning his first campaign in Louisiana in Nineteen eighty nine and my dad was on the road are coming back because my mother was in labor and so I with you knew I yeah for a labor with me and so I knew from the time as a child that\nWhite nationalism as long as it was not necessarily calling itself white nationalism could win campaigns so I did things like\nRun little Republican county elections or demonstrate that I could win with the majority of the vote for white nationalist talking points that are very normal\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could holding their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worsen don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did that kind of do you feel like that for ... your plans for like a takeover of the Republican Party\nIs foiled my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organizer campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always to show that that could still work in the\nIn the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that broke Obama winning was a sign that white people with certain voting more strongly on a racist ideas not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with their lives Derek like the only person then who who was thinking that thought that with Obama running for president then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist I've done a with with dangerous effect is played to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that\nThirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by playing to these ideas of\nYour country is being taken away ah things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish that has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters them and it's what got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country as well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the\nRace issue exaggerated uh-huh right I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by having these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters\nDerek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride than\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts that were attended by majority white crowds in the south or in Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs sort of subtly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races\nThere are other ways that white white nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out on the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would\nOrganize little teams that are apparently on line it's ...\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and post some carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide saying that all all non white immigration into white countries as white genocide and\nWould talk about white pride talk or things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and try to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence\nAnd violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet Gary you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide\nThat white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and hour and ... and the and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section\nAnd that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nBy being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white miss and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the endpoint of the ideology is built on a fallacy and and\nHard sock and her business partner started the bagels and bloody tradition after the twenty sixteen presidential election so into action had about forty", "show_name": "Fresh Air
