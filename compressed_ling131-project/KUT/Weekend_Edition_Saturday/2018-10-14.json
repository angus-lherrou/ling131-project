Mexican culture to help guide his pursuit of improved health\nHector says he wants weighed more than three hundred and fifty pounds and was on the path to debilitating health issues if he did not take

trouble we've told me or something like that but\nThat's one of the things that I'm very happy or would that\nBe something that has worked for me I can say about this\nA solution for everyone but I went through the roof or people that wants to give it a try I like any scientist said was used ... something in the lab the how he'd reacts and then what do I learn from that\nFor people who want to

five on K U T Ninety points on it with\nSupport from the school of arts and humanities at St Edward's University\nThe time is seven forty one\nAnd their journey to the United states was not like that of what you would call typical quote unquote model minority or my mom was married to my dad when she was Seventeen but that was twenty three and when he came here he was actually undocumented you worked in\nKitchens and uh work baggage claim at JFK and somehow music was their refuge music was always playing in the house I grew up in so it was devotional Hindu spiritual music or been golly folk music and\nWas that place of respite or there was also a place of service um [noise]\nAnd I also grew up with this aphorism that if you want to worship God you surf people\nAnd so when I came to Los Angeles I was Nineteen I was very lucky to have one the first orchestral auditions I ever took in my life which was for the ... and then I saw Skid Row for the first time and I was overwhelmed with this community of people in walking distance of one of the greatest concert halls and the world\nThat ranges between ten to Fifteen thousand individuals on any given night who experience chronic homelessness many of whom are poor people of color many of whom have a diagnosed form of mental illness\nAnd that's the time where I met Nathaniel I should mention that there was already an ongoing relationship with his handled in a few members of the LA philharmonic and that's kind of how I joined that\nFamily if people um and very early on it became clear that Nathaniel deserve to be on any concert hall stage in the world but because he had a mental illness because he was homeless undoubtedly because he was black\nHe was a man the slightest held who lived in the second street tunnel in town penalty for Twenty years\nExtraordinary story in twenty tiny cofounded streets ... what was the idea behind that I mean it wasn't just about Nathaniel\nIt was about meeting the other Nathaniel is out there\nAnd\nVery early on when I joined the Monica the orchestra became family to me you know they adopted me as a\nNineteen year old boy you know they would invite them to their homes and we would be chamber music like proper music geeks and [laughter] you know a eat some great food and drink wine and and I thought wow well what would it be like to take that same joy and love of playing chamber music to an audience who would never have access to hear us in a concert hall\nSo started reaching out to clinics in shelters I'm anywhere that would have us VA hospitals eventually county jails um and we sort of presented these concerts as your typical outreach concert where we were just sort of play two movements of Beethoven and a couple of Christmas carols and kind of like\nWipe our hands clean and have done are good charity work for the for the year as musicians and yet it was our audiences in these spaces who would raise their hands and say\nWell what was the composer feeling when they wrote that 'cause I heard this and so this was actually one of the most ... suit and empathic\nAnd in caged audiences we ever encountered in our lives so they're very real sense it was our audiences that started to reflect him or her back to us to say where are you really here\nListening to speak it it seems that not only work with street symphony but you work as a musician is is about is an act of devotion on it is that what it feels like\nThat's very much of value I grew up with but at the same time I grew up in a household that happened to be\nA sort of surrounded with various kinds of trauma and abuse spine [noise]\n[noise] my parents grappled with various forms of severe trauma I think this is generational trauma going back to partition um\nIn in West Bengal buttons in India and Pakistan was separate separated and you know my parents never talked about this but there was an incredibly traumatic time for my grandparents and great grandparents were the last ancestral home and somehow that pressure and that from a false upon the firstborn son as I Am\nIn the new country to fix and corrects all of the moons of my family and that manifested as physical and verbal psychological abuse upon me and my brother very often [noise] music and the violin was literally\nA refuge for me\nWere as a very little boy I Would spend five or six seven hours a day practicing but I Would memorize my music very quickly and so I actually had this system where I Would read Harry Potter on my music stand because I'd already memorized same old sort of try coffee can show how\nWell let's see I was the same age as Harry as every one of the books came out [laughter] so I was you know between Lebanon Fifteen you know um it was an elaborate system but when I got caught oh man there are consequences\nAs I mentioned you are just awarded the MacArthur fellowships congratulations thank you it's a big thing um [noise] what was your reaction when you got to call them and what do you want to do with with this accolades\nI think I spent the first minute cursing at the committee [laughter] have you do [laughter] like what are you talking about\nI'm ... I'm Still reeling\nI'm Still trying to figure out what what's happening but it is such an investment of trust\nWhat I feel especially with the nomination process being secret and having happen for quite a few years that there must have been so many people who believed me and supported me and it brings tears to my eyes because they must have believed me when I didn't believe in myself\nAnd so the really hard work now begins of actually believing in myself and I'm being radically honest about ways in which I have always wanted to grow and evolve but didn't have the space to do so\nUm I get to choose for the first time\nHow I Want to be in the world\n\n\nLA philharmonic violinist VJ group to win at this year's recipients of the MacArthur Foundation fellowships also known as the genius grants thank you so much\n\nYou're listening to a weekend edition from NPR News BJ Lederman rights are seem to do 'cause the end of our\n... ... ...\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device\nLearn more it go to meeting dot com from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more Justin decorative a world\nLearn more at age eight W.

ubiquitous president on presents on TV is working for him or not\nThat's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks so much thank you\nIn these next few weeks before the November elections will be taking a look at what is often called identity politics and there's one divisive phrase that has been at the forefront of the way identity politics is expressed in public the political correctness that we have embraced enough\nAlready we have to stop was political correctness Americans have been choking on political correctness\nFreshman I guess you can't use freshman any first year you can't say right after he goes you're discriminating goes when he\nSeemed culture liberals supposedly love it conservative can't stand it or at least that's what we've been told but a new study by the group more in common shows something quite different political scientist Josh among wrote about this survey for the Atlantic and I asked him to explain the results\nWere first headline is just how many Americans things have political correctness has become a problem with our country is actually four out of five eighty percent of Americans feel worried about what kind of rule but its place in our disclose among the second big surprises but this was sort of narrative\nThat young people women perhaps people of color tend to really like political correctness an older white men are the ones who deeply opposed it and what's really striking is at best not at all what you've seen the data right the best proxies or education level and income\nUp sort of a white people are ... the less likely to fame for political correctness is a problem that people have cut all the people who are most likely to see it as a problem or a Hispanic or Native American\nIn the same way in terms of age very youngest um don't like it any better than older people on the other hand if you earn more than a hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a post graduate degree venue much more likely to like political crap\n[noise] the reason it's so interesting is because we often portray the country is divided right hopelessly your analysis says that there is quote and exhausted majority whose views are not actually so different from one another uh can you explain what that group is feeling right now\nYeah so it's easy to finger the sort of fifty percent of the population\nWill walk in every single way I'm almost fifty percent of the country who are just sort of racist and you don't have we have lots of hate speech\nAnd what we see in the study is that eighty percent of Americans dislike political correctness and eighty two percent or were you worried\nAbout a hate speech so most people I'm not racist but they also are a little concerned that if they say the wrong thing ... themselves a little bit wrong me they might somehow a come off as being hostile one but not so you know one of the people\nWho was talking in a focus group said look you know nowadays uh\nI'm not quite sure do I say you do I see Jewish do as a black or do I say African American and I feel like if I got the wrong people are going to show me and and then that's where this educational divide comes in because the kinds of people frankly who you know to listen to\nNPR every weekend to perhaps have a higher degree and so on they tend to be more comfortable knowing what to ride with that and watch that invest a lot of Americans who have good intentions who don't have faith in the hospital but they're just unsure about what was to choose\n[noise] yeah I I Want to kick the term Latin acts um which has gained popularity I'm Latina and and if I talk to members of my parents' generation they feel entirely excluded from that time the term is meant to be more inclusive write 'em but these terms can also make people feel like they're not in on the conversation\n[noise] yeah and that's what we just have to be self critical about what's actually going to achieve more racial equality in our country if you think that for your own political reasons like next is a better term to use than than Godspeed to you but I think if you talk to your fellow citizens and they kept for example about the ways in which\nHispanics are being discriminated against at the moment the United states but they don't use your for such Tom I think you should see the potential allies rather than denouncing them or as enemies\nWell how does that work how for example kind of politician run on progressive values um where the language doesn't alienate what this survey says is the vast majority of the country I mean how does it\nPractically ... well I think that's a huge difference between standing up for minorities that are under attack\nAnd talking about is no way which sounds like you have a sort of laundry list of all of a different groups that you have to win over the in order to win an election and I think that what's the difference between how ... talked about it and how have we talked about it actually\nI was struck for example by the way that Cory Booker argues for a set of progressive causes when he talks about why it is but we have to have more equity in high school education he always he talks about the fact that it's unjust\nTo the children and poor school districts um who don't get a good education but he also talks about the fact that we need to educate all of our citizens to the best abilities because we're in a global race of competitiveness with\nChina when he talks about a prison reform doesn't just talk about the injustice to the people who are imprisoned user talks about the huge costs to the taxpayer I think those are ways in which you're making the argument that is close to your hot but you're also trying to show why is that this is in everybody's interest\n[noise] I can hear\nLiberals listening to this conversation and say you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is the other side weaponize his words in a way that that that we cannot cede the ground and conservative listening to this conversation might think\nThey're always trying to label us as racist and the divide has become so vast in this country that people are

racial bias so it was utopia except that the workers were doing all the work and the British people were\nHaving this lovely lecture series and the life of the mind so and so many of the characters are real people they are Charles land is the heavy dictator of this town but most interesting to me of all is a woman named Mary Treat who was a lady scientist as they called them in those days a naturalist who\nCorresponded with Darwin\nAnd who ah worked with him through a correspondence on various experiments and she was really\nA strong advocate of Darwinian world view [noise]\nSo in that area you pick the sort of scientists like Mary Treat and an other characters and the journalists of that era against the demagogues in the form of the man who founded the town Charles lettuce right and then in this modern era the main character is also a journalist\nAnd the family has fallen on hard times are dealing with failing health care in poverty and unemployment\nAnd they're also debating the twenty sixteen election and they're feeling panic to the certainties of life for being swept away but differently\n[noise] yeah they also are experiencing this disorientation this was a family of people who really mostly followed all the rules the adults anyway have followed all the rules Willa the protagonist\nFeels like she did everything right she got her college degree she worked hard she's been a journalist for most of her career\nAnd in her mid fifties her magazine's fold it she was a great editor but there were no jobs for people like her\n... her husband is an academic and their family has followed his quest for ten years from city to town finally he got tenure and then his college folded so\nAll of the problems this family has\nOur problems that are um [laughter] you know sort of come from the the real life that we see [laughter] yeah I was gonna say sort of my standard you know meeting with friends you know afternoon with friends of the things we talk about our all of these things people are losing\nEvery kind of shelter even people who have not felt that they were particularly vulnerable a decade ago are finding that the rules have changed\nAnd that all of these various kinds of shelter that we've all counted on our crumbling so now [noise] you\nCompare these two era's quite pointedly with two of the of the leaders of\nOf that and this time the president Donald Trump ... although you don't name him and I don't know who you're talking about [laughter] and and Charles land is the sort of demagogue of of the town\nMhm [noise] it's really not about leaders so much as people's willingness to be led\nI'm interested as a novelist and you know the human psyche that's our our paint box we look at behavior and look at the different things people do in response to crisis\nYou got married treat saying I suppose it is in our nature when men fear\nThe loss of what they know they will follow any tyrant who promises to restore the old order yeah I did write that [laughter] this is a very political novel in as much as it grapples with the big themes of the moment climate change science journalism what is the role of art in this time\n[noise] I think the role of art in any time is to look past the door frame and the and the window frame into what's just outside our daily experience to try to broaden\nPeople's vision a little bit in any way that the novelist um feels capable of doing that\nAnd to create empathy for the theoretical stranger and I'm I wanted to look past blue states red states put\n\nBack because you live in Appalachia right and so you have a particularly unique perspective on\nThis I Do I live in a very rural place south western Virginia I also work in a profession that means most of my colleagues are in urban places mostly in New York so I Move between\nRed state and blue state between rural and urban between these two cultures that are so divided that they've really stop talking to each other they only talk about each other\nAnd I'm the bat you know that's not their men on the bird I have to fly between these cultures and see what I could rent or for the reader in terms of interest in in terms of sympathy\nI feel there's a bigger question looming over the book in comparing these two time separated by a hundred and fifty years in which many of the same issues are being debated\nHe's saying that there really is no progress and we always end up in the same place [noise] well I don't think it saying that exactly [noise]\nI Do think it's saying people are people um there are things about us\nThat will always be true one of them is that when we feel there's a scarcity we get real ... thumb [laughter]\nWe want to get hours I think it's deeply embedded in our nature in our DNA to be suspicious of the other of strangers are people who seem different from us these are all inclinations that's not to say it's how we should be or even that\nIt's how we always are but I also want to remind you that I write literature so I really work in the um domain of sentences and images and character and personality so\nAbove everything I Want this to be really fun to read\nIt's a great read
