polls show that just over fifty percent city support both ... of the area I mean has a lot of ... votes as [noise]\nYou know I'm hearing very high motions there the divisions in this country this anger\nThat said he is Sunday Morning in Brazil because they get off to a slow so people are still waking up\nBut we were at the polling station we were close to a just a moment ago and they say the tuna is funnier than usual um before all the gates Oakland there was a line of about a hundred people [noise]\nYou know a little snow has been this figure for quite some time very controversial figure in Brazil and it was always sort of predicted that he would never make it this far but support for him this surged in the last few days why is that\nHe suggests we call just a way of public anger about massive corruption in government about Brazil's recession between two thousand two thousand six the about the IRS about violent crime is a country whether over sixty thousand\nThese journals bull's eye using is not use it using wants to watch his main opponents ... was he was in government with the movie soon as he is\nInitially on the loose enough you'll go to the Silva who's now in jail

were massive rallies against him in recent weeks I'm ... explain why they're so worried [noise]\nWell you know you only have to look both in our has said over the years he has a long record of making offensive remarks\nAbout women about oh she'd be the uh people about to afro Brazilians are um you know use that that has made them very worried about what kind of a president he will make they're worried about his close ties to the ... tree\nAnd they're also worried about the fact that he openly and frequently expresses admiration for the military dictatorship that ruled in this country until a Nineteen Ninety five so\nFor anyone to win the presidency and the first round they need to get fifty percent plus one on could he went outright today\nHe could I mean he's been rising quite rapidly in the polls and the last few days the latest one how to just do the full ... percent of the boats and uh so it's not impossible given the fact\nThat you know these are just so\nIt it's not impossible but he could win today coming faces\n... that was absolutely unthinkable a few weeks ago even a week ago but now they're saying it might happen votes unlikely\nYou know this will have huge ramifications for the region Brazil is the biggest democracy the largest economy in Latin America with ties to countries all of the region in the world\nWhat are his policies but well he'd do if he went [noise]\nWell what we know from what people around them have been saying is that he tends to loosen environmental\nLaws and also just read them privatize I shouldn't give public allow them to bear arms unless the police use lethal force him even more amounts than they were ready\nThat's NPR's Philip Reeves covering the Brazil elections for thank you so much\nAnd tune in tomorrow MORNING

[noise]\nAnd some news from the art will now the secretive artist Banksy is known for the political street art he paints in cities around the world on friday night one of his paintings of a small girl and heart shaped red balloon just out of reach when to auction at southern cities in London and sold for almost one point four million dollars\nBut the room and presumably the paintings anonymous buyer or ... surprise I ask New York magazine's art critic Jerry salt to explain\nIt was being sold during the hammer went down over a million dollars suddenly started to rumbling buzz and the canvas short of disappeared drown into the frame\nAnd came up and eats it ... it was fantastic what was the reaction [noise]\nWell I think people were horrified amazed shocked the market is such a kind of ... organism people in the market by with other people in the market by and suddenly one of the things they are buying\nChange so he prank them maybe it is only a prank\nBut God if I could\nDo we know if ... had an idea that this is going to happen and of course the person who spent quite a bit of money on the art work\nI don't know the shock of it is part of what makes good but I liked that show him how an artist and artist that I don't necessarily like really was able to disrupt the system if only for a minute\nI Know you don't like the idea of of the market and and how influential it is on artist work but we'll just walk now be even more valuable\nEven shredded because it has garnered some tension without\nSeeing shooting just about it isn't it that the market as I say only buys with other people in the market have bought so now\nYes I was I think I was always imagining maybe becoming close to in some way my birth parents one or the other or both what I ended up finding or sisters in particular my only full sister Cindy\nAnd you know we've become incredibly close and that was that relationship was not something I I looked for not something I Would have expected\nAnd her daughter is my daughter's only cousin you know I'm getting to see them the next generation grow up together and seeing them grow old enough to ask questions about our family and how\nHow it came to be and how we came to get back together it's just been really really special\nStill because really honest and very ... about your upbringing how did your parents respond to reading it to sort of all of a sudden being able to see all the things that you went through\nI was anxious at first I'm sharing the story with them I knew I I very much wanted to write it and I knew I wanted them to see it\nUm and my father actually passed away my adoptive father passed away in the middle of reading it in January of this year and thank you um but by the time he passed he had read most of the parts that he was and and he loves it\nHe really appreciated that one of his goofy joke state and so people used to ask us all the time like where did they get you meaning me\nAnd my father would say oh if you put a polling a Hungarian together you get a Korean like where do you think they came from it's terrible joke it was his way of kind of saying maybe you shouldn't be asking the question [laughter] um one thing that my they both said to me was that\nThis isn't the book we would have written about our family or about your adoption that that's okay you know it's your story it's your perspective and I think they're proud\n[noise] in the book you have the scene where you are asked by a couple about ... what do you think of having been adopted a which is a pretty heavy question to ask anybody um and you write at the time that you weren't honest with them about your experience what would you say now you know I think\nIn a way I was I was honest to a point but I wasn't willing to kind of scraped deeper I remember sitting there thinking should I tell them about like the bullying should I tell them about all these questions that I\nHad and all the times I I wondered about my birth family and wondered why they've given me up it it seemed like a lot to lay on them but the the main thing was that I had not put down this burden that I still felt um sometimes I still feel to be honest\nOf China meat people's expectations as an adoptee because I Do love my family and I do want us in some sense to be seen as just like any other family and I\nI Want people to think that I look at me and seemed like a happy grateful well adjusted person you know um it was very difficult sometimes still is difficult for me to go beyond that and to sort of complicate that narrative but\nI Do think that there are a lot of important questions that people who want to adopt traditionally could be asking themselves many many are are you going to this realistically and have you really looked at your family your schools your neighborhood your religious organizations\nIf there were a child of color coming into your environment what would they find when they find mostly white people or would they be able to find people who shared their background and people they could connect with\nYou know I think if you're adopting across racial lines you know that is the beginning point\nNicole Chung her

our farmers' markets so farmers and ranchers can apply to this fund to not only receive a grant in times of emergency but also to help them expand their farms and ranches to bring more\nLocal sustainable food to our market\n... you often fermentation festival says it's not common to find a food festival of this caliber that is free and family friendly\nAnd so we thought it was really important in the next generation of making our our festival better to really welcome everyone and make it free so that anyone can attend\nLast Saturday extractive Hector Gonzalez and he has probably the most unique workshop because where every other workshop is about making food he's talking about how food made him Hector\nIs one of my dear friend so I'm very excited that he's going to be at the

it's talked about is creating healthy gut bacteria which can help with digestion\nIn ... case weight loss we think it's really wonderful to have\nHis perspective talking about his own journey incorporating fermenting foods and his health dirty but also I Love the fact that you know Hector is an incredible cook\nHe also comes from a very special angle because he is from Mexico and he incorporates fermenting foods into his diet in a way that's still stays true to his Mexican roots which is something that we think is really special I Want to highlight at the festival\nNext week you

I Will tell you that as a woman who does live in suburban America\nAnd and I try to talk to people and see where their heart is they were outraged at how judge Kavanaugh was treated as well as Dr Ford\nIf anything I feel it's suburban women have really waking up and said that could be my son that could be my husband sure but we learn how and that will work calling most polls do show that most college educated white women\nBelieve Ford suburban women make a decision every time they go to the polls as to who they're going to support they are not\nPart of this wave and this is ... and that women are just going to all go left and you really have people for example look at senator Collins\nBy no means the person you consider hard right but when she looks the evidence and puts it to the historical ends of looking at the Clinton and essentially how Bill Clinton was aided in bed by his wife while he victimize young intern I mean there's a certain point we have to say enough is enough\nAnd we need to get down to the business of leading our country and who better to do that than women on both sides of the aisle\nIn this last month what are you running on what's your pitch to getting people out to vote very\nSimple your vote matters you are going to be able to have\nGovernment that you want we're due process matters or constitutional values or reinforce and where we make sure that the threatening wave of so\n... ... from the left he stopped Missy Scheuer runs the conservative pack Mackey D's list speaking with us from Texas thank you so much thank you live\nAnd for view from the Democrats we're joined now from California by Charles Chamberlain executive director of the liberal packed democracy for America welcome to the program for having me holding this week shows the enthusiasm gap has all but disappeared [noise] what do you make of that Democrats have momentum seems they lost it\nYeah I'm not surprised that it's changed a bit of courses tightening we're past Labor Day this is when people start paying attention to elections\nAs the Republicans I continue to dig deeper and deeper into the whole that they've dug for themselves with the Kavanaugh appointment I'm we're going to see that we have a very very energized democratic base if we started at a ten which is where we've been to the last six months this certainly turned it up to ... eleven or a hundred\nBut this was a pretty brutal loss for the Democrats I mean I've heard many Democrats say the Democratic party gets out played all the time you're going into the midterms with a huge loss\nThat's certainly true but you know this was an unlivable fight from the beginning we don't control the house or Senate we don't control the house we don't control the presidency\nAnd now we don't control the Supreme Court a and I'm proud of the fact that you can see that the Democratic caucus held almost completely together a standing against it to fight regardless of whether or not they're going to win we fought on principles and on values that's what the American public wants to see from us\nAnd that's why they're going to reward us on election day\nBut that's what the Republicans say that the Democrats are trying to bring this nominee down no matter what whether it be over allegations of sexual misconduct in sexual assault\nOr whether it be on his on his record\nRight but what's wrong with that to both reasons are valid a he has a terrible right wing partisan record he was perjured himself he is a terrible judicial temperament and he's also been credibly accused of sexual assault any one of those for reasons are completely legitimate reasons to keep this guy off the court\nAnd the reason why they needed is tight fight tooth and nail every day to try to defeat him win or lose\nWe've seen in recent polls that women on this specifically white women and specifically suburban white women are leaning now more towards the Democrats but women were outraged when the Access Hollywood tape came out a white woman went for Trump and helped him win what do you think that makes twenty Eighteen different\nI think that we have a very a much more exciting\nA and engage democratic bays across across the board or we have an understanding that the future of the Democratic party anti America is with the leadership of black\nAnd brown people of color or throughout this country and that it progressive whites are a part of that coalition but we can't depend on the idea that uh the white women are going to save us if you look across this country that's what we're seeing and that's where the future is\nWhat are you running on I mean when you're going out in this last month how are you getting people out to the polls what are you telling them\nYeah I said the two biggest issues one is check on Trump we've definitely got to send some people to Congress that are going to fight Trump right now with Republicans controlling the house and in the Senate or the you know they've got what ever they need to get whatever they want a it's\nTime that America puts a check on Trump and that's what we're messaging and people are responding to but it's not just about Trump's also about our vision for America and that's why you see campaigns that are running on a issues like Medicare for all inclusive populism really succeeding Beto O'Rourke has\nPut a Texas roaring digits between him right between Ted Cruz and the way he's been able to do that is because he was running a powerful people powered campaign on issues and a vision for America like Medicare for all\nCharles Chamberlain director of the liberal\nPacked democracy for America thank you thank you for having\n\n\n\nYou're listening to NPR News\nIt's great to
