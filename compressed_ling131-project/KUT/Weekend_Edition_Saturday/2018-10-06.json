a psychologist so I'm trying to work at how we can ... recall memory when people are reading particular select pop them takes you know a quotation a sentence or something and\nThe essence of what we've done is that we've actually submitted a kind of conventional reading at in my trading\nSupposedly ... which is a slant that runs counter to the new direction of the ... you know how\nI tell it usually run to the Roswell ... gene unconventional and then on top of that we have then made the parts of the litter form incomplete and what that basically does that kind of plays a slug trick on the mind which is of course the mind\nInstantly tries to resolve shapes result circles in diagnoses and so and so that actually slows down the prices of reading inside your brain and then um I can actually trigger memory\nSo if the ... faces both incomplete and uncommon that helps us remember\nYes that's and it's ... ... the uncommon aspect is very important because this is talk I came out of a lot of tasting in the in psychology labs and we really we tested as a\nFull spectrum of talks I said from the really familiar you are ... times and civil rights ... that we really might completely\nDisrupted really old and how to read and sent spaghetti ... was positioned pretty much in the middle of that spectrum so that it also did just enough\nUniqueness to recall memory but not

line every weekend leading up to the mid term we are here to guide you through what could move to vote this November\nI'm Scott Detrow this week the most divisive Supreme Court nomination in a generation had suicides about what I Will read Kavanaugh's confirmation battle have on the mid term\nAnd with President Trump saying men are being falsely accused across the country well Kavanaugh backlash from conservative men help Republicans draw even with Democrats in the desperate [noise]\nPlus a look at how the mid term result could change immigration [noise]\nAll of that and more after this news\nI have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision with her recognition of this solemn nature and the importance of the occasions\nYou listen to this speech forty plus minutes point by point a sales pitch for Brett Kavanaugh in terms of his background his judicial philosophy\nJudge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his twelve here track record as a judge including for his judicial temp for\nA really discounting Christine Blasey Ford another accusation stuff\nFor when and said she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the U.S all of her\nEven though ... said that but she wasn't trying to do that and she spoke in support of me too hard to listen to the speech and think that Susan Collins really ever was undecided\nIt's hard to disagree with you on that though I'm told she was talking to constituents and uh you know she was really was really mulling over over the past several weeks and she went out of her way to say how many times she had met with him how many hours she had spent talking to people about this\nI think the first part of her speech was a little bit of selling how hard it was for her to make the decision and then she transitioned to a closing argument for cabinet as\nNot a partisan he was made out to be and I think that that was the vast majority of what her speech was was explaining that he in her mind was not the partisan that Democrats have said he is at the beginning of her speech after she was shouted down by some protesters who had to be removed from the Senate gallery\nShe went on to say that she was disappointed that this wasn't a solemn and consideration of the Supreme Court nominee but it got her level political campaign\nAnd from there it was pretty clear from the start that she was building up her reasoning for voting gas\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR's Scott Detrow talking to ice Roscoe Kelsey Snell and Tim Mak Tim Ayesha what did you get out of the speech\nA couple of things jumped out to me firstly she she said she was really persuaded to support Kavanaugh actually after some of the allegations that were brought forward by Julie sweat neck and her lawyer Michael ... she said that those claims were outrageous and could not be corroborated\nShe also seemed almost put some salt in the wound of folks would hope that she would oppose Kavanaugh by saying the Kavanaugh actually\nYou know voted a lot with Merrick Garland you remember Merrick Garland the Obama nominee who never got a hearing in the Senate um those two things really jumped out at me and actually the whole speech if you read eighty Ninety percent of it on its own\nYou could almost imagine Mitch McConnell delivering a speech like that either\nTo me it was how long the speech was how and that's it was it didn't seem like this was like oh well I guess I'll vote yes but it's I'm very reluctant this was a full throated endorsement of him and when you talk about the way that she talked about a Christine Blasey Ford yeah\nUh she said that she believes that something happened to her but nevertheless she felt like it hadn't been corroborated ... and so it it was a way that I think that she was trying to thread the needle to say that we believe women they should be heard but uh\nShe's still raise questions about it well let's step back and talk about what we think that could mean from the mid term because you're right Collins says me to Israel it matters is long overdue but then she poked so many holes in what Ford said\nThat this is not a criminal trial but there's a there's basic fairness and and if you if you want to take allegations seriously they should at least meet a threshold of more likely than not indicating\nForge testimony was on the or not side\nWell I think this kind of lands on something that I've\nAnd hearing from Republicans for several days and we even her just kind of articulate this a little bit as he was doing his tour of bipartisanship with ah Chris Coons of Delaware let ... earlier this week\nThe fact of the matter is these Republicans are saying that they are conservatives that the judicial philosophy and the you know the entire background of having all fits with their political beliefs\nSo there's that one bucket of this conversation but then there's something separate happening here that is not specifically political that has to do with me too movement with the allegations\nOf sexual assault and sexual misconduct and they had to find a way to separate the two and make a vote about their political beliefs because at the end of the day they think their political beliefs or what is going to carry them through future elections\nSomething really remarkable here is that Kavanaugh's nomination him almost one year to the day from those initial articles about Harvey Weinstein that really kicked off\nThe me too movement and the the big question that I have is is is what's the lasting impact of this last week\nThis day long gut wrenching testimony now and and Christine Blasey Ford said that she was reluctant to come forward because she was worried it wouldn't matter in the end\nAnd now Brett Kavanaugh still goes to the Supreme Court anyway so what does that do what does that do for for women all across the country who are going through that who maybe had a similar experience in her life\nAnd and have a seamless combination of a year long national conversation about how we take allegations seriously or not\nI don't think that it ends here at all I don't think that it can and I think some people who supported Kavanaugh town and have kind of ... colon seem to argue he'll get on the court and everyone will kind of come together and everything will be better\nAnd I just I don't think that we see any evidence of that I think that the divisions in this country seems to be real and seemed to be hardening not\nYou know I I don't see him getting confirmed in all of these people who have been so passionate who've been protesting who've been talking about uh the sexual assault that they've been through I don't see that just fading away it seems like it would make people even more passionate\nIf we're talking about the energy that might come off of this event you can already feel it immediately after Joe Manchin a announced Hughes support for Brett Kavanaugh went outside in was confronted by a number of demonstrators who shouted him down as he tried to explain to\nThem than I\nAnd I went out Kelsey you and I cover Congress this is just been such a weird process I mean it started off thinking wow this\nIs going to be this ethic clash over the key swing vote then it became over the summer it seemed like kind of dug in terms of political interests than a done deal and then we spent the last month watching this visceral personal fight play out on national television and radio I mean what do you think you're going to take away from all this\nI Am going to be really watching the way senators recover from this if they recover from this because it's very likely that they're going to leave town fairly shortly here to go finished campaigning for the midterms which is the only let's gosh just a little bit more than a month away\nAnd once they leave they're going to go back into an even more partisan environment where they're running for reelection or supporting other people running for reelection\nAnd then they have to come back here and keep the government open and have a fight about President Trump's demand for a wall on the border with Mexico and I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly\nAnd are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or does this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nAnd and for me it it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust and the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court is justice partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer it's just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak thanks everybody thanks glad to be fine Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the week\n\nThis again is that people of color and these are we will never found out why and if\nThe way [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race over the country that speaks to a larger theme laying out and races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ... ... with us as well as the ... and Dominican so\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nHead of a sham that that he is an extremely qualified ... has been not given a fair shot and I think that's also what we're we're seeing and he and he's not the only one I mean you look\nAt like Erick Erickson who was one of those ... never Trump or conservative bloggers you look at his Twitter account now he is leading the fight when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid we're also seeing this set of coalescing amongst conservative men uh who may have had questions about President Trump itself but\nThe stewardess appointment has really galvanize them medical bro talk for a moment [laughter]\n[laughter] and when I have been in\nCan be part of all male conversations in a way that's awesome camp can't I mean is there something I think there is something to an undercover current feeling whether it's a grievance or not whether it's something that motivates a vote or not that made this increase to focus on on accusations of sexual assault of sexual harassment than a lot of men do feel\nIf not under siege than certainly uncomfortable and certainly reevaluating lots of things they dumped throughout their life that can be a positive thing and it can be a negative thing\nWell listen I mean I think Tim hit on the point that this is not just a grievance about immigration or a host of other issues this is also a grievance about how white men have felt that they feel like that they're guilty before proven innocent\nThis is a part of the backlash to the me too movement where I you know and I think a lot of women who I'd been talking to on the campaign trail strategist as well who felt like there was going to be a backlash that there was going to be something that came\nAfter the me too movement with men somehow being riled up for some of that\nAnd if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow with them in a ... awesome holiday and camera Keith and let's just look at the Judiciary Committee because for all of the similarities between Nineteen Ninety One and what happened the other week and there were a startling amount I think I'm\nThe Republican side continue to be all white men but on the Democratic side you had ... you had ... Mazie Hirono and the ranking the ranking member on the Democratic side Dianne Feinstein so you have seen a lot more diversity on the Democratic side at least but ...\nWhen it comes to gender when it comes to race when it comes to so many different things one group gaining power means another girl losing power and and there is a real backlash I think that's\nHow politics has often been seen though right is this sort of\nZero sum game like if one group gains another group is largely going to be disadvantaged and we've seen this time and again when it comes to issues around affirmative action right or immigration and indifferent sort of minority politics mission issues and we are seeing this now I I Would argue to some degree with conversations around\nGender and and again I think this is something that President Trump\nAnd very you could argue acutely very smartly politically smartly tapped into during the twenty sixteen election\nBecause it really galvanized people I mean I remember meeting\nA guy right actually the summer who was a huge Donald Trump supporter hadn't always voted Republican and instantly he started going into this frustration you had about safe spaces and how he feels like safe space and says it's silly idea you know he he ... he's a welder and gets burned all day he has cut why\nDo people need safe spaces and and this kind of talk I think gets that the frustration that some people have which is that like why do you need to be so politically correct and I know that we've talked a lot about what exactly political correctness means\nBut it's this frustration that they cannot say or behave the way that they had always said things are paved\nAbout one place where uh you can basically say whatever your feeling is conservative talk radio um and I've been listening to a lot of it recently and there is that very strong feeling of\nVictimization that men that white men are the victims in this um and you know Rush Limbaugh has been talking about so called send the Nazis for you know a generation almost two great commercial success\nBut he is doing it again in light of the cabinet hearing and in some ways this has is reflecting a viewpoint that is very much out there and it's not a current it's a it's a full on its occurred\nWas so out of balance here women activists feminine the women can demand all kinds of investigations into men men cannot require or demand investigations into women\nEven if we're talking a lot about the enthusiasm that we're seeing among men head of the midterms\nI I think we have to sort of put that in perspective which is that the enthusiasm we are seeing among women it's somewhat unprecedented I mean I have not heard or seen this level of enthusiasm for women and women are telling me you know they have\nNever done anything beyond vote before and in an election and now they're knocking on doors they're ... they're protesting they're going to march it's I mean there's an extreme level of engagement among women and so even though we're talking about what's happening\nI'm On the other side of the gender spectrum I think that it's it's not happening in a vacuum right it's also happening in contract and maybe you could argue because that some of the enthusiasm we're seeing from within\nAnd when we're talking about women here we're talking about democratic women\nAnd I mean that's an interesting point because there are a lot of Republican women frankly who are leading the charge on saying that they feel like their husbands or their sons are somehow being treated unfairly\nThis time and twenty sixteen we were talking about will you see this big shift of women voters to Hillary Clinton in response to President Trump's various scandals in statements and the answer was a pretty resounding no\nAnd it's true now too when we look at the polling that has not moved Republican women at all ...\nYou may go midterms are based elections typically and\nUntil recently one base was really super energize now both ... seem to be really super energize I guess one question is is this going to be a super ... on steroids base election and\nAnd the other question is does this fate is this like a boom of enthusiasm that you know if Republicans are the victors in this fight then maybe they fade out\nYou know look to us from his point about the fact that women are fired up women have been fired up this entire time right I mean since President Trump was elected women have been fired up and their levels were already polling very high so what this issue was able to do is\nEven though democratic enthusiasm ticked up slightly since the summer\nIt had a lot more room to grow for Republicans and Republicans have really struggled to find a single issue\nThat would fire up the base and this one seems to have done so and they were kind of surprised by that it does look like the at least the bet that Republicans are making is that this will be a base election because when you look at the enthusiasm numbers for Latinos for young people for independence groups that right now are leaning toward Democrats in our T\nCore constituency democratic groups for this election\nThose are much lower and if that's the case then we are headed for kind of a train crash of a of a culture war in at the ballot box in November of base election\nSo we're about a month to election day right\nIt's a very short amount of time but in the modern\nNew cycle that we live in a month is an eternity like five years [laughter] with Kavanaugh on his way to the Supreme Court do we think that that that may be Republican voters aren't so riled up because they got their guided gotten two Supreme Court justices that's old ... was a reason why a lot of Republicans voted for Donald Trump to begin with\nAnd they kind of fade away again or do we think this has staying power\nMaybe if you're talking about psychology um the emotion of anger\nAnd fear is much stronger than the emotion of happiness you are less likely to remember the things that you're happy about the things that you are bitter about that said we just don't know whether this is you know the python eats the rabbit and it moves through quickly and it's this big moment [laughter]\nOf energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of liquor python and\nAnger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid next everybody You're welcome You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed than to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about what is in\nBig deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right\nThe Congress passed an authorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complex for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room [noise]\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not giving you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also to ban so phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and to do for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "06"}
