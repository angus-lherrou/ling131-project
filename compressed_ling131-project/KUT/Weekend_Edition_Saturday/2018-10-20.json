A. and to ensure that the insurance markets work more properly and that we can lower premiums and deductibles for everyone but\nThe bottom line not let me ask ... does that mean you would vote against repeal\nIt means that I Would vote to replace the Affordable CARE Act with with measures that fix it um\nBut I mean if there was a vote to repeal you would vote no\nI'm a strictly on a on a on a vote of it\nWhere the choice before us which I don't think we would hypothetically have that's correct but I think it's important to recognize what the Democrats want to do and what they're real agenda is is the single payer scheme which would make it legal employer provided health insurance it would double our taxes\nAnd it would create a death spiral with debt and deficit ... into the future and every single country that has a nationalized system like this has an annual debates as to what they can afford to pay and what they will cover so these debates don't go away if you hand all the control over to the government\nI I'm sure Democrats would say or at least a lot of Democrats would say they certainly are in favor of a national health care system bath way but it's uh I Do have to move on to uh to the death of democracy so sure um what do you think of the Saudi explanation\nIt's a very lame a it's an outrage what they've done a they their actions have been deeply offensive I think to a Americans of regardless of political opinion here at home and I do think that um it's a very complicated issue for us\nUm we've got thirty seconds left complicated in in that the Saudis have so much money invested here\nNow and the complicated in that we have a the major regional a adversary in that part of the world is Iran and the Saudis are aligned with us against the Iranian or\nA exploits in the middle east and so this is what makes it very difficult but I think we have to speak plainly to the Saudis and tell them that this is going to change our relationship\nRepresentative John Faso of New York say thanks so much for being with us thank you my pleasure and on weekend edition Sunday tomorrow with loaded with thousands of Central American\nMigrants are trying to make their way to the United states will hear from reporter James Frederick talking to migrants who are stalled at the border of Guatemala and Mexico you can tune in tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\nImmigrant advocates along with the American civil liberties union and the bus drivers you can deliver two hundred thousand sign petitions to greyhound bus headquarters downtown Dallas on friday a stellar Chavez from member station ... reports the group is demanding\nCompanies stop allowing border patrol agents under their buses the question passengers about their citizenship gathered in\nDowntown Dallas park the protesters said greyhound has the right to refuse border patrol agents from boarding their ... without a warrant or probable cause\nThe campaign called transportation that deportation accuses customs and border patrol agents of violating passengers constitutional rights they asking if they prove their US citizenship in a speech to the crowd Texas Democrat ... says the practice is happening\nIn heavily Hispanic areas and be on border checkpoint\nGreyhound is doing something that they don't have\nThey're subjecting many of their past\nThey're subjecting a warrantless searches\nRacial profiling\nAfter a series of speeches to groups plot several blocks to greyhound headquarters carrying ... signed petitions Tricia Martina senior vice president for greyhound legal department spreading statement for the faint bleach\nCBP officers do not ask permission or\nDrivers save the passengers at rest sites and stuff that are legal\nMore protests are planned in the coming weeks for NPR News I'm Scott let's try that in Dallas\n[noise]\nOoh [noise] ooh\n[noise] ooh\n[noise] ooh\n\n\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nSupport comes from the ... museum presenting commence emotion the art of air typical Nick celebrating command she culture past and present do original paintings artifacts and interactive for all ages more at the story of Texas dot com Casey would\nLike to thank for following business farmhouse delivering Dr Kimberly ...

to know when they can return to their classrooms that's the panhandle tries to recover from hurricane Michael storm severely damaged more than half of the schools in Bay county and left them with no electricity or water for some old remains our foundation walls\nSteve moss is vice chairman of the bay county school board you joined us on the line from Panama City Mr marsh thanks so much for being with us\nThank you for having me what do you need now well\nThe educational needs of our students are still taking a back seat to just the humanitarian needs that they have just a basic food shelter clothing water and just the basic they lie\nYeah do you have anything resembling a timeline as to when you may reopen schools\nWe hope maybe mid November if you saw the devastation that is really an aggressive timeline because so many of our schools don't have power or running water or electricity or any of those Internet service any of those things you normally see a out of school we do want to make sure all of our seniors graduate\nOn time and that most of our students are able to promote next grade level\nTo start as soon as we can for sure\nMr most how do you handle the fact that I'm\nI'm sure a lot of students are are and families who have lost their homes and and they're staying with relatives or had to move to other places in to the districts most we're all mixed up by now\nIt really is and for most of our communities we have basically thirty six schools about twenty six thousand students in our school district and there are several cities within our county and within\nEach of those cities the school is often times the hub of that community especially for a lot of our students that school the only with the humidity but that want safe place that they could rely on because oftentimes the home life of our kids\nAs pretty rough and so we're trying the best we can to rebuild those communities\nRebuilding our schools as fast as we can but for a lot of our students it'll take years to get them back to where they were before the hurricane hit\n[noise] do you have any schools that escaped damage or or or at least having been hurt so badly that you can't use them\nWe have between six to twelve of that argues ... here's the dilemma we're coming up with the schools that are severely damaged we can't use\n'cause they don't have power electricity the schools that were damaged or not they use that shelters for the time being and and maybe for the foreseeable future\nInstruments I gather that despite or maybe even because of the considerable losses you've had challenges you have um they're still going to be a football game Saturday Night\n[laughter] yes there will Scott and I have a feeling they'll be a lot of folks there that are sports fans but they're coming there just\nIt's a way for our community to come together through of all things the football game\nOh that sounds nice do you have a cheer you can share with is\nWhat the team that's playing out mostly dolphins yeah of all things and so the ban will be there playing the fight all\nCheerleaders ... and we're trying to have it look as much as a regular football game would be a even though we understand that a lot of athletes that will be flight or living in shelters and do not have a hope to return to after the game but but a lot of our student athletes their extended family is their cheat\nAnd so it'd be a way for them to reconnect with their teammates and their extended family on the football field\nI don't get a vote but go dolphins\n[laughter] outweigh the absolutely

D. one often it's nine o'clock [noise]\nPolitics you from NPR we're about two weeks away from\nThe mid term election but\nWays to get out and vote in November\n... there are four hundred thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the line and every weekend leading up to election day worst year with special broadcast to guide you through all the news that could alter the vote this November\nThis week the state as well have a deep dive into the contested races in the country in the Justice Department charges a Russian woman with interfering in the mid term election it's the first such charge we seen the campaigns\nAnd how when it's most rising she's in the country climate change is motivating those public and to talk about deregulation Democrats warn of an environmental crisis\nAll that and more after the news\nBut there is an interesting test case of how Republicans deal with President Trump remember early on he was a critic of President Trump during the twenty sixteen campaign\nHe was a key no vote or threaten vote I should say when when it came to trying to repeal Obamacare\nHe famously held up that process had a big press conference in Nevada where he said I Can't vote for this bill then he changed course ended up supporting the repeal effort and then became a pretty close ally of President Trump who's made repeated visits here uh he'll be here again this weekend\nAnd Trump was joking during his last rally that Hillary and he didn't get along before now they get along fine so the questions I have is how to Republican voters respond to that we've seen time and time again that Republicans had been punished by their base for opposing President Trump\nIs everything good with Heller up Republican voters\nAnd does that back and forth a hurt him with Democrats and independents\nThe big thing in this this is really one of three democratic targets and the best one that Democrats have a shot at to Hillary Clinton won here that just shows you how narrow the landscape is for Democrats to try to\nEven never my pick up seats but to hold what they're what they've got and my other big question is what Latino too because Latinos in the southwest not just in Nevada but in Texas and Arizona and in the mid term is more broadly you know really could put Democrats over the edge or hold them back\nGiving you were just talking about Latino voters and turn out and that makes me think of another really interesting Senate race that Arizona I Would say Democrats saw Arizona and continue to see Arizona as a possible shortcuts opportunity for them in part because if you look at twenty sixteen democratic pretty well I mean Hillary Clinton I think\nLast estate by less than four percent I mean that was way closer than a traditional swing state like Ohio\nAnd and one of the things that's been interesting to me though about Arizona is it really sort of demographically a state that people think should in theory benefit Democrats but it speaks to the exact same problem you've been talking about which is where the voters in the Democratic party our ears notice any states where\nYou know a demographers will describe it as having kind of the widest cultural age gap they say which means that basically like the divide between your older population and your younger population it's huge one of the stark is in the entire\nCountry you have a lot of retirees light of new people coming into the largely\nDrought or other folks have color and and one of the big question does okay find that might be changing the population but at those people are young and they're often folks that color and they don't necessarily always show up in the mid\nTerm and disconnected from the system and just from party politics\nAll right if you're just joining us this is the politics show from NPR unless my call in and I'm here with NPR's Scott Detrow Mara Liasson and diminish ...\nEven though we've been talking about key races in the Senate this cycle that talks about what race you are watching\nYou know I've been looking at been surprised by the fact that in Montana and Indiana\nThe Democrats there have seem pretty resilient and you know we're talking about John tester who has the buzz cut hair cut by the way he's running against the guy who's got the same buzz cut hairdo you can go look that up if you don't mind about Montana that look I don't know what it is but apparently that's how you show your real Montana and um [laughter]\nBut to show your real Hoosier as I Know that you're yeah shit I appreciate and value in because you're Hoosier yourself\nUm you know the the candidate who's running there who's a democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly and he's in this red state that President Trump won by a lot he's running against a businessman this guy named Mike Braun and you know Donald has been holding up Republicans have been surprised\nRise to the ... it's like I look around and some of the chatter I heard from base democratic voters with a lot of skepticism about ... I think they that they that he certainly got some street cred within the local Democratic Party when he decided to vote against Kevin\nAnd I think that you know this is a guy who\nSome independence in a lot of ways in that way in one but let's listen to one of his TV ads and I think you'll see why it sounds a whole lot different than some of the other Democrats across the country more\nRadical who wants to eliminate my support on Monday President Trump's border wall extremes on the left and right I Want to cut defense spending I don't want our troops and verify\nListen to that he says he supports the eyes he said that he supports President Trump's border wall how many Democrats across the country would say that that raise my eyebrows any quotes Ronald Reagan said he believes in peace through strength he also said no socialized medicine and know cutting the Affordable CARE Act now that's a line to walk\nThat's right there's not a lot of time last before election day and I knew that we've all been talking about the ups and downs in this race but Scott what's the civically are you looking for between now\nAnd November six that you think maybe could give us somewhat of a clue about what will happen I lecture today\nWell one of the one of the biggest things that we saw this week was just the insane amount of money that democratic candidates have had brought in house candidates all over the country bringing in\n... the the type of money that sometimes you see Senate can candidates bringing Senate candidates in beta Iraq's case bringing in presidential campaign level numbers there is just a ton of donor enthusiasm on the Democratic side the candidates have a ton of money\nIt's my question is what are they going to do with it at a certain point you can't buy more TV ads all the TV Time is taken up\nSo how do they use this money do they use it on on door knocking on get out the vote efforts do they use it on digital advertising I'm just really curious to see where that money goes and how they can leverage that advantage that they have because again the the divide between the party and fundraising was was really striking\nAnd also can they spend it in a way that lays down some permanent infrastructure for Democrats in states where they haven't had much of one\nYeah given to get to hear something that you really watching these last couple of weeks [noise]\nOkay look the fact is you're now starting to hear that turned out in this election could be a record could be as high as it's been since the mid Nineteen sixties another time of social and cultural upheaval I talked to Michael McDonald who's\nThe turnout expert at the University of Florida keeps a big turnout database that everybody looks at ... and he said that he's looking at essentially for a markers for indicators for why he thinks that turned out to going to be that high for mid term okay\nShe said that there was record special election turnout hype primary turnout a high degree of self reported interest in the election and high levels of early voting and we're seeing intensity and all of those metrics absolutely and he said when all four of those are pointing in one direction he said you know look it just seems to point\nTo the fact that this is this could be an election that is higher turnout than most people have seen in their lifetimes from ...\nAnd we should explain that even higher turnout and it may mean somewhere between forty five fifty percent of the electorate voting admire you watch\nI'm watching the immigration debate\nI think that now that the Brett Kavanaugh moment has come and gone I'm not saying it didn't help Republicans get more energized but I Do think that Donald Trump is looking for another culture war issue that he can use to energize his base that's fascinating the caravan of\nPeople coming through Mexico from Central America on ... potentially on their way to the U.S border is something that he's been tweeting about I think that what we've seen is when the immigration debate focuses on border security\nOr abolishing ice than Republicans when when the immigration debate focuses on taking kids away from their parents Democrats win so I'm watching that a caravan of potential immigrants to the U.S and seeing if it's going to blow up into a big issue before election\nDay that's really interesting and it's also an issue that I think makes Donald Trump feel very comfortable right like this is what he ran on\nWell he's a culture warrior and immigration was his number one issue he wrote down the gold escalator and said Mexico was sending rapists do the United states\nImmigration is the one thing over the past decade that has fired up Republicans almost more than anything else including the Supreme Court [noise] All right that was NPR's Scott Detrow ... and Mara Liasson thank you all thank you You're welcome\n[noise]\nThis is a policy of show from NPR I must smile and it feels like every week there is wide and major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories I can\nGet over ... ... we dive into Wednesday to sneak they did not get a lot of attention and could do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as white\nHouse counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise in white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of the sea is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House down again is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... below me\nWho is well known in Republican legal circles but while civil Loni is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nIf you like as I'm listening to describe all of the some of this feels Harry insider eight to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWhich is a signal in a sense of how important they take this issue right now and how much of a concern it is and how they kind of want to put a public concerns at ease a let people know that they are addressing this threat they have it on the radar\nAnd they're trying to deal with it one of the things that they talk about his is foreign influence campaigns we've talked a lot about um the ones that the Russians are conducting they also say that China and other foreign actors are doing these sorts of influence operations as well certainly what were we talked about most is Russia because they have been the most effective uh as far as we know publicly\nA lot of what these sorts of campaigns intel is what we've talked about social media a fake news\nFacebook accounts that are trying to sow discord in that sort of stuff that they're keeping an eye out for what they don't talk about is any hacking at this point that we know directed at twenty Eighteen midterms are like we saw on twenty sixteen with the hacking of the Clinton campaign and then the weaponization of those are those emails the\nMessage of the government tried to send on friday was that voting machines they believe are safe so if you punch card on a ballot or if you use the voting machine the vote will be recorded\nFaithfully they haven't recorded any cyberattacks against those types of systems but the campaign that Ryan just talked about the ones that involve the public information space on line in the way we relate to other Americans on social media\nThat's the biggest concern that the spy agency's talked about this sort of\nInformation warfare right that you're describing and it sounds like that is the this sort of intervention that we're seeing at this point ahead of the twenty Eighteen elections but how does this compare it gets to what we saw the\nUp to twenty sixteen well earlier this summer and actually just a couple of weeks ago we heard from some of the leaders of the national security\nEstablishment would director of national intelligence Dan Coats up your director Christopher Wray\nUm even the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein have talked about the level of activity that we've seen from foreign actors trying to influence the voting what they said in in the case of Russia in particular is that yes the Russians are active\nIt's not the same level as we saw in the run up to twenty sixteen but that doesn't mean that they can flip the switch and suddenly we're going to see a whole different level and just go just let the church\nOne of the more interesting things to me is that once again and these criminal charges we saw against the Russian woman on friday there is no allegation that any Americans were conspiring or we're reading a collaborators in this information warfare campaign\nThat the Russians once again are successfully exploiting divisions within American society and doing it very very effectively in a way that troubles not just the intelligence community but all sorts of political leaders around the country\nIt's worth adding on that very important point that they are not creating divisions they are exacerbating divisions are already exist\nYet I mean you mentioned some of this is like around gun control immigration these are cultural fishers Alice as a political reporter we've gotten the country we hear consistently from voters about these things but it sounds like you're saying they are just taking this and intensifying it in ... in the social media face it\nAbsolutely and some of the documents reference and that these court challenges from friday talk about witch hunts and making fun of Iraq Obama making fun of the late ... Arizona Senator John McCain targeting politicians on both sides of the aisle for some of these kinds of rhetoric we've been hearing in political ads here in the U.S over time\nAnd even things like the NFL protest anthem protests\nInteresting if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I must have a holiday and I'm here in the studio with NPR's Carrie Johnson Ryan Lucas and Phil Ewing\nFeel a sense of and now that we know\nThat this is happening at least in the the information face um what the U.S officials are doing and is this something that we've been you think of the country successfully able to combat that far when we're talking about the administration's response\nThe government says that it wants to make the public aware about this as much as possible the FBI has launched a special website That's focused on public information campaigns the director of national intelligence Dan Coats other people at his level talk about this publicly much more than they used to\nBut the fact that are made clear in these court documents shows how much this continues to take place on social media on Facebook and Twitter especially and frankly what a bad job those two platforms have done\nIn scrapping these sorts of things these court papers are filled with examples of Russian influence mongers creating fake accounts pretending to be Americans and posting\nMeans about president ... the former president his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are ostensibly or the coverage of the Austin bombings that took place last year and how much\nThe media was ignoring them because the victims weren't white because they were black and Latino at the time and these as Ryan indicated are American controversy is taking place naturally in our own context but the Russians are very skilled on social media and getting in there and trying to turn up the volume as much as they can so skilled\nThere's actually some instructions quoted in these court papers in this part of this Russian Campaign they're telling Russians listen if you want to target American liberals don't mention the site Breitbart and if you want to target American conservatives steer clear of mentioning buzzfeed and I\nDon't know what they're doing [laughter] it's a little bit about what the social media platforms themselves are doing with these tech giants are doing I Know our colleague Tim Mak\nDid spend some time at with Facebook just this past week and Facebook is sort of counting this election security war room that they've developed but I'm curious if any of you have a sense of\nHow successful this has been because to some degree also you know the Russians and whoever it is is trying to interfere could ... just invent new tricks\nWhat the platform so focused on his transparency so they're responding and the way that uh the American political system has historically a to campaign influence issues where if you buy an ad that says Obama is a part of the Muslim Brotherhood\nFacebook once you'd have to disclose who you are and thereby disclose the origins of that type of messaging so that will be in place for political campaigns going forward but in real time when you're scrolling through your Facebook feed\nWho's actually going to look at that and do the research and say oh this appears to be a foreign influence campaign if it's going to have an effect it's not going to stop the problem and it's not going to keep our information environment in the United states pristine in any way\nOn a slightly depressing to one of the questions that I always like to ask a Social Security people when I when I meet with him and talk to them as are these sorts of operations is this just the sort of world that we live in now and\nReally there's no way to to and there is no way to combat those to the point where it's not going to be an issue and the depression answer that I generally get is is is pretty much the world we live enough\nJust to get constantly playing defense you can never really entirely fix the problem right you're just sort of trying to to blockade is that sort of ... yeah that's a good example of looking\nAt the dilemma that counterterrorism professionals have talked about for many years because we have an open society we have freedom of movement we have freedom of speech you can go wherever you want within reason and in the old days we worried about terrorists exploiting that these days we're worried about foreign governments exporting that because they can move much more quickly than Facebook and Twitter can to clamp down on them\nAnd I'm the U.S government really has no way to stop that from taking place\nI got to tell you that if somebody who sometimes goes out in the world to speak at places other than Washington DC I Know that we have listeners who I teach high school and college history or American studies or social studies\nAnd at the high school and the college level\nThey are trying to educate people young people about how to recognize some of these phony mediums and information warfare attacks to try to get out the problem that way before people start logging into Facebook and believing what everything that they read there's actually a real\nKind of effort it civics education out they're aimed at young folks to try to get them to recognize these things that are targeting them everywhere they go\nOh that's wonderful but it's also it's like a generational struggle that's it's going to take years and years to get an educated voting populace that's conscious of such things\nJust to kind of wrap up the conversation here it sounds like the interference that we are seeing is is really just essentially on the information level the information and public face but it it's not really a matter of voting like if if I Am a vote are we going to vote is not a real threat to election security and that way it is that right\nAccording to what these national security agency set on friday they haven't identified any cyberattack that is going to result in a vote being changed so if you go to the polls and you try to vote for your member of Congress what the government is saying if they don't have any evidence that but will not be counted as you intended\nThese interference campaigns focus on the public information space and United States on social media especially and they're attempting to change Americans behavior by the information they take in and the way they think as opposed to the actual way the votes are collected accounting\nThat's NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing thank you all for much thank you thank you All right well we're going to switch gears because now it's time for race of the week [noise]\nGet these people need your help we will
