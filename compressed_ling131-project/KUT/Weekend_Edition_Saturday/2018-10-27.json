put it aside until events of yesterday\n[noise] NPR security correspondent Greg Myre thanks so much for being with us thank you Scott we're going to turn to NPR's Ron Elving Ron thanks so much for being with us\nGood to be with he's got a first let me ask you about President Trump's reaction of these events because at the White House yesterday he said quote we must show the world that we're not together in peace and love\nAnd harmony as fellow American citizens uh then just hours later a rally in North Carolina uh he hadn't yet another line of attack and\nYes and you know even at the White House event that you mentioned he said those words about peace and love and then he took off after CNN and others and to me you know\nAnd got the crowd chanting lock them up lock them up there's a pattern of the president first saying the magnanimous and presidential thing possibly reading from prepared remarks that may be on the teleprompter than pivoting to the spontaneous remarks that are his trademark\nSo again last night at that rally in North Carolina he began with this\nViolence was never\nEver be allowed in America and I will do everything\nIn my power to stop it and it another way he talked about ending what he called the politics of personal destruction but moments later he was backed debating the crowd with the name of Maxine Waters and outspoken African American congresswoman\nAnd teasing the crowd before saying I won't say it um I I won't say it's not clear what it was but in the past he has referred to Maxine Waters as a quote very low IQ person I I Want them to say I was being nice the president said\nTo laughter from the crowd and Democrats of course have um a level the charge that President Trump has ... helped to create this politically charged atmosphere\nThe president told reporters yesterday that that certainly his rhetoric couldn't uh couldn't be held responsible for what ever happened to put all these mail bombs are addressed to Democrats in some of his critics\nThat raises the question how much can President Trump be held responsible for the actions of this one apparently troubled math\nCertainly not responsible in a legal sense or responsible in a literal sense but everyone should have a look at these rallies\nOr ask themselves what the under tones and underlying purpose of these rallies might be and consider the photographs now circulating of the bombing suspect himself attending one of these rallies and holding one of these signs\nUm other news we need to ask you about President Trump continued to talk about the caravan of thousands of Central Americans who are traveling through Mexico\nTo try to reach the U.S border there are reports this week the president's considering executive action that would block them from applying for asylum um do we need to consider the timing when we talk about this\nYes everything right now is about the mid term elections in ten days this this caravan had swollen to more than seven thousand early in the week yesterday it was down to roughly half of that size or less many are dropping out the Mexican government is offering incentives for those who would choose to stay in the southern part of Mexico and that's an offer me\nMaybe pretty tempting for many of these people to accept while others are going to press on to the United states and if they get to the border\nThey will represent some marginal increasing the number who seek asylum at that border every month but the images and projections of an army of migrants marching across Mexico descending on America and that was never the real story and it becomes less like reality everyday ten days from the mid\nTerm just looked as if polls have been tightening a now maybe Democrats have extended a lead according to ah the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll\nIt looked like ten points in the generic poll which party do you want to have in control of the house so that's the threshold of a truly meaningful margin if it holds it would seem sufficient to deliver the house to the Democrats it would not appear nearly sufficient to deliver the Senate but it would suggest the momentum shift we felt earlier in October toward the president and his party\nHas begun to shipped back in the direction of the opposition\nNPR's Ron Elving thanks so much thank you Scott\nTheodore Roosevelt coined a phrase when he

atmosphere\nI Wish we could stop there but we can't fix the truth is there is so much viciousness on either side on both sides\nThat people don't really listen anymore to anyone but the people who agree with them and frankly the people who grew with them a enthusiastically that's a very dangerous thing it's not the most divided we've ever been we had a civil war after all\nA but it's a very dangerous moment in a moment when what we should be looking for on the national stage or the voices of calm and rationality\n... let me ask you about the history of this because uh of course you mentioned the civil war I won't even try and make that argument\nBut in in in the Nineteen sixties you had the assassinations of Dr\nKing and Robert F Kennedy a you had the bombing of the weather

are we are a little more than one week away from the mid term election\nGoing to get out and vote in November\nDo every Wednesday or four hundred and thirty five thousand thirty five Senate seats on the line every weekend leading up to election day we are here with a special broadcast to guide you through all the news that could affect the vote this November\nI'm Scott Detrow it's been another week of dramatic headlines about a new poll from NPR and its partners\nShows the midterms have reverted back to the same dynamic that have been driving the race all year\nDemocrats are talking a lot about health care and Republicans are pushing back\nWe'll take a close look at what exactly Congress and the Trump Administration did to change the Affordable care\nAll that and more after the news live from NPR News in Washington I'm neuron\nSo so election days about a week and a half out at this point all of us have been covering the midterms in one way or another for for almost two years now at this point we've all\nBeen on the road and a lot of these districts let's just take a moment to walk through some of the big themes that we've been seeing all along in terms of what voters are thinking in terms of what campaigns are looking at it or who the candidates are\nBut a lot of these races are taking place in suburban districts so you know first and foremost you have to start there when you look at the twenty five seats for example that Hillary Clinton\nWon in twenty sixteen but have Republicans representing them in on the congressional level a lot of those places happened to be in suburban areas like outside Los Angeles Kansas City Philadelphia a Dallas those are places where you're seeing a lot of these races play out\nYou're also seeing women be a big part of the few of fueling the opposition to President Trump suburban women for example when who live in the suburbs have a much lower approval rating of President Trump than others\nBut this is where I Would jump in and get on my high horse about that phrase suburban voters especially suburban women voters because it's kind of euphemism that we use in political reporting it's not that like\nLiving in a medium density area outside of a city ... that's not terribly walkable naturally\nMakes you more democratic or Republican or more swinging events so who's specifically we're really talking about that so I asked a few pollsters earlier this year about this and they said you know listen often when we are when we sort of talk about this we're often talking about white college educated or otherwise affluence because she thinks tend to go hand in hand\nVoters that's that's a lot of it to be honest and there's a nurse or another cultural associations people tend to put suburbs right you know like\nPerhaps married parents white picket fence all of that stuff and those are people who by the way are relatively likely to vote and we pay a lot of attention because\nRecently those college educated white men and white women have swung more towards the Democratic party and that was even before President Trump a set up that shift yes and that ship has been happening among both white college educated men are roughly split evenly at this point white college educated women have swung way hard towards the Democrats\nAnd the district I'm I'm really interested in is California's forty eight which is in orange county it's a suburb of Los Angeles you've got this a congressman named Dana Rohrabacher he's been in office he was first elected Thirty years ago in the eighties and he's a surfer\nLast campaign has hit with a some sort of uh what's the age of ... around and\nI just sit around the ... watching him and his suit\nMost people don't know him as a server they know him as as the Republican that is perhaps the most pro Clinton pro Russia congressmen in Washington DC his district was actually one by Hillary Clinton by two points in twenty sixteen he's being challenged by a local businessmen so it's one of those key races in Los Angeles suburb that will show us whether this trend is\nDefinitive the local business and used to be a Republican himself right and so like there he may arguably have some bipartisan appeal\nRight and polls show that race is super close if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're focusing on the race for the house of representatives with NPR's Dominican months' narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak\nThe minute ... take me to the future of you and I sitting in the studio and election night where the cabs have your browser will be open to\nYou know I'm old school I don't even have the browsers I use paper and I've got my list here or that and because I'm political editor I Am going to take some liberty\nZoom out and grab a bunch of races in one big bucket on the on the Internet on it and everybody settling here we go this is the Obama Trump districts okay from Trump right these are districts that President Obama won in twenty twelve but\nPresident Trump wound up winning and twenty sixteen not gonna talk about all these races but I Want to talk about where they are because it's really indicative of how well Trump did and uh\nWhat Democrats need to do to win a house or on election day or for Republicans to hold it most of these places are either in the mid west and if you look at at all of them globally there in New York and New Jersey is the Philadelphia suburbs\nAre all the way up through upstate New York a lot of these districts there's one that's uh just outside St Louis on the Illinois size\nYou look at all of those places and I to me you know if Democrats can do well in the half a dozen or so tossup races that are within this Obama Trump bucket then they probably take back the house\nFun fact three out of four Iowa districts therefore Iowa districts three of them were Obama Trump districts and two of them are pretty close tossup races right now\nA part of that might have to do with the even this of redistricting but that's a conversation for another time to put us out\nFor Iowa out there that's off a I'm going to go with Amy McGrath in Kentucky sixth district she is running against Andy Barr he a as a Republican of course a Democrat\nOr not this is a district that has been pretty hard core Republican Trump won it by Fifteen points at any McGrath is a marine veteran and she is one also one of those democratic women candidates that has gained a lot of prominence on the national stage\nOne of many uh one of many women veterans running on the Democratic side this time\nYes absolutely I mean we have quite a few ... at least historically speaking women combat that's running for Congress she raised three times of India are dead and the third quarter the fear and part of what I'm watching it's first of all if she can flip this kind of a district that's really stunning\nBut I'm also watching a lot of these combat that's because what we do know from pulling it is that voters tend to give women and democratic women perhaps especially\n... much less of an edge on things like national security and so on as they might give her Republican man and so this is sort of a test case for that\nSo we've been saying all along that the Democrats are feeling confident that they can take control of the house but of course we don't know what's going to happen on election day we've talked before on the show about the legislative stakes what could Congress do\nNext year depending on who's in charge whatever the political stakes what does it mean to the Democratic party if it at the end of the day they don't retake control the house and for the second election cycle in a row they've they've missed their mark and and and they've lost\nIt'd be an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right now there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party is in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house then they're going they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership\nWill be and Tim take the flip side of that if Republicans somehow keep control of the house of representatives Republicans talking about the next day well\nThe president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh and and on the left if there's going to be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with the Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost and twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened during this election\nWe know one thing is for sure if Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes are going to be stepping on the gas or an exclamation point\nNPR's the minute come on to narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking You're welcome in Dominican stick with us because now it is time for race of the week\nRunning for United States Senate\nAnd these are we will never down by and if\n\nEvery week we focus on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia and the minute ... you're still with me how's it going hey they're working to bring in\nJohnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello so Dominique oh let's start with you who the candidates\nAnd the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black female governor and the race really is statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin Abrams have sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer\nMore specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases and the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nIs this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams and to the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as complex to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular race has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties or the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nThat we weren't sure exactly what to make about the numbers last time around was that Kavanaugh had just happened but also the election was getting close and the Republicans were tuning in and getting enthusiastic\nBut then you know you were saying the fact is Democrats had been more than ... since the moment Donald Trump was elected president right I Do not on election day when Donald Trump was being elected president\nLast January you you saw this massive women with these pink hats on down I heard they were they were around I don't know but that was a sign that Democrats were at an eleven from the very start when we were barely starting to think of that term is back in January twenty Seventeen from the moment Donald Trump was inaugurated\nDemocrats have been angry and it you know there have been active is organizing so when we talk about Republican enthusiasm ramping up before the election\nAbsolutely happens all the time what sets this year apart it's first of all both parties are super enthusiastic but Democrats have been there this whole time and Republicans have sort of caught up to them\nAnd I think what's important about that is that beneath that a top line number of the enthusiasm are the kinds of groups and people that could turn out to vote and what we're seeing is that independents who have been fighting with Democrats on a lot of these issues are are\nAt a higher enthusiasm level than they have been in past year some seven and ten a independent say that they think these elections are very important are seeing higher levels from voters Eighteen to twenty nine now they're not as high as some of these core Republican groups but those court republic\nGroups are expected to be there so this was a national all we did not go district by district asking about specific candidates but we did ask that general question of\nWould you rather vote for a Democrat or Republican House what did we find\nWe did and the Democratic advantage on that question increased from six to ten points just in the past month\nAnd that's an important number because that double digit ... what we called generic ballot gap is a significant one when a strategist look at that when pollsters look at that\nThey see that as a fundamental a thing Democrats or fifty percent Republicans are at forty percent and that really tells you the story of a who has the advantage here and you know again we're not talking about the Senate and whether or not Democrats can take the Senate because it's they're being run in such red states\nBut when you look at the suburbs and you look at where these house races are being run that's for Democrats advantages\nI Would have back up and look at the generic ballot issue again because one thing once again this is where the gender gap pops up and the biggest way among independents so when you look at Democrats Ninety seven percent of democratic women say they're going to vote democratic zero percent zero day they are going to vote Republican\nYou can just tell you that you know how often push polling exactly what you do not see the number zero\nZero zero percent of democratic with it so that surprised me but\nGetting to what's important nine and ten Republican men and women say yeah I'm going to vote Republican independence independent men prefer the Republican by two percentage points which is to say roughly evenly split independent women prefer the Democrats by twenty three percentage points so once again when you're looking at the gender gap that is where it's\nGoing to ... and I look at unmarried women look at white college educated women they are really driving a lot of this election and the opposition to President Trump last question on this uh what\nWere the issues that that voters seem to be most motivated by well\nYou know the one saving grace for President Trump here is that the economy and jobs continue to rate as the top issue for a for people now it's not a huge percentage of people but it's it's the largest number of what's asked here and when you look at a second is healthcare third is immigration\nBut the divide between the parties are two completely different universes that rise to party flipping Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves with healthcare ads they're running healthcare healthcare healthcare everywhere\nDemocrats believe that's the top issue followed by the way by climate change Republicans see jobs in the economy has topped with immigration as not too far behind which explains President Trump's attempts at trying to wrap up the base and talking about immigration and this caravan coming from\nCentral America and funny you should mention that because later in the show Danielle and I will have a long conversation about health care with NPR's Scott Horsley looking at how it's played out of the campaign but more importantly what the actual\nVotes have done or would have done and what the Trump Administration has done on Obamacare as later on the show\nRight Danielle Kurtzleben ... thank you so much and you You're welcome [noise]\nVisit the politics you from NPR I'm Scott Detrow feels like there's always a few major stories that dominate the headlines\nOne person is now in federal custody after a nationwide bomb scare\nThe tunneling international outrage over the killing of a Washington Post columnist has the Trump Administration\nOn that end of the United states calling a growing caravan of Central American migrants a national\nEmergency and because of that other really important stories often get overlooked so every week we take a few minutes to focus in on one story that didn't get that much attention this week\nTo do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with who's got some it's everything else that happened this week President Trump signed sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become the worst health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think\nOf another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same a reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether and we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible problem\nSo what are some specific things that this law does\nOne of the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge has been access to Medicaid coverage\nWhich was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addictions\nBacks the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and many doctors appear to be getting\nThe message on this uh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies\nAdditional measures including new enforcement strength for the United States Postal service so that they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who\nStruggled with opioid this bill us it signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling off\nYes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nData for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate\nThat the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years he used the word plateau and that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year and twenty
