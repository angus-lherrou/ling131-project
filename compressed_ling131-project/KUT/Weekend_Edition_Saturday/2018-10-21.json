right that's the thing have discovered more of her works previously unknown works that show how she became one of the pioneers of confessional poetry to colleagues ... of the University of Idaho and Aaron singer from Louisiana Tech or the scholars who found the Fort poems along with an essay\nAnd Aaron single joins me now she's an assistant professor of English at Louisiana Tech University Welcome thanks for having me so you found these works along with your colleague Zachary Turpin\nAnd when was the moment that you realize oh no one's seen these before\nWell that looked at them and said you know these look like sex then but they don't look like the facts and I've read\nSo even from the beginning we had a very clear idea that we might have found something special here so the next step but to reach out to other more established ... scholars who hadn't seen them and that was when we got really excited\nThey put us in touch with her daughter and literary executor and then to great effect then who also that I I've never seen these either\nSo sexed and as we said it's one of the poets really introduced the idea of confessional poetry poetry that's personal so much about the I how do these pumps fit into that emerging style well\nI think one of my favorite things about back then it how she kind of emerges ah almost fully formed right\nSo she she wasn't on a childhood poetry writer you know before she even started taking a poetry class where she's writing for therapy twelve years after that she's winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry and said I'm going to be on the show is yes her developments but also very much her initial poetic power\nIn Nineteen fifty seven sheep present her mother with a sort of homemade book upon and she said this was the first year and next and you know ... and not before she even start publishing and then very shortly after I had a meteoric rise to fame\nSo I guess I'd like to know what these poems are about and something that really moved you can you give us an example\n[noise] in some ways they're almost a young person on some of them\nThe things that I really like is her gestures toward a image and metaphor that really shape her whole career so there's this line that particularly moves and they\nSay I am the air I break or say I am a rule unwinding I Am the school that unwound while riding the sky down a and I just

her book to demonstrate glued me known to prepare\nShe says something simple hotter boiling water allows us to do more good looking to realign getting into the habit of putting a pot of water on the stove\nAnd turning the heat under high and sending it to boil as soon as you walk in your door is one of the most empowering and useful things that you can do\nAs somebody who's not really comfortable cooking and the reason for that is because when you have water boiling and you can season it with salt and taste it until it tastes good and then you actually have a cooking medium that tastes delicious already ready to have anything at all put into it\nIt sounds so obvious but it's a very different emotional and intellectual experience to put a pot of water on well almost as though you're a natural cook and then look for something to put in it which makes you a master of boiling and an intuitive cook\nAnd so that is the advice that I guess people who think of themselves as non cooks and get yourself\nIn the middle of cooking a meal in a way that you wouldn't do because you don't have the confidence to say oh I'm the kind of person could just walk into my kitchen and start cooking 'cause if you start boiling water you actually are that person and it is what you're doing\nTomorrow Adler cooks using every little bit of food brought into her kitchen onions skins and partially stems become flavoring for chicken stock or beans in last night's leftovers become the foundation of tonight's dinner she credits her mother for some of her attitudes about food cooking and eating she worked\nEspecially want to have jobs and she cooks dinner every night and much every day but the way she did it was one day we would have rice with lentils on top of the next day we would have\nA kind of very or be fried rice and\nLentil kicks you know it went on like this she made it work and it was always really delicious there was that and then it's funny it was before I was writing my proposal and I was just writing odds and ends of articles and teaching poetry I I was trying to money and I really just\nBecame more frugal and scrupulous about my purchasing and my resourceful\nMess than I have ever been and there were things that I taught myself you know I Would make several meals out of the bones that I Would take home from the butcher classes that I talk 'cause I'm students didn't want to take home their chicken carcasses and their\nLamb legs without meat on them so I Would take them home and the small amounts of me would turn into a whole meals there are some things that I kind of suspected and imagine would really work and would make life still feel rich and wonderful and I was right\nShe says feeding yourself and your family with local and organic food on a budget is doable provided of course you aren't resourceful\nThere are specific cooking techniques that make it more doable and when you are trying to feed a lot of people and also have the priority of wanting to buy local buy organic by whole things there's not\nWith just deciding that cooking thinks you're going to use I'm going to be the ones that you the best and that's one of the reasons I boil a chicken ... it's like I can grilled chicken but I wouldn't get chicken pox without chicken broth I don't have the beginning\nOf soup or the only important ingredient other than rice ever sent to the same goes for vegetables one of the reasons that I roast them is that\nYou end up with this delicious the flavored olive oil when you're done resting and try and vegetables and that oh well it's a delicious spread for little Christine ... it doesn't sound like little Christina or something that help his family\nBut my mother that was a way that she quieted down for dinner\nIt's I think that there are actually techniques like resting boiling eyes I Will not to steamed vegetables because you don't end up with the delicious vegetable cooking that good and there's nothing wrong with saying\nI'm going to buy good vegetables and I'm going to insist cook them in the way that he ... the most usable ingredients at the end of that cooking demar Adler\nAuthor of another lasting meal and

they make and the\nThis morning at nine thirty five on K U T Ninety points on it with support from the school of arts and humanities at St Edward's University\nAids services of Austin is looking for

up on seven forty one this is K U T Ninety point five\nWhich is that patriarchy and white supremacy have hold on storytelling and other people want their chance\nI wanted to talk about transparent you're very open in your book about your decision to cash to Jeffrey Tambor who is not a transgender woman I'm In the role of a more transparent can you talk a little bit about that decision because it receives a lot of criticism at the time yeah well\nI was really ignorant about trans politics I guess first before I unpack everything that happened I I always want to say that Jeffrey Tambor his portrayal of Mara was absolutely astonishing and beautiful and Jeffrey's a fantastic actor mhm\nBut also I was making huge mistake around traps politics by having assessment play a trans woman\nBecause for trans women they are being accused by people of quote unquote being men dressing up as women that's what makes chance when it's so vulnerable and public so having even\nJeffrey Tambor dressing up as a trans woman\nMay have translated to people who work in the know as this is what trans women are men dressing up as women so not only was it a problem with casting it really was a very very very dangerous dangerous thing for trans women you'd make a different decision now in casting\nPeople asking that question I think time machine questions are really odd because I couldn't go back because the world has changed so much\nAnd when I was making trans parrot I myself really didn't understand my own parents ... yet\nAnd I still had so much of my parents' image in my mind of when she was presenting as assess mail that it didn't even occur to me to cast a trans woman so I think you know it is what it was and what it was was was the show was with Jeffrey in it\n[noise] ten cents ... I'm Jeffrey Tambor was accused by a former crewmember and a member of the cast of sexual harassment I'm with is location to suppress to you yeah they were\nA lot of focus has been on what happened there and we've had so much conversation since\nThose allegations happened about ... people who say they've been harassed or assaulted 'em and after the initial allegations you were really worried about the effect on the show and you wrote I knew it was over for Jeffrey and that meant more on the show or TV family my own family and my parents' reputation everything\nAnd you acknowledge that one of the accusers was upset about that reaction\nI I Know you don't like to go into a time machine but what did you learn from that [noise]\nYeah I uh it was so interesting because you know I was with the people of time is up and an agitating for this notion of you know one of the things that I wrote on a posted as I was like saying what do we want right now in this moment I wrote you know unlock all and da\nAnd ... for non nondisclosure agreements I felt that what Hollywood really needed was to make an accounting of how much money had been spent to put tape over women's mouth\nAnd then I was faced with this instance on our show where some trans women wanted to tell their story and I was confronted I think with my own trans massaging anywhere I didn't immediately say to van and trace let's stand up and tell your story\nInstead I went a little bit into protection mode and as you said about about the show and thought about everybody's financial earnings I'd thought about what the world would think of a show like transparent if it was connected with this reckoning\nWhat I needed to recognize but it took me a minute was the her I was so some of both tries and van for taking their stories and being willing to say them out loud and in many ways sacrifice themselves and in retrospect yeah I Would like a time machine and that one\nWhat's your relationship with them temperate now we haven't spoken in a little while [noise]\nThis is going to keep happening my friend's artist people we admire then to come under scrutiny and it will be painful for their friends and colleagues and I wonder if you have advice now for people who are in the situation you and\nFor me this was a time for emotional tenderness towards everyone especially towards the victims who are willing to sacrifice again it's it's a very sacrificial\nAct um and in terms of the men and the people who are being accused I think it's really about men\nDeeply deeply deeply spending a lot of time and energy trying to understand how patriarchy protects her privilege and thinking of actual ways and tactics that they can take to begin to make up for the harm they've caused before they asked to come back that doesn't mean we don't treat them with tenderness and love\nDoes that mean the same for every ten more for you\nCourse I mean Jeffrey Tambor as a member of my family I never want to put the protection of Jeffrey Tambor his career over the protection of trace was that's career and Ben Barnes career and I think that's what happens is as a culture where naturally patriarchal so we naturally go well what about him and\nI think there are a lot of straight white says men who have ...\nThe ... power and their expectation to continue and that power for the rest of their lives as part of what I think has some unconsciously demanding that they place their pain first before everybody else's\n[noise] she'll sell the way thank you so much for your honesty there memoir is called she wants it thank him\nFor Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm\nWeekend edition is a production of NPR News which is solely responsible for the content to find out more about the books and authors you hear on NPR programs and go to NPR dot org slash book there you'll find author interviews NPR's best seller rest and\nFind out what our staff as reading [noise]\n\nThis has weekend edition from NPR News I'm the guy the end of our\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Wallace Foundation fostering improvements in learning and enrichment for disadvantaged children and the vitality of the arts for everyone ideas at Wallace Foundation dot org from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men\nStarring John Slattery Amanda peach Paul Ryan ...
