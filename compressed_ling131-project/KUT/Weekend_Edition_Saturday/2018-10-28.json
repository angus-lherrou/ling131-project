democracy and it is the fiftieth anniversary of the R rating we'll get your R rated memories without the profanity because we are\nPG it Sunday October twenty eight twenty Eighteen the news is coming up now live\nOf course [noise] so what is your reaction to this\nSo what we see here is is really the result of an a a very tragic an unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism anti Semitism over the past several years\nIn calendar year twenty Seventeen we saw the largest single increase of anti Semitic incidents in recent times we saw in nearly a sixty percent increase in anti Semitic incidents and twenty Seventeen over the previous year twenty sixteen\nIn addition we saw in nearly a Ninety percent increase in anti Semitic incidents in K. through twelve classrooms in schools across the United\nStates before we get to why you think this is happening when you say anti Semitic incidence ... discussing\nWhen we're talking about an anti Semitic incident at a at a school in a classroom at a K. through twelve\nIt's everything from a ... a swastika on a bathroom wall\nTo instances in a and most recently in a western state where a a student um made very callous and cold references related to the to the death of Jews and the Holocaust is part of a Valentine's Day project and so it really takes all different shapes informs just three weeks ago here in northern Virginia\nA I was at the Jewish community center in Fairfax where Nineteen swastikas were spray painted on the side of a really a community center where people come to exercise and and whole community based events so it really takes all forms\n[noise] why do you think this is happening now\nI think a couple of things that ... in in recent years I'm there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and off line that the normalization of rhetoric\nAnd from the highest levels of retreats of individuals like David Duke from posts in and re statements that are associated with white nationalist in this country has has almost become normal or part of a a a global discourse\nIn addition to that uh the political divide in this country has become so toxic and when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti Semitism has really led twelve volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week\nAlso this week a bottomless delivered to the home of George Soros is also Jewish we've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about him on mainstream conservative TV news like Fox even\nCorrect ... and in fact in a ... a deal recently released some reporting\nUm that goes back in ... a lot of the conspiracy theories and they have their roots in anti Semitic conspiracy theories as well this is something that we've unfortunately seen play out um both in the all fine and online space as\nSome of the most vitriolic or anti Semitic attacks against source and others um have really come out uh in the past year or two and it's something that you deal will remain constant and vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis\n[noise] uh we should also say this shooter um was also trafficking in these conspiracy theories he apparently believe that the caravan coming from Central America which has been repeatedly disgusted by the president and others are was being sponsored by Jewish organizations correct\nOn one of the Jewish organizations that was mentioned in some of his his post was highest an organization this tremendous work on on refugees and ... as well as the Anti Defamation league I mean there were several posting comments in his open source social media um\nThere were many victims in this case a that we're in Pittsburgh and beyond and it's up to us as a global community of citizens and organizations to remain vigilant and push back against all forms of anti Semitism discrimination and bigotry and we are committed to doing\nSo George ... senior vice president for programs at the Anti Defamation league thank you so much for coming in thank you\nAnd not to Brazil voters there are choosing their next president and the outcome could fundamentally change the political landscape of the reach leading in the polls ahead of today's final run off is ...\nHe's a five ... far right congressman who admires the Brazilian military dictatorship that came to power in the sixties and ruled for over

been wandering in many of them wrapped in a in Brazil national flag on this has\nBeen a very ugly campaign um can you just fill us in unwind motions are running so high [noise]\nWhat indeed it has I mean there've been lots of reports of politically motivated attacks against the algae beat the community and the tax or threats against you in the soles of this election is about anger and it's about the\nUh many people are voting for the most NATO or angry at the leftist workers' party that ruled Brazil Thirteen the last Fifteen Years president Luiz ... Lula da Silva who was president much of that time is now in jail for corruption\nDuring the later stages of the Workers Party government there was a terrible recession\nThere was a sort of a humiliating huge corruption scandal and the impeachment of ... Juma Rousseff\nAt the same time opponents of bumps and NATO are angry and fearful\nAbout him at his record of intolerance as you know he's a he's an infamous for making sexist racist remarks and they're worried about what his presidency might bring\nAnd yet the polls say that he will win how much trustee putting in those numbers [noise] well\nAbout a week ago he had an Eighteen point lead in the polls and he looked pretty unassailable ah his opponent for now that would that have the workers' party has been\nMaking headway in the last few days on the eve of election polls have the gap between them around ten points which means it's still pretty unlikely that she can win but not impossible\nWe only have a few seconds left what about the concerns that the ...\nUm his political opponents and journalists but on the right and I got an email from members of my family who are on the right in President Trump's supporters\nAnd they see Democrats protesting and view that as hounding politicians 'em and they say that there has been many inflammatory messages coming from the left and they leave the blame on them is this an endless cycle of what about is a huge both looked at this um how do you litigate this it is so hyper part is now\nI definitely we run into people it's probably ten to twelve percent on the far riot and eight to ten percent on the far left the researchers tell us who have no interest\nIn closing this divide who wants to feed this divide but that leaves a full Seventy five or eighty percent of us who when we are put in a different context with the purpose of stepping back\nAnd taking a look at who are you in a larger context than your political label what they discovered they often like each other and kind of actually work well together and that's the hope of how we get out of where we are today\n[noise] I agree with Carolyn I'm I Do think though that we have to consider the power dynamics um so\nThe president of the United states has a uniquely powerful\nPosition to amplify the messages that he's sending out in ways that that the rest of us don't I also think we need to think about the impact of this rhetoric on immigrant communities in the United states there's research documenting that pernicious health effects people are afraid to send their kids to school they're afraid to go to the doctor um and so\nYou know we think about rhetoric and language and how it's how all of us need to take responsibility\nFor the past it we also need to account for those whose lives are being deeply affected by it right now\n[noise] Carolyn ... executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse at the University of Arizona and ... assistant professor of sociology\nAt Washington University in St Louis thank you thank you for having us thank you\nBefore the shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh we asked listeners to call in and tell us what did they find connection at this moment when

Saturday morning we just heard a press conference where the names of the deceased or I'm told to us and we now have with us rabbi Chuck time that he was one of the synagogues rabbis until about a year ago\nAnd he is still a member of the community has been spending time with the community in the wake of this a terrible terrible event thank you\nFor being with us yeah good morning\nI'm so now we knows the names of those who were killed I mean do you know who they are did they sound familiar team\nYeah I I I mean I suspect that a bit hearing the names was quite chilling and shake me up a bit I have to say I knew um at least ten of eleven fairly well\nYou have spent time with these families um can you tell me what the reaction has been in the wake of this\nYeah I spent a little time yesterday I have to say with before the people really knew but these were people who hadn't heard about their relatives some of the day went on a sort of became clear that the news was not good [noise]\nUm these are wonderful people good souls\nWho are just coming to synagogue 'cause they usually did they were synagogue was just getting started and mostly elderly people who come there or there at the beginning and you could count on them every week for coming um they mentioned the one woman\nBoroughs who in her nineties you know but she was one of the younger ones among us I have to tell you in terms of her spirit\nRather than ... years old\nBut just the rose was wonderful and and um I mean and the brothers and all of them I'm just such wonderful sweet so and it's such a prime of their lives were taken from us\nYeah I Hope you were ... you will not at the center of the time of the shooting that you did arrive on the scene shortly after\nThat yeah I live I live in the community I've grown up in Pittsburgh uh lived here for most of my life [noise] um what did you see\nWell ... there was a quarter and you really couldn't get close to the synagogue so basically I came down it was right around the block from where I live and you know I I wanted to try to comfort people and try to do something whatever I could do and I ran into some people who were waiting to hear about their relatives who we know where they're\nAlso to see some people who I thought would would have been there some were delayed by traffic or were sick or whatever it might have been and didn't make it there um and uh it was just a\nYou know when it hits it hits home if if it's some extra hard to deal with\nYou spent time also yesterday at a Greek center what did you tell people how do you counsel people about something like that\nYeah well I think just being there for them and letting them know that there are people there for them you hogs and letting people cry on your shoulder and and just letting them know again you're going to be there for them and um I I did have to [noise]\nTo tell one I'm a woman that her brothers [noise] the one of her brothers who I knew at the time has been killed from what I've heard and I have to tell her that I mean that's part of\nThat must have been so hard\nIt is very hard but it's part of I think being a rabbi [noise] um but she deserve to know what I knew at that time um as far as her other brother I didn't know at the time we did just that know what the story was\nSo there was an uncertainty there um there were a lot of people that are helping who came to try to you know Pittsburgh is that you've heard the wonderful community suddenly wonderful Jewish community it's just a wonderful community we have\nA wonderful medical facilities the police to do an excellent job our politicians are good good leaders and the leaders of the Jewish community are strong and it also the Jewish community gets along together one with another even though we believe and maybe different kinds of things\nSo it's very special it's been a special place to grow up in a special place to raise my kids I have to say I'm very grateful to have that opportunity so that was our immediate job is and that is to comfort the mourners and to comfort the community and and to just be strong as we take each day as it comes\nWell my Chuck diamond thank you very much for speaking with us in our deepest condolences on such a sad day\nAppreciate that I Hope it's for joyous occasion we can be together\nIndeed okay thank you thank you Bye bye Bye bye [noise]\nTo help us make sense of something so senseless hum we are now joined by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson 'em and put this into context as well because there were package bomb sent a prominent Democrat this past week and this is affecting our political discourse in our political leaders good morning Mara\nHigh they're little and President Trump held a political rally in Illinois in the wake of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue what did he have to say yeah let me just say a few thoughts\nFirst of all my mom grew up in the Jewish community yeah Pittsburgh she's Ninety to my cousins all grew up in this world hill\nAnd what we're talking about I think is the worst anti Semitic attack in us history just days after as you just said the largest assassination attempt on political leaders in us history so too horrific violent\nActs and the president has had a lot of unifying words he has spoken out against what he's called pure evil\nBut he has followed those words with partisan attacks politics as usual and his rallies with a little less ... he said last night and his rally in Illinois I'm going to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut it's also true and we are going to have a big debate about this that he has tweeted that George Soros funded the caravan the George ... June ... also posted on social media the Jews were funding the caravan he particularly\nI was angry about the Hebrew immigrant aid society\nAnd\nThe Kevin McCarthy the majority leader\nIn the house has been tweeting how Soros dire and Bloomberg are trying to steal this election which is pretty coated anti Semitic language so we're going to have a big debate about whether the president's words words of other\nPeople helped create this climate nobody's saying that in any way the president is responsible for what happened but there is what he says and then there is what\nPeople here we're also going to have a big debate about gun control right after the incident the president said that if there had been more people with guns in the synagogue this wouldn't have happened already you've heard the Pittsburgh mayor and the governor of Pennsylvania say no that's not the answer so\nTen days nine days out from the election we've got the situation to process and try to figure out how to stop in the future\nMine let me just say first of all I'm so sorry I didn't realize that you had a personal connection to the synagogue this this is not at the synagogue just at the community\nTo the community I mean you mentioned that there are of course many ramifications a mid term elections are just over a week away will the events of this past week affect the elections and if so how well\nI don't know I think the easy answer the quick answers to said that the trajectory of this election is pretty well set\nA house looks like it's trending to the Democrats the Senate looks like it's trending to the Republicans\nBut it might have some effect I mean this once again through us gun violence into the political debate some people might be reminded them how they felt after the Parkland shootings maybe that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that\nIt makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has asked you complained about that he said that\nHe meant him and now this bomb thing happened and that's all the media is talking about if you've been listening to special coverage from NPR News\nAnd you're listening to him on K U T Ninety point five\nIn Texas politics

really a community center where people come to exercise and and whole community based events so it really takes all forms\n[noise] why do you think this is happening now\nI think a couple of things that ... in in the recent years\nI'm there has been a normalization of hate and extremism both online and off line that the normalization of rhetoric and from the highest levels of re tweets of individuals like David Duke\nFrom posts in and re statements that are associated with white nationalist in this country has has almost become normal or part of a a a global discourse\nIn addition to that uh the political divide in this country has become so toxic and when combined with the normalization of this type of hate speech and anti Semitism has really led twelve volatile atmosphere that we've seen play out just in the past week\nAlso this week or a bomb was delivered to the home of George Soros is also Jewish we've seen a lot of trafficking of conspiracy theories about hand on mainstream conservative TV news like Fox even\nCorrect and in fact in a ... a deal recently released some reporting um that goes back in ... a lot of the conspiracy theories and they have their roots in anti Semitic conspiracy theories as well this is something that we've unfortunately seen play out\nUm both in the all fine and online space as some of the most vitriolic or anti Semitic attacks against ... and others have really come out uh in the past year or two and it's something that you deal will remain constant and vigilant in combating on a day in and day out basis\n[noise] uh we should also say this shooter um was also a trafficking in these conspiracy theories he apparently believe that the cat and coming from Central America which has been repeatedly discussed at by the

Navarro\nAccording to his social media posts the alleged synagogue shooter was obsessed with immigration and the caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U. S. highlighted by the president and others on the right we have an update now from our Carrie Kahn who was in Honduras where many of the migrants are from\nThe numbers of migrants in the Caribbean has steadily declined since deporting the country more than two weeks ago some dropped out some state in Mexico and others have been deported shoot ports many have landed back in the place where the care that originally started the central bus station in the Honduran city of some sort of\nUm his political opponents and journalists but on the right and I got an email from members of my family who are on the right in President Trump's supporters\nAnd they see Democrats protesting and view that as hounding politicians 'em and they say that there has been many inflammatory messages coming from the left and they lay the blame on them is this an endless cycle of what about is I'm a huge both looked at this um how do you litigate this is so hyper part is now\nI definitely we run into people it's probably ten to twelve percent on the far riot and eight to ten percent on the far left the researchers tell us who have no interest\nIn closing this divide who want to feed this divide but that leaves a full Seventy five or eighty percent of us who when we are put in a different context with the purpose of stepping back\nAnd taking a look at who are you in a larger context than your political label what they discovered they often like each other and kind of actually work well together and that's the hope of how we get out of where we are today\n[noise] I agree with Carolyn I'm I Do think though that we have to consider the power dynamics um so the\nPresident of the United states have that uniquely powerful position to amplify the messages that he's sending out in ways that that the rest of us don't I also think we need to think about the impact of this rhetoric on immigrant community in the United states there's research documenting that [noise]\nThat's just how it affects people are afraid to send their kids to school they're afraid to go to the doctor um and so you know we think about rhetoric and language and how it's how all of us need to take responsibility for the past it we also need to account for those whose lives are being deeply affected by it right now\n[noise] Carolyn ... executive director of the national\nInstitute for civil discourse at the University of Arizona and ... assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St Louis thank you thank you for having us thank you\nBefore the shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh we asked listeners to call in and tell us what did they find connection at this moment when the nation is so very divided\nMany of the responses we got we're reminder of how difficult that connection is defined right now some of you wrote that you long for those kinds of places but these days common ground is hard to find but there were a few bright spots\nEvery week I have regularly scheduled conversations with seniors we call it book club\nHeather ... is an outreach librarian at the bay county public library in Panama City Florida she says they talk about everything and anything including politics at one assisted living facility the club is especially diverse deeply conservative Floridians liberal New Englanders transplants from Europe\nAnd the group where we are happy to see one another and so eager to talk we won't soldier on through any topic that comes up we had some heated moments but with friends or just in time to wander together to the dining room for lunch\nMenu

everyone and our guide for motion but we are so numerous there is no pavement left on which to release our bodies like a reverse spilling over a damn so instead my body through on this next to yours in place\nWhen we stopped traffic or hold hands to form a human chain we become a neon open signed singing into the night miles from home when the only home last is memory your body my body are scars the dark punctuated with the dying light of stars\nThank you for reading it it's\nJust such an such it's such a striking\nPoem and it is the last poem in your collection which is I think is interesting it's an interesting pumped to go out on it's a very powerful poem [laughter] I Wonder if you would you be a little bit about where the poem\nEnds and there's a you and the title of remember you as you were not as what you will become and then the first line of the poem if you are fearful America I can tell you I Am too so you know your reader is is sort of confident in in um\nThe you they're being America this is a poem to America\nBut then the home really kind of the youth seems to\nBecome over the course of the poem an actual individual and I wonder if you could speak a little bit about how you moved toward the ending of the poem and a little bit about that\nSure so this is an interesting home and that it's one that I wrote after attending the women's march in Washington DC in January of twenty Seventeen\nAnd one of the experiences that so cynical about being out in the street during a march particularly one like that one where it was so crowded was that you know I was literally stuck in the street at various points which has the experience that inspired this home\nBut then one of the things I was really exploring in my new book called him only carry me was the injunction in Las Vegas you should love your neighbor as yourself and what is that actually mean\nAnd so that shift in the view from America to a more intimate I you relationship in that second stands out to me\nReally encompasses the tension in in that idea of what does it mean to love your neighbor\nAs yourself when you're really different what does it mean to have a collective experience as people in a country when we're supposed to be really bifurcated\nYeah I have two little kids and they oh is that my oldest one who's a in sixth grade he loves factoids and so he was really into this idea that the light that we see from star is started already dead\nAnd not something that when did its way into this ending which to me feels somehow simultaneously I think uplifting and a little depressing at the same time in the sense that there's a light but it to dying light\nFind I'll Remember you as you were not as what you'll become an air conditioners new\nHoly moly carry
