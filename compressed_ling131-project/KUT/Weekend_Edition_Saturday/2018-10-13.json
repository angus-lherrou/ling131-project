{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "I gather there's films being shown at at some schools and organizations um to to try and picked exactly the problem that you're you're portrayed on screen is there something that you learned from doing the movie and hope people take away from it [noise] she'd girl\n[noise] uh yeah I guess my biggest takeaway is that addiction itself\nIt can happen to anyone it can happen to any family this seemingly functional very loving group of people fell victim to this and\nIt crosses all sorts of boundaries that doesn't discriminate and as we were filming\nAnd then people understood what are the themes of the film were we could be almost anywhere and people came out of the woodwork with their personal stories of addiction and recovery and loss and it was striking to me that it has\nUm really affected so many people if you don't know someone personally you know someone who knows someone and\nTimothy showing\nI think first and foremost it's what Steve said which is a conversation with people and Saturn locations we were shooting and realizing that almost everyone is either affected her know someone who was affected by this disease and um and also I Would hope for those who hopefully see it would achieve like\nThat it isn't um especially in the case of methamphetamine users quote in the film from a doctor it's not that he is a perhaps unwilling to participate in treatment options might be that he's unable in that it's not um there's this idea of willpower or a\nMisconception of willpower perhaps as being a he'll pick yourself up by your bootstraps sort of way of getting yourself that it was kind of situation and\nWhen it's much more complex than that and and the greatest answers are the ones that lead you down a greater understanding of how comprehensible this all is but that a family support and love and ultimately perseverance and within the resources that are out there\nOne can one can persevere and get through this\nI think this is a story about love and there's a scene in which my character has to essentially turn his back on his son because\nUh he realizes it's the best thing for the rest of his family and it's the only thing he's left with it's the only thing it it says only recourse at that point and there was a difficult thing because it goes against every fiber and my being as a parent\nUm and it was hard to wrap my head around the idea of turning my back on a on a child but it's true and it's I think very real and it's\nIt's such a gray area that's the other thing I found with this material and the story is that there are no easy answers there is no there's no happy ending really there's perhaps a hopeful ending but ah\nAs is most often the case with the scenarios or it's ... it's ongoing\nTimothy shall in my house is Nick\nNick as well and uh\nYeah he said he's not an expert on addiction and that he found for his recovery it was almost like I'm finding puzzle pieces of what worked what didn't work\nAnd um and I think he's I think he's well he's only speak for him but Steven I hadn't had lunch with him and do David and ah it's been a joy to get to spend time with them since the phones motion\nSteve grill and Timothy shall I may star in the new film beautiful boy\nThanks very much both thank you thank you [noise]\nYou're listening to weekend edition from NPR News\nToo hotly contested races in deep red Kansas illustrate a broader Republican divide over immigration policy [noise]\nOne candidate has embraced President Trump's get tougher approach the other has rejected the administration charger tactics and rhetoric as Brian grim it with Kansas news service reports both approaches could have consequences at the polls\nAt a recent campaign rally in Kansas talking tough on immigration was clearly a crowd pleaser\nWe've worked on a number of things but the most important is stopping illegal immigration [noise]\nGovernor standing next to President Trump Kobach\nHas made a career stoking anti immigrant sentiment a secretary of state he's pushed for new rules requiring that people show proof of citizenship before registering to vote\nAs a private attorney he works with cities across the country to help pass ordinances that make hiring or renting to undocumented immigrants unlawful at the rally Kobach warned that immigrants here illegally or a drain on the state's finance it\nGets time what Kansas first not illegal aliens [laughter]\nPlays well Republicans in the state the Trump won by a wide margin it also plays well in rural Kansas where there's ... about immigrants taking jobs in bringing crime but that writer could hurt Kobach with voters in the growing suburbs of Kansas City\nThat's where representative Kevin Yoder another Republican is taking a more moderate tone when it comes to immigration he has been endorsed by Trump but didn't appear at the rally\nIn an interview with Casey you are in Kansas City you're says he supports Trump's crack down on illegal immigration and border wall but he's also willing to work across the aisle\nI also supported a democratic plan that would make sure the DACA kids can't be deported also supported the Democratic plan that would ensure that we can't separate parents from their children that\nApproach may have won over some moderates but it alienated those further to the right to conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham she blasted Yoder for supporting a democratic plan that would make it easier for migrants fleeing domestic abuse to get asylum in the United states\nYoder said he sympathized with the victims because his mother was a social worker here's her response on Fox News\nYour family history shouldn't be allowed to thwart the president's

people potentially to make fraudulent claims\nUsers district is increasingly home to wealthy college educated people in its skewing more democratic Hillary Clinton nearly won the district to two years ago University of Kansas political science professor Patrick Miller says Yoder is projecting a more centrist image to appeal to those changing demographics\nYou know he he really hasn't walked away from Trump's policies yet he's attempted to say things are expressed concern over things like children being detained that might seem more sympathetic to what's really a swing district that he represents\nIn several recent polls Yoder is trailing his challenger Democrat Sharif David and Kobach isn't a dead heat with his Democratic rival Laura Kelly\nIn Kansas as in other parts of the country it's unclear which strategy will work in the mid term whether that's reaching out to moderates or ignoring them and relying on Trump's base for NPR News I'm Brian Gorman in Wichita, Kansas

fire that they've ever confronted and their their careers until very recently it was the largest structural fire in the history of Los Angeles\nTo fire reminded you I guess your phrase that the the many Senegalese have for death [noise]\nIt was an incredible phrase which is when someone dies a library burns down meaning the person's own house give memories and store\nIs an anecdotes that we store in our minds disappears when someone dies and it struck me as being a wonderful\nWay of seeing why libraries feel like these big collective brains because they have the memories and stories of a whole culture inside them\n[noise] we we mentioned the I'm more than a million books destroyed or damaged in Los Angeles but you're also staggered to reading your book how much stuff there isn't a greater urban libraries just stuff what Russia is lost in LA\nAmong the things that were lost in the fire the library had every\nAutomobile manual for every making model of car starting with the model T those all disappeared\nPatents that does that's recording all of the patents in the United states and Canada those were all loss and artifacts like puppets from a famous puppet theater that exist in the forties and fifties\nPeople look at libraries as being these repositories of\nI guess what you would just say are the flotsam and ... some of thinking and storytelling and those end up in libraries\n[noise] and to be sure there was a human cost to the employees of the Los Angeles public library for the seven years it'd been burned and closed wasn't there\nIt was devastating this was the life's work of these librarians we think of libraries is just somehow\nGetting books but it doesn't work like that librarians build the collection of their department they choose the books\nFrom their own interests and knowledge and when those disappear you don't just go and click a button and replace them all I mean many of them are books that can't be found any more\nSo for these librarians it was absolutely devastating to see the books destroyed what I thought was really interesting as many of them suffered terrible anxiety and depression over the idea that they were no longer serving their patrons and they\nThe city hired a psychologist to meet with the librarians because they really were traumatized\n[laughter] investigators began to suspect arson and suspicions began before all

dreaming that he would someday be an actor because if you live\nAnywhere within the magnetic pole of Los Angeles that comes to mind he came to the city with no training as an actor and in fact he discovered he had stage fright sometimes I think what he really dreamed of was not acting\nBut living the way actors live or at least in his magic nation at having a glamorous life having everything in your life\nJust be larger than life\nHow many different versions of events did he did he eventually supply about his whereabouts have day in his actions\nHe had seven Alibis which is not

prosecute him could there he\nWas arrested but they they never indicted him but the story ended up getting very complicated because many people in city and many many firefighters were absolutely convinced that he had started the fire\nYou take it shouldn't have the workings of the library today and ... conducted digital age doesn't everybody have a library at their fingertips [noise]\nEverybody has information at their fingertips but a library also is a place\nI think what I began to realize was that\nThe emotions I felt about a library were partly because oh it's so exciting there's so much great stuff here\nBut some of it was being in a place that I share with other people and we're all looking for whatever it is that we're interested in at that moment and there's something wonderful about that\nThere's also a lot of stuff that is not on line and that is going to remain true probably for eternity\nAnd in the original co working space to [noise]\nThat was the one of the things that I realized there was a period of time when I was working on the book and I just couldn't work at home anymore so I rented space in a co working space and then one day I

weeks ago before the midterm elections\n\nWay to get out and vote in November\nWhere everything is just ... there are four hundred and thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the line\nWeekend leading up to election day we're here with a special broadcast to guide you through what could move to vote this November I'm Henry\nThis one phrase dominated the political conversation angry mob how President Trump publications or using democratic outrage at Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThe G A day\nPlus most people don't come out from mid term election\nAre these non why don't they vote and what would happen if they did [noise]\nAll of that and more after this news\nJust to kind of thing that happens in elections when people are angry\nAnd upset and frustrated with whatever the policies are you know I covered a lot of the Tea Party and certainly those crowds were energized and in your face or you know as a member of the media I remember being accosted by a lot of people at some of those events questioning news coverage\nUm and the like they were upset [laughter]\n\nYou know they were frustrated I Would say the violence quote unquote was pretty minimal and there isn't really that much violence now either but there is a lot more confrontation the sort of idea of civility in the public space has kind of gone away\nAnd you know not all Democrats are totally comfortable with this approach either they they may feel that it's good to be pushing back on Republicans on substance but they also worry and I've talked to him a particularly a number of aids who are working on political issues\nWho tell me that they are concerned that this could backfire that it could alienate people moderate Republicans or independents who had made up their mind yet\nWho will start to associate these kind of tactics was all Democrats and that's not what they want right now when they're trying to be a bigger tent party rather than a you know at ... cultivating an image of themselves as simply the resistance\nI'm trying to figure out what exactly we're talking about here though are we talking about the women who came to the capital and told senators about when they were assaulted are we talking about people with signs out on the Supreme Court steps like where where does this become a mob\nYeah well isn't that kind of the point of using the term on is that it it transitions away from the conversation about those very different groups of people that you're talking about and makes it a conversation about a group of undefined people write I talked to a\nGeorge lake off who is a professor emeritus from a University of California at Berkeley\nFocused on linguistics he is a liberal and he said that by using this you're you're saying that these are not rational actors these are people who are making a point that they feel passionately about their kind of acting irrationally and that they're not thinking for themselves or just part of this group think\nYeah and look over thanks is this is about trying to keep the Republican base fired up after Kavanaugh getting confirmed we saw a spike and enthusiasm with the Republican base during the Kavanaugh fight well there's a big risk because they won't be that motivated\nAs one Republican strategist Ken Spain who was the communications director for the ... the arm that gets ... tries to get Republicans elected to the house and he said look Republicans have been suffering from an intensity deficit over the course of the last few months and raising the threat level will hopefully translate to generating greater turnout\nAnd he said this really has to do with those red states like Texas in Tennessee\nFor the Senate to try to maintain the Senate because this fires up Republicans\nThat was NPR's to ... this is the politics show from NPR\nWe are talking to diminish go Ayesha Rascoe and Kelsey Snell Kelsey\nAnd that's precisely what McConnell said when I talked to him he said that this is coming at the perfect time\nThat it's coming on the eve of the election and when I asked him to predict how many Republicans were going to be in the Senate next year he declined to give me an actual number but what he said to me was that voters are going to know that the Supreme Court fight underscores\nFor Republican voters that the Senate is what he called in the personnel business\nAnd that the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years for President Trump is Republicans lose\nDemocrats reacting to all this\nDemocrats haven't been really able to come up with a clear message and to frame the message in a way that people could relate to to to say that this is what we're fighting for this is what we're concerned about this is why people are out there screaming or why people were out there who why people may be so passionate\nThat they haven't been really able to articulate that\nWell we saw the former attorney general Eric Holder who's been involved in these midterms go out and\nSay she always says if you don't when they go low we\nGo low we heard all kinds of outrage\nOn the right uh you know people going after him saying he was spring on violence\nAnd he said they should stop the fake outrage but it's certainly feeling them\nAnd it it seems like all of this moment people are tired of when you talk about civility when you talk about uh going high they're saying that didn't work for us and they're saying that the other side has not done that so they would argue that the Republicans have not gone high that the Tea Party was not polite\nThat President Trump is not civil and\nHe's he's not always polite and he says a lot of things are so why shouldn't they fight fire with fire\nWill also when I talked to activists stuff here a couple of them said to me that they don't see a point in being polite when they feel like they're ... they're very real risks to some of their core beliefs and the political system right now and that when\n... when President Obama was being polite it was when he was in power and that there's just simply a difference here that knew that Democrats feel that they have no power and the situation and their visceral reaction is coming from that place of of fear\nAnd frankly the frustration on the part of Democrats you know\nPresident Obama thought that he could get a lot of things done with Republicans in a good faith negotiating way and it just didn't happen\nThat was NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Kelsey Snell and medical ... thanks everyone thank you thank you\nAnd Dominican stick with it now it's time for racial\nRuns the United States Senate\nShrinking fifty seven people of color need your help we will never found out why and if we\nThe way but [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all over the place this week we're looking at Minnesota's\nEighth congressional district Dominican you're still with us and I want to bring in mark the deck like of Minnesota Public radio hey mark thanks for joining us\nIt's my pleasure of a big fan of the show thanks for having me\nOff thank you so mark what's it been like they're on the ground\nMinnesota's just a hot bed of political activity this year not just in the eighth district remembers sooner Al Franken he resigned in January his seat needs to be filled in a special election Minnesota center image corporate shark is up\nHer regular reelection Minnesota's also choosing a new governor and three new members of Congress were really busy over here\nYou know the sixty competitive districts that the cook Political Report less as either lean to one party or as a toss up only three of those are democratic held seats in Minnesota there are two of those seats and one of them is what we're talking about here today\nSo again we're looking at the age congressional district in Minnesota Tim ... who is in this race well\nThis is an open seat that's because the Democrat Rick Nolan who's the congressman holds the seat is not running for reelection in Minnesota the Democratic party is referred to as the Democratic farmer labor party and that candidate is Joe ... he's a former state representative he's thirty two years old\nOr the Republican candidate is Pete Stauber he's a St Louis county commissioner he's a retired Duluth, Minnesota police officer and there's an independent in this race too so how he's going to shape this race is gonna be interesting his name is ray sandman people columns skipped\nSo this is a district where in sort of an unusual thing for twenty Eighteen Republicans are on offing right and if\nDemocrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats Janette to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years have a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points from the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest wing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd to the demographics tell a lot of that story telling them\nThey do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's lessening the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August so ... had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play\nMining is a big issue up in the eighth district the third party candidate\nIs talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the race of Independence Party candidate people of support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat both wrote that veterans tub or have been talking also a lot about taking back our government here as a Democrat ... debate\nAnd this is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and if you're just joining us I'm Talking with Dominican ... and ... about why people may not vote in the upcoming midterm elections are some of it is also comes down to just not not feeling like you know what your options are\nBut I Will say I I don't know that that's always the case our colleague\nDon Gonyea spent some time in ... county West Virginia which has really really low voter turnout and he met a guy there his name is Josh ... he\nBasically feels like his vote doesn't matter he's he's unemployed he used to work on in the restaurant business but said the last time he voted at all for president with two thousand four for John Kerry\nAh I just I don't think my vote matters not at all not Hiller I'm wanting to popular vote we still have Trump for president so direct on American down yes\nAnd these are places and we saw this with a lot of the places we visited that often have pretty dire financial situations like that the poverty rate is particularly high and some of these places you'll meet a lot of folks who are unemployed\nAnd they don't feel like politicians come talk to them they don't feel like politicians are spending time with them and he talked to them about you know have you gotten mailings have you gotten leaflets none of them feel like they're contacted by politicians even yeah\nI mean it's obviously something that President Trump capitalized on twenty sixteen being able to run on sort of an economic populist\nMessage a and the cultural grievance message where he's able to talk to especially whites without a college degree to say that you're the forgotten man and woman and we did see an uptick right from a rural voters in a lot of in a lot of places\nThat sort of help Trump get over the line but I have heard from a lot of people that they feel like their vote doesn't matter right because\nYou know you look at the electoral system and if you're in a liberal state state's probably going to go that way and if you're in a red state than your ... your vote probably going to go towards the Republican\nBut you know I Will just say that specially when it comes down to the local levels votes really can and do matter because I went and looked up at least half a dozen races over the past ten to Fifteen Years in state house races in particular that were decided by one vote\nThat's amazing that's incredible uh it's also incredible that lesson forty percent of people who could vote do vote in midterms\nAs only you know it's made easy you know we vote on Tuesdays ... which was designed for an agrarian society you know in November\nSo [laughter] you know this has not been updated and we definitely have one party that has more of a sense of urgency to go and make these changes to make it easier to vote because a lot of these voters have been talking about our core key democratic\nGroup here right to make and there's one other group actually I really wanted us to talk about and to your point too many cars they also tend to lean more democratic and those are folks of color in particular Latino and Asian Americans have really low voter participation rates there even lower in mid term election years\nAnd ironically the two fastest growing groups in the country by ... exactly\nAnd and and so you hear this time and again and you can even go to places you know this election cycle people have talked a lot about Beto O'Rourke who is challenging Ted Cruz\nIn Texas for the Democrats or the Senate\nAnd and what that could mean and we have one of our colleagues who also went down and spend some time in El Paso\nThat his whereabouts O'Rourke is from and and she met people who didn't know battle was didn't really know who's running for office and it just felt like they didn't put their face in politics because they felt like they've never banked on political institutions changing their lives and there's one woman in particular\nWho made this point uh her name is Christina Rodriguez she was in El Paso but I\nReally don't think about it I kind of sad to say but I don't think about like okay well what can be better and it's like I Do it I can do to make my life I don't depend on them to change things for him\nThat's an amazing quote there is this sense of powerlessness that I met from a lot of people that they don't feel like things have changed so therefore whoever's in office you\nKnow they're just sort of moving along because they don't notice a change from President to president and the races that could make the biggest difference in your life like maybe city council\nOr school board or are the\nThe state legislature those are the sexy races they everybody talks about those are the ones where it's really hard to get information about who the candidates are and that and that leaves people feeling like they they don't know who to vote for\nAnd it's a huge issue in the southwest in particular I mean you look at Texas Arizona we were talking about Nevada where\nYou have this huge surge of Latino and yet\nOr not registered to vote so every time you hear people talking about how Democrats could turn Texas blue for example that is really reliant on Democrats being able to not just get Latinos to vote against Latinos registered to vote and then be fired up to vote for them and in fact there's actually a growing gap\nOr that's been seen between the number of eligible Latino voters versus the number of Latino voters who've cast a ballot over the years\nSo what would happen if all these non voters showed up on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November well first of all they might not be able to vote because you have to be registered before the deadline so people need to go look that up if you're if you're considering it and many of those deadlines or this by the way or asked\nRight but if that were to happen [noise]\nHey or polls would probably be a lot more accurate because we'd have a better sense an ability to to map out by demographics how people would likely vote or it would certainly changed the shape of not just the races in this country but I think ... has been making the point\nAbout public policy as well that was NPR's off a holiday and medical ... thanks much guys You're welcome [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and it feels like there are always stories that we just can't get too because there's so much other political news so every week we take a few minutes to dig in on some of those headlines that you may have missed and to do that\nWe always have run out saying hello hello tab\nSo let's start with buying the Justice Department unsealed charges this week against a suspected Chinese spies for allegedly conducting espionage fill us in\nOkay that we're not talking about the usual kind of cloak and dagger military spying here this is about high tech competition between major economies\nSo what is the U.S government allege\nThe individual in question the Chinese individual posed as an official of a tech association but was in fact when official and Chinese intelligence\nAnd he invited a GE engineer to visit China stayed in touch tried to get specific proprietary information and so he was arrested in Brussels or Belgian authorities and has been extradited to the United states to face trial up but this could be a big deal because even though it's economic as we say\nIt's the first time someone believed to be in Chinese intelligence has been brought to the United states to stand\nTrial [laughter] okay moving on the environmental protection agency has taken some new actions to weaken regulations is that right Ron\nThis was the week that the United nations came out with a big report giving the world's governments essentially a decade to get serious about climate change before it's too late that got a certain amount of attention\nBut not so much attention has gone to some of the individual things the EPA has been deciding having to do with various kinds of pollution and this particular week\nOf the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution\nNow that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come at a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals are weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and ah last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the\nEnvironment right the last story involved health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as the Senate can be you know division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into a bomb a care they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got a more permanent arrangement other Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd um so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars in patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine log they couldn't repeal [noise]\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other news that's happening thank you Ron", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition
