Hi tai chi chi\nSo let me start with you ah and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report\nAs it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number yeah\nThe headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the month and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNew it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there is a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's plan it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which isn't the stimulus ... and stronger graft and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of ... percent in this latest GDP read and so right now um things are looking good economically speaking it\nAnd Ted because the consumer is good\nI I hear some trepidation do in your voice Neal\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect they caught him and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three ... concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd carrots and trade tension concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market you can really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears ... point them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those towers but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists then hotel like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business group so I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nNeal another item from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed a shared budget pal or his biggest ah economic problem I'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with the president says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about Rachel what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ... well\nYou know it makes a hard job even that much harder right\nSo what does that is really concerned about\nIt how they keep the economic bull market running how they keep economic growth in and stop\nLung still normalizing policy because winning us and we know that it will be all end eventually the neck and been session hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here and very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of\nA very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for poor\nMiddle Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink ... thanks ...\nOf a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right will have the details when we do the numbers\n[noise]\n\nAnd [noise]\n\nHard\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that\nIs Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due would you dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping rose all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster would the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at ESPN peak\nLevel what you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax reform for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact starting to bite\nAt least at that country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research pull fifty to present the terrorists have no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWe've gotten some insights into the fortunes of a couple of key technology companies as they've reported earnings this week one key insight in particular\nHow many people use their services snap or Snapchat lost two million daily active users in its most recent quarter Twitter so it's active user base jobs the boots more fake accounts will get Facebook's active user account when
