U. T. Austin what voters do here in Spanish language ads can be quite different from what they hear in English\nIn Texas you can see ads for Republican U.S Senate candidate Ted Cruz and English I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message Texas is booming and in Spanish like this ad featuring the centers dad who came to the U.S from Cuba in the late Nineteen fifties\nRomance how 'bout you write about ready to go along a once\nA case that has seen both ads the thirty three year old Austin ... is a computer scientist and bilingual he says the Spanish it seems to take a different tack with the elder Cruz talking about the opportunities America gave him as a refugee and the American dream\nYeah you can definitely see the complete difference right so there is no Taco Bell here's this policy\nHere is is a position is being taken eighties completely emotional\nTalking at the heartstrings has been the playbook for most political ads in Spanish says ... she teaches political science at the University of California San Diego\nA lot of the Spanish language ads are really focused on culture on these emotional messages talking about the American dream and Latinos hanging about family values shared values\nShe worries that Spanish only voters will be left in the dark if these ads only play on emotion and talk less about economic growth taxes or health care\nIf you designed Spanish language ads that are meant much more policy continent English language that than Spanish speaking voters are not getting the same kind of information that monolingual English language from that\nA third of all eligible voters in Texas and California are Hispanic and their numbers are growing in many states across the country many of those households speak predominantly Spanish the Democratic party did spend some cash this week to galvanize the Spanish speaking vote\nBut overall is spending on Spanish language ads going through the roof answer that question is not really that's Armando ... he runs in LA marketing for him and used to help craft TV ads in Spanish for Republican candidates\nHe says we will have a clear picture of exactly how much has been spent on Spanish ads until after the midterms we do know that spending during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign was less than three million dollars down from twenty million ten years before as a loser thinks eventually they're going to be a tipping point\nWhere a large part of the electorate every single year but we're still political parties still under invested that average\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads in English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish the recording one more and just requires another take not really a heavy investment the real cost to both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at\nYale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish the major cost\nAnd this is why I think we don't see more candid and doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person\nWith the Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to bristle that adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture ... says the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish in a community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be the sort of thing that works better when you can target at the individual level like almond advertisements\nYou're online behavior which you search for and what you read tells a politician more about what language do you prefer than yours if code does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook feed\nThan what's on your TV [noise] in Austin, Texas ... for market fresh [noise]\nAll the times to start a new job running one of the biggest financial companies\nIn this economy one would imagine that October two thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the Andrew Dell right so ... did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well that and you're walking in the program\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together or as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do to the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more the result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Austin", "day": "31"}
