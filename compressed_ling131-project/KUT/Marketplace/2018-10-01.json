stay in control of travelling\nLess and less ... learned more in western dot com [noise] and then by Drexel University Drexel University is academic model prepare stationary leaders to address the challenges of a changing world morning ... dot edu slashing vision can't wait [noise]\nIn Washington DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us and we start today with NAFTA or rather than deal to replace it\nNight after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reached that United States Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president last unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... alright manufacturing powerhouse and that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs there at the center of the rhetoric trickle of everything and the and and where a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars of trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current bill or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever you have to set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I'd take away your phone right we say that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico\nWhere it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession you might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain and finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and this bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm noncompliance\nI might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour to fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percent of each vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what a company's doing wages go push up well sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money sometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in more software and more robots more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and\nThe cost of automation goes down\nThere is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly take 'em all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a ... ... what's your and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's I'm a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America [noise]\nAnd and just sitting here in D.C today what are the chances that song get approved by Congress\nWell good luck with your predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal that this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history question for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that Ted mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A. the White House says the agreement is a quote we in for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome that\nThings will be glad to be here All right so based on what you know so far hum how does this do you look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taken away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think that people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nUh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico hit a sub wish to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the in the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship already sailed\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were impose\nThat movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nThat does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us and our businesses um both hops in Apple's this looks a lot like or what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to see\n'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a that we've pulled out of the more of these types of deals would be very welcomed by most of us and in our industries\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your crops or is that still an issue for you\nYeah it absolutely is labor in our part of the country appear a farm labor is is still a somewhat scarce for us and many other employers in this region\nA worm extensively using the each tree a guest worker visa program to help me our labor needs and there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right\nNow that would make some positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress is ready to act on it\nPatrick Smith from Loftis ranch is good to have you back on the show great thankfully\nIf you have questions about this revised trade relationship between the U.S Canada and Mexico or many trade questions and general we'd love to answer them\nLeave us a note at marketplace dot org and there you can read more about economic winners from today's announcement on Wall street today the markets loved that trade news detail when we did the numbers [noise]\nWe have the latest chapter today in this saga that is ... and his relationship with Tesla the company he cofounded he's giving up a little bit of control over it that's the upshot of a settlement the electric carmaker reached over the weekend with the securities and Exchange Commission", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Austin", "day": "01"}
