Wells Fargo and they'll all report earnings and now it's not in that sort of this ah because they will get some hard data to base decisions on and so things could go out especially if companies are doing well and the fundamental like strong\nWhich companies are and the fundamentals have been strong right I mean we have to admit that right jobs are growing the economy is growing so the underlying reality is something that said as I've been hearing what else to go on the market beat today Thanks thank you\nAll right so we will turn now to three snapshots from the president of the United states three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words I don't want the Federal Reserve has been doing with them namely as marketplaces Mariel cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if you are counting and we are and so is the president\nWhich gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background noise\nThen this this morning from a call he made to Fox and friends\nYou know the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] and it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe there\nSo if you're a business and economics journalist what do you do with that because the president is just wrong the fed is not\nCrazy or cute or stringent the central bank under both its current and the media to pass cheers has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero also by the way when an ashtray pal back in July if it bugs him when the White House pumps them in the eye on monetary policy\nOr whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here that\nI had a great a colleague in mentor back in a day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying\nLet's control of control so\nBut we control as long as what we do what we do and and I just told you what we do and we're always going to do that's who we are it's always who we are going to be we're we're going to we're going to do our business in a way that's strictly non political without taking political issues into consideration\nAnd that you know carries out the mandate Congress has given us a we have the tools to do that we have a statute that allows us to do that in in a way that is independent of political considerations\nI'm strongly committed to it and so on my colleagues\nSo where does all this going well there's a mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets tumbling rates rising the fed doing what it's doing the president doing what he's doing it all anchored all of it in the knock on effects of one economic reality whose name\nIs inflation the fed as we told you would like to see prices rising by about two percent a year we got some new inflation numbers this morning and marketplaces Kimberly Adams has more on what they may or may not me\nThe consumer price index tracks prices for a basket of goods and services and I'll just it was that a tenth of that ... percent landing at two point three percent year over year inflation\nIs at a moderate level it's very close to where actually the Federal Reserve would like to see it\nIn LA and teaches economics at Hamilton College I think that it's an endorsement of their\nCurrent plan to continue to raise interest rates very gradual late\nBut numbers are funny you could use those same CPI numbers to make a different arguments economist or need to desk he at every court ISI sums up the counterpoint\nThe fed has a two percent inflation target these numbers are close to two percent why on earth would be be raising rates\nShould ask he says the fat isn't just looking at where inflation is now it's looking at where it's headed plus nothing isn't all that attached to CPI\nMain piece of data they look out for their inflation target is a different price in later called P.
