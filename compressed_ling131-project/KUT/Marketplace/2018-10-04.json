{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "In Los Angeles uncommon result is Thursday I was going to have you on\nEverybody this has been a day of big numbers on Wall street most of them printed or displayed on screens anyway in red ink triple digit losses on the Dell one point eight percent drop on the NASDAQ\nBut we are going to get going with a technically smaller but arguably more revealing number than either of those to the yield on the ten year treasury note the benchmark ten year I should add sits right now at three point one nine percent that's the highest that you'll the interest rate that that bond pays\nThe highest it's been since two thousand eleven we've gotten marketplaces re British or on the phone from New York to talk all things bonds and put this into context they break\nHey they're packed so look I was listening I think actually was you yesterday on the marketplace morning report giving me a the yield on the ten year it was three point zero nine so here we are almost thirty six hours later it is a ten percent higher percentage point higher what gifts [noise] okay so\nGenerally speaking this is happening because the economy is doing great now why specifically yesterday\nI mean like if it's like if you're trying to push a car out of a ditch why did it suddenly move that second you know but one reason could be that there was a very good number I'm I have some index of non human non manufacturers service industries that was a record high yesterday\nBut generally you know you have a low unemployment remote nine percent of GDP Growth rate revised working two percent second quarter this\nAll this great news and it just keeps on piling up and piling up\nA means that a investors could be thinking that inflation is coming okay so innocent place was going to be actually come and we also saw an oil prices rise are rising right sort of thing and pushing coming\nThen that could eat into their long term investment at ten year treasury the long term investment so they're going to need to hire you all the other thing is that uh this could be telling us that investors believed the fed is going to keep on keeping on raising great ... right in ... and so that influences like\nWhich is which is what your caller talked about and we'll get back then we'll get back to ... but let me ask you to sort of I think related questions the first is what does what do rising American interest rates mean in a global economy we have talked about emerging markets on this program for some of the problems are having to me to give me the frame it well the better\nThings are doing here the more\nMoney this is going to suck out of the riskier parts of the world so you know petty turkey and pity Argentina right um you know if you're an institutional investors are out in the world and you were just looking just scrape and for the bottom of the barrel for somewhere to put your money\nYou know you were playing around with turkey plan aren't Argentina player of these other places\nIn the veteran you already been 'cause scraping 'cause that's risky over there right that's the\nDeal yeah exactly it's risky yeah it's super risky financially unstable lots of political problems you know and and so yeah the roads are things are here people are like I'm just going to I'm going to put this money back in the U.S that hurts those countries currencies\nOkay but if I have been living on a my savings account interest rates and my ah certificates deposit interest rates which for a decade now have been ... basically isn't there's admittedly small pickup word a sign of hope [noise] yeah it is\nYes that's right savings account or returns are going to go up that's a that's exactly right now on the other hand so is your credit card rate so is your mortgage it's not a surprise that the thirty year national average mortgage rate is also in a multi year high jump in with this tenure bond a yield so above them\nRight uh back to Jay pal super quick we got a half a minute I'm he sits there the chairman of the fed does and he sees the bond market reacting in the way that in theory he wants right he wants a he's been raising rates and he wants this to keep picking up what do you think he's been getting good\nGrades that's what I Want that's what should happen everyone's getting the message a and also it's happening while the economy is doing great so right now if you know so it's working out which\nIs even better so we better shore in New York talking bumps thanks very\nShort right talked too soon it's going to be interesting to see what happens by the way with those bond yields tomorrow morning\nSay all eight thirty or so east coast time when we get the September unemployment report best guesses are can be pretty good lots of new jobs a new low low rate on unemployment which becomes a big deal when you think about this we're getting old so close to the holiday hiring she's writing given the strength of the economy that debris was just talking about\nHoliday sales are expected to be pretty strong too which means Georgia gonna be busy which means\nThey're going to have to be hiring show what it would be employer to do in the search for those new hires marketplaces Justin how has that one\nYou don't have to tell stories that workers are hard to come by jak Klein hands with the national\nRetail Federation says just look at when retailers are posting holiday jobs this year\nThey're announcing these openings much earlier than what we've seen in the past he\nSays stores are starting to raise wages to attract seasonal workers they're also offering incentives like signing bonuses additional training and more employee discounts\nI Believe one of the companies out there was even thinking of providing a four one K.\nBut even though the unemployment rate is so low there are still plenty of people willing to take on more work seasonal workers are often people who are working second or third job as economists treats like Hillary do she at the new school she says stores no that higher wages will bring in people who need the extra income\nIs really no such thing as a labor shortage in economics higher pay\nCould cut into profits for retailers and gift buying more expensive for shoppers but look these are good problems to have the national Retail Federation said holiday sales are expected to jump by more than four percent this year [noise] economists Sarah house at Wells Fargo says workers are benefiting to\nDecide this week with Amazon increasing their minimum wage the target and Walmart increase the level that they're bringing in workers'\nShe says retailers could ask employees to work longer hours instead of bringing more people on that would be good for existing workers if they need those hours bad for shoppers you'd have to wait in long lines at the checkout counter with fewer employees around New York I'm Justin how for marketplace\nOn Wall street today well we did that right well have the details when we do the numbers\n\n\nThere's been an interesting day in the U.S China economic relationship a big story and Bloomberg Businessweek
