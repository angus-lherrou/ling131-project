President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents source initially we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help the Republican Party and the germs and\nI'm not sure who knows right before we sat down here to tell an ounce and it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so ... had the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment slow we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not to like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from this tax cut actually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot\nWhich is an indicator that and maybe things aren't going as well as a as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow\nAnd and it it also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react preachy badly to Joe I enjoy the ...\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far into this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now that that when we haven't seen for very long time [noise]\nYes I and it's really interesting because that the president has taken a lot of credit only seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor is when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really have a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock market they're not particularly good indicator absolute of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past year\nAnd these are mad at falls like thousand other points that I mean it just ugly yeah and of course Trump usage weight that if that happened to president should be fired there's entirely Obama administrator there's ...\nThere's a tweet for everything that you get the last word he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and Jay Powell basically saying everything's fine we're going to keep raising rates everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat\nSo there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data and the stock market should not be something that he's worried that in fact he what the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubble\nOh somebody's phone went off seriously you go you've been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio Lopez's
