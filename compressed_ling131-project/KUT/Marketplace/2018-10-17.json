the six months of saving so I'm not much worried about that\nDepends on how severe the recession might be [noise]\nI feel like I'm both of our jobs or jobs that won't disappear\nI think that we do okay um I Would I Would hope so he plans for the worst and hope for the best we have always um built a cushion and always tried to pay down debt\nI feel somewhat prepared because I recognized that my

shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back\nIn two thousand seven we are now dependent upon China and how do you get tough on your banker thing is
