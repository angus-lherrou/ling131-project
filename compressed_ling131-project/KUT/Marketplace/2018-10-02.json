second it's good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bays those act\nAs in Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nWell Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWaiting kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour say you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid possessions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers and average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large city\nThat's of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as\nWal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly\nThere are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nAnd their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets a would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred and fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy\nThat's good in general for growth um we also kind of want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail ... teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much thanks any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex Harris\nIs twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I'll just tell me it's just a permanent job for a mouse but actually like fucking like every week or more than that will be alert so much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we hadn't bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with and being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just off last year at a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some way was an enormous all\nWhile cities like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fight for Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take\nThem out of say go for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny try saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers\n\n\nThe new NAFTA or as it's officially known the U.S Mexico Canada agreement reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nThat's because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade deal could delay the time it takes for cheaper generic to get to market\nFrom Washington marketplaces Scott tongue reports\nBiologic drugs are complex medicines made in living cells they ... him into suppressants inflammatory perspective and very pricey\nThis trade deal would give biologic makers ten years of patent protection Canada and Mexico which is longer than they enjoy now Ryan pop or his action for trade representative pharmaceutical makers and others\nNot entirely up to what can the United states but I think the industry this is a real when\nA when because it would fend off competition from generics for a few extra years then of course means a loss for makers of lower price ... similar in Canada they'd have to wait an extra two years to get to market\nKeeping prices high says Jim key on of the Canadian generic pharmaceutical association says some us biologic drugs make a billion dollars every year in Canada\nFor what you could introduce a bar somewhere effectively market could be hundreds of millions of dollars just on that one particle\nThere could be another plus year for us biologics makers using this trade deal to protect its monopoly period here at home which is twelve years law professor ... is with Santa Clara university\nIf they are president comes into power that wants to really reduce drug prices and do it by reducing the number here she would also have to potentially break NAFTA\nWhich has been re branded but you know\nWhile the fact that we've got to deal with Canada and Mexico that the ten years makes it harder for estimate that change\nDrug makers saving need that long to develop biological in Washington I'm Scott Tong for marketplace [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Austin", "day": "02"}
