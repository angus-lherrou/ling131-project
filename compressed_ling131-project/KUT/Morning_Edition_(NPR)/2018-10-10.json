Turkey\nBecause she'll gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post says it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into this disappearance this team\nOf Fifteen Saudi men flew into stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the consulate\nThe post is also reporting with those Fifteen men departed stumbled later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this in is stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point is you learn more facts here\n[noise] and uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday as the day of the show these disappearance\nOr the paper a described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence service as identified several of the men some they say are military officers including the special forces member a there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nA Turkish TV meanwhile are airing footage of ... entering that constantly on October second and of a black man leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this symbol that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearched one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious\nAllowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points and that both the planes\n[noise] well that's a all we know based on the information we have so far uh this is going to need some further explanation it's it's not clear why that would be the case\nIt what officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details or one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in that a bone so it was used on the buddy after the murder\n... a bone saw 'em talk of an assassin assassination squad it sounds like\nTurkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that that is indeed was a targeted murder [noise]\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country or I don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet at the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show the disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving\nBut they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up Turkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate uh they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nUh they've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission\nThat we're told could happen as early as today uh there's no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then went eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what what could I mean if if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could this due to the relationship with your country\nIt would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat frayed I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is a beyond the pale of anything\nThat would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah\nAnd the u._s. always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a turkey is media here are kind of surprised at some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration the big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case so far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh Cosby us investigators to join the probe are happening\nUh we'll see anything like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks bitter thanks\n\nThe largest oil company in the U.S is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change there's I'm sure it's done in the\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on his main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nImportant reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on

as we get deeper into fault it's the decline of China's currency the yuan the renminbi if you prefer is down again this morning six point nine to to the dollar but look out for seven to the dollar which we haven't seen the depths of the great recession ten years ago\nAnd started a veteran China watcher Shawn Ryan in Shanghai he's managing director of the China market research group\nChina has manipulated its currency called the rent n D to drop about nine percent in value over the last few months and the government is doing that to offset the ten percent of terrorists that Trump has slapped on about two hundred billion US dollars worth of imports and that's why export\nAre expected to grow about eight point nine percent in September from China and to the United states\nRight so the ten second economics lesson is when China's currency gets weaker each should make Chinese product easier to buy for Americans yet if we go down to the store this Christmas that may not be what we're going to see here in the U.S\nAmerican companies have to buy for Chinese manufacturers it's very difficult for companies like apple to transfer their production from China to other countries so what's happening is higher prices coming out of China are causing higher prices and Walmart and then the dollar store\nShawn Ryan is managing director of the China market research group thank you\nThank you we should note that\nChinese officials deny engineering the currencies declined nor has the U.S label China a currency manipulator numbers the foot sea in London is unchanged dominance

fast to push to scale up a company that you have to be thinking about social impact\nUh yes I think one of the key things is the great companies are thinking about how we transform the world how are we making the world better and that is both upside down south and one of the things that we have a whole chapter on this in the book is that as your scaling really fast as you running this past

I I Would say relatively smoothly meaning Democrats express their concerns or their opposition we take a vote um nobody notices outside of the foreign policy establishment\nThe reason that justice Kavanaugh's confirmation was so fraught um was not the fight over his jurisprudence it was the credible allegations of sexual assault a and the fact that he now will cement a five justice conservative majority a possibly for decades to come\n[noise] Senator Chris Coons a Democrat of Delaware a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yeah thanks so much for your time we always appreciate senator thank you and I want to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson who has been listening to this Hi Mara Hi David some Nikki Haley I'm One of the few members of this administration has publicly disagreed with\nA President Trump ... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure here\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adapt she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly\nShe wants even said that the women who are accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing but uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not as ... you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use maybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop them more independent political brand for herself\nAnd I just ask you more I mean you were listening to senator Coons there that this whole question of how Democrats should approach this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they don't want to be seen as just being anti Trump and nothing else I'm here's a senator who you know post Haley came around to say she's done good things what position at this party and right now\n[noise] well it's waiting to see what position is gonna be after the elections I mean that's the big question going forward\nWill Democrats have more cloud in the Senate will they take the majority well they have more seats will they be able to uh exert more influence on the confirmation process we don't know that yet but what I think senator Collins is trying to explain is on certain things like a Supreme Court justice that changes the balance of power and the court\nThey exert themselves as much as they can and other nominations\nThey approve the president's pick NPR's Mara

Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen has basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could prop up corn prices that have been down thinks of tariffs by other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nHopes to have a completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nA certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision there were also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation sub move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act of the sudden released that the change would produce more pollutants that we've to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change do the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here [noise]\nRight I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the states so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called\nUs MCA as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a I was governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president and she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nHe seemed to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a book for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth that what you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in energy they're more interested in in\nOil Clay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it yeah I think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mentioned faces a political reality state is

have been a person who has been the person to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats are more conservative that we're a state with an aging population and that you know

U. T.\nDot org thanks it's six fifty wind\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in the Nineteen thirties and New York prosecutor brought down lucky in the shower now than it tore his head of the New York myself yeah it made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career in politics\nLess remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster hit by a grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments\nShe did all these things she was a prosecutor for years she was a big how Republican politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas do if people know it because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats Truman it was a presidential candidate was supposed to win in Nineteen forty eight and last but before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nSo Nineteen forty five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore the corrupted district attorney's office will just make no effort to break up organized crime\nSo the governor of New York for the New York has been attorney to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who have never been prosecutors would never get involved with the prosecutor's office which are seen as entirely corrupt so we hired ... what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to be in a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that she became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why you're hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate like it was you know I Know but do we want it to investigated for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a male crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution all these companies are coming in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attacks you actually put together the first evidence anyone who's ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because it was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in proving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way out [noise]\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded Dewey to arrange a police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night\nThey brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the ... to ... there was no one to bail them out\nAnd it was to keep the women and they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses will turn against their bosses with hope to only turn against I'm Lucy on oh enter everyone's surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana were prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with\nWas a woman known as Cokie flow brown researchers noticed Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit or when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Lucy I Know several times discussing that the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently haven't withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times let me interrupt her testimony in order to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on his lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo Cokie flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice because Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team and Louisiana team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your test and when he was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how\nDoes learning this story changed your understanding of New York city and the Nineteen thirties or America the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nOne to take away from it is how similar in a sense America then was to American now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor to look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores and talks about employment discrimination\nThe sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history is that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves there were people who built\nA society a with in the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as the Santa wonderful wives even at a time when so many evidence we're close to them\nStephen Carter is the author of the new history invisible thanks so much it's been a pleasure Steve thank you\nAnd

the Chinese have spent billions on several other ports in Europe and U.S officials are getting worried that China is buying too much political and economic influence in Europe years more now from Joanna Kakissis\nWhen Chinese leaders met in Brussels last year there were protests Tibetans and\nLeakers minorities persecuted by China demanded that the you condemn Beijing's human rights abuses the EU drafted a resolution to do just that but for the first time in recent memory want a new member state refused to endorse it it was greets a Chinese company runs\nIts biggest port\nFormer Greek shipping minister and I got the scoop belief brushed off that connection\nFor this ... ... there are many reasons why your country's careful about condemning or another country I mean does the U.S vote against the interests of the un so Greece also has every right to make a decision based on its own interests\nBut the great decision set off alarm bells and Brussels especially because China now controls ten percent of the European Court volume for Europeans\nI think it was a wakeup call Theresa Fallon is the Brussels based analyst specializing in Chinese maritime investment\nBecause they think of China's so far away it's not a threat to us we can just trade with them but when they're coming closer and closer to them it's a physical reminder that while China might have longer term interest in this region\nTo illustrate she traces the half moon on the table over the Brussels cafe where we're talking about the Chinese\nThey've invested all along the periphery of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like he's surrounded and squeeze it and that way you you have some control and lovers\nChinese shipping companies now hold steaks and at least twelve ... reports including

Knight him says China's just doing what European shipping companies\nDid before them they're building a network of terminals that they can serve each with their ships and so they have more control over a whole network and ditch will use you to operate them and more cost effective\nIt doesn't really look to me like something like a dangers development or something to really worry about\nDutch analysts France Paul fund or putting has noticed another pattern as he studies China's port strategy\nWhat's kosco and and Chinese companies seem to be doing at the moment is to focus most mostly on not the largest European seaports but is somewhat smaller ones and then develop them to become bigger\nHe says smaller airports are easier to invest in the larger ones where everyone wants a piece of

David Greene in Culver City California that are more details are emerging about the disappearance of a Saudi journalist ... in Turkey so gives the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week the Washington Post\nSays it has been told by people with knowledge of the Turkish investigation into this disappearance that team\nOf fifteenth Saudi men flew into you stumble on October second hours before the show was last seen entering the costs with\nThe post is also reporting those Fifteen meant departed stumble later that very same day on flights to Cairo and to do by NPR's Peter Kenyon is following all of this in stumble and Peter what is standing out to you at this point if you learn more facts here\n[noise] and uh well I'd say the main news of the day is this publication in a in a Turkish pro government paper of both the names and photos of the Fifteen Saudi men who police say arrived in Istanbul last Tuesday the day of the show these disappearance\nUh the paper a described them in as an assassination squad and other media are reporting that Turkey's intelligence service as identified several of the men some they say our military officers including the special forces member\nA there's a reported Saudi intelligence officer in there and also a senior forensics expert\nTurkish TV meanwhile are airing footage of ... entering the consulate on October second and of a black then leaving the consulate about two hours later\nA heading to the consul general's residence or there is a report as well that airport security X rayed the luggage of some of the Saudi men as they prepare to leave this stumble that same night\nUh X. rayed them in themselves and reportedly at the request of the intelligence service\nSearch one of the planes one of the two planes they apparently found nothing suspicious allowed it to take off but the focus seems to be on these Fifteen men and what they were doing here\nWhy search one of the two points and that both the planes [noise] well\nThat's all we know based on the information we have so far this is going to need some further explanation it's not clear why that would be the case\nWhat officials are anonymously talking about are further grisly details one tells the New York times that one of the Saudis was autopsy expert in the bone so it was used on the body after the murder\n... a bone saw talk of an assassination squad it sounds like Turkish authorities are are moving towards the theory that this indeed was targeted murder\nYes it certainly seems that the theory they're leaning towards I don't think you can rule out the other possibility that cause Yogi was spirited out of the country\nI don't think either one has been completely ruled out yet at the Saudis of course deny any involvement with the show veep disappearance they claim he left to constantly within an hour of arriving but they say they don't have any video evidence to back that up\nTurkish police are going through their own camera footage this is from the streets outside the consulate they say so far they've seen footage of him going in but no footage of him coming out\nThey've also been invited to search the consulate building with Saudi permission that we're told could happen as early as today there is no word yet I must say an searching the consul general's residence where the black then when eight days ago\nPeter I mean Saudi Arabia and turkey weren't the best of friends right but what could if indeed this journalists were killed on Turkish soil in the Saudi Government something to do with what could the sort of the relationship with your country\nBut it would be a serious blow to relations that were already somewhat frayed I mean there's been ongoing tensions in the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and turkey quite prominently took cut their side so that hasn't helped but this would be on another level completely this is\nA beyond the pale of anything that would have happened and again as you say if it's demonstrated that this happened and the Saudis do tonight completely but it would be a big blow yeah and the\nUS always under pressure to buy something to do more to put more pressure on Saudi Arabia which could grow here\nYes a Turkish media here are kind of surprised as some headlines are showing a little bit of frustration of big ones is quote Trump I don't know anything about the ... case\nSo far there isn't much sign that Washington is exerting pressure on Riyadh\nCause for us investigators to join the probe are happening uh we'll see if something like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter thanks [laughter]\n\nThe largest oil company in the U.

Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing along in which you have one administration developing rules only to the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesman\nLevel and we will say thank you with a K.

I I Would say relatively smoothly meaning Democrats express their concerns or their opposition we take a vote um nobody notices outside of the foreign policy establishment\nThe reason that justice Kavanaugh's confirmation was so fraught um was not the fight over his jurisprudence it was the credible allegations of sexual assault a and the fact that uh he now will cement a five justice

senator\nThat you don't want to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson who has been listening to this Hi Mara Hi David so Nikki Haley I'm One of the few members of this administration has publicly disagreed with a President Trump ... how did that affect your relationship with the White House and and did that play a role it on her departure here\nWell it doesn't seem like it she was very politically adapt she was able to disagree with the president on some things publicly she wants even said that the women who are accusing Trump of sexual misconduct deserved a hearing\nBut uh she managed to craft a political persona for herself was which was as a loyal member of the Trump cabinet but not as sick a fan you know she said she different from him she was tougher\nRhetorically on Russia but that's true of most of the president's national security team compared to him\nUm she did speak out about human rights you just heard senator Coons talk about that but I don't think Nikki Haley was an outlier so much as she was able to use\nMaybe the distance between Washington and New York city a as a way to develop a more independent political brand for herself and can I just ask\nYou more I mean you were listening to senator Coons there that this whole question of how Democrats should approach this president I mean they have a base that they want to fire up they don't want to be seen as just being anti Trump and nothing else I'm here's a senator who you know post Haley came around to say she's done good things what position as this party and right now\n[noise] well it's waiting to see what position it's going to be after the elections I mean that's the big question going forward\nWill Democrats have more cloud in the Senate will they take the majority well they have more seats will they be able to uh exert more influence on the confirmation process we don't know that yet but what I think senator Collins is trying to explain is on certain things like a Supreme Court justice that changes the balance of power\nCourt they exert themselves as much as they can on the other nominations they approve the president's pick improve our

C. American\nFarmers have had a tough go of that recently taking a financial hit for the Trump administration's trade dispute but last night at a rally in Council Bluffs Iowa President Trump made an announcement he hopes will make a lot of those farmers very happy\nMinister I should throw texting apps and all All right that's\nRight [noise]\nWay our unleashing the power of the Fifteen do you know\nCountry all year long\nPresident Trump is referring to his promise to lift certain restrictions on the sale of ethanol in gasoline in order to boost sales and put more money in the pockets of corn farmers\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio was at the rally and he joins us now from Council Bluffs Iowa ... good morning so just lay out for us what President Trump is ordering the EPA to do by lifting regulations on us now\nSo last night the president laid out his intent to extend the sale of all kinds of gasoline called eve Fifteen year round right now selling it in the summer months is prohibited\nYou Fifteen is basically gasoline with Fifteen Percent of it being primarily from corn based ethanol are doing this could crop of corn prices that have been down thanks to terrify other countries imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration's trade war now there is no time table yet from the White House as to how fast this proposed rule change will go into effect but there are\nBooks that have completed before next summer when you know many drivers are hitting the road\nOr certainly there were Iowa Republican politicians at this rally last night who faced tough races next month they were applauding the decision of there are also Democrats in the state who were pleased with this announcement\nAnd so it is it really going to make a difference for Iowa farmers then\n[noise] yeah I think it will but again a lot of it does really depend on the timeline for when it gets into effect when it goes into effect that is\nEthanol is often hailed as being environmentally friendly because it reduces the use of fossil fuels although many environmentalists are posted this particular move by the president can you explain their position here\nWell we use an example of yesterday the national Wildlife Federation says the move is not legally allowed under the clean Air Act a sudden released that the change would produce more pollutants that we've to smog than gasoline alone\nA there are reports that a number of outside environmentalist groups have said that they will sue over any change through the fuel policy so there's that with environmental concerns from environmentalists but I should also add that there is a bipartisan opposition to this move also from US Senators and primarily oil producing states\nI mean you mentioned the political backdrop of all this mid term elections are coming out I mean clearly the president has a political calculus in this can you explain what the political consequences might be here\nRight I'm I mentioned earlier the idea that the president's trade war has been affecting Iowa agriculture in manufacturing in the state so talking about this in Iowa along with this new NAFTA deal or as it's called\nUs MCA as well as other trade deals kind of a way for the president to garner some support for a couple of these races that look pretty close here in Iowa for the mid term that includes a I was governor Kim Reynolds uh she faces Democrat Fred Hubble\nShe was at the event and the president she worked changing plenty of complements with each other\nAlso the Republican congressman who represents this district David Young was also at the rally he faces a tough race as well in the summer youngest said Trump's tariffs were making him nervous and\nYou seem to be walking the line you know when it came to supporting the president but now there's really no question last night the president said of a vote for David is a vote for me\nWhat's the political argument against this myth though you said that there are some politicians who oppose it\nWell certainly the politicians that are opposing it are from oil producing states and so you know they have oil in mind and so a lot of those senators don't want corn ethanol being the future in an energy they're more interested in in oil\nClay Masters of Iowa Public radio thanks so much we appreciate it you think you\nOnly one Democrat voted to confirm Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh here with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia mansion faces a political reality state is getting more dominated by Republicans and he's in a tight race against the state's Republican attorney general Patrick Morrisey\nBut there are doubts about whether supporting Kavanaugh is really going to help matching on election day here's West Virginia public radio they've missed itch\nAs mentioned stood on the Senate floor to cast his vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday protesters yelled shame from the gallery\n\nShow in it and maybe order and\nBy that evening assigned saying shame on mansion hung over mansions office back in West Virginia state Capitol Charleston in the run up to the vote Jamie Miller was arrested while protesting at his campaign office\nMiller who's an artist also went to Washington with a group of sexual assault survivors to meet with mansion she says he was a tenant and listen to their concerns but after last weekend's vote she's not sure what you do when election day\nI didn't vote for him um during the primary but I have voted for him in the past and now I'm really on the fence about what to do turn Ireland is a Charleston city councilwoman she says she's always recognized that mentioned is new liberal but his defended him in the past I have been a person who has been the\nPerson to say to someone\nThat we need to recognize that West Virginia Democrats\nAre more conservative that we're a state with an aging population\nAnd that you know Joe mansion is better than his opponent\nBut after Kavanaugh's confirmation Arlen so she won't vote for mentioned in November and when we come came to a similar decision she's a public school teacher even the west Virginia Public school teachers went on strike earlier this year and the teachers union support mansion come or social leave her ballot blank\nI absolutely will not be voting for senator mansion in November I won't be voting from Patrick Morrisey either I Would never vote for him but um I just we don't have a candidate and that is going to fight for us\nAll three woman so they hope the next Democratic Senate candidate from West Virginia will be more progressive the mansion he frequently breaks ranks with his more liberal democratic colleagues in the Senate from I ... that voting record is a sign that

T. it's eight fifty one\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin in the Nineteen thirties or New York prosecutor brought down lucky the shall now than it tore as head of the New York myself yeah\nIt made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career in politics less remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster it's by her grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments\nShe did all these things she was a prosecutor for years she was a big power Republican politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas Stewart people know it because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats true but it was a presidential candidate who was supposed to win in Nineteen forty eight and last but before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nSo Nineteen forty five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore is a corrupted district attorney's office will just make no effort to break up organized crime so the governor of New York\nForce than you're just an attorney to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who have never been prosecutors would never it involved with the prosecutor's office which was seen as entirely corrupt so we hired what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice Carter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to me and a time of such prejudice that first that your grandmother became a lawyer that you became a successful lawyer and then that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\n[noise] we don't know exactly why you're hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate what can we see on ... but do we want it to investigate it for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a male crusader wow\nAnd Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired she was banished in a sense to the for the cubicle in the special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods\nTurned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution all these mice are coming in and they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says\nThere's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation but she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attacks you actually put together the first evidence anyone who's ever had the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nSomething like that once she began together the evidence she persuaded do we go to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the Sixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out\nVideos to keep the women's they would turn against the fixers then to pressure the fixers so they would turn against their bosses who turn against their bosses hope to only turn against a Louisiana enter every one surprise\nUnisys idea worked wow and how did the trial turn out\nThe trial was actually a lot of fun for the press precisely because the main witness was against Louisiana were prostitutes and one of them for example the one the press had the most fun with\nWas a woman known as Cokie flow brown ... she was known as Cokie flow was because of her cocaine habit uh when she arrived on the witness stand to testify that she'd overheard Lucy on several times discussing with the prostitution business with his aides\n[noise] she was so jittery apparently having withdrawal not having had a fix in several days that the judge three times what interrupt her testimony in\nOrder to have a sip of brandy ... to calm her nerves\nAnd finally the defense counsel that as Lucy on those lawyer\nDemanded that she be tested for drugs to see whether she was high during her testimony\nSo kooky flow was taken to another room with a couple of doctors and Eunice Eunice was the only woman on the prosecution team in Louisiana team had no women so she was there when the doctors examine term return to pronounce that she was a drug free and the jury obviously believe your testimony was the jury voted very quickly to convict [noise] so how\nLearning this story changed your understanding of New York city\nThe thirties or America the Nineteen\nThirties [noise] one to take away from it is how similar in a sense America's done was to American now my grandmother was on the commission was appointed by the mayor look into the causes of the New York city riots of Nineteen forty five which began in Harlem\nAnd the commission's report if you read it today it sounds like it could be written today it talks about mistreatment of black men by police it talks about suspicion of black people as they go into stores are talks about employment discrimination all the sorts of things that people talk about today but at the same time I think part of our forgotten history\nIs that there were people who are against all odds in that era and even earlier made really remarkable lives for themselves there were people who built\nA society are with him the segregated world in which they could live and move and have their being as a fan of wonderful lives even at a time when so many evidence we're close to

S. is encouraging attacks on the very products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil have announced that the company will contribute one million dollars of the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg Bernal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil supportive tax on its main products\nHurdles and says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile since says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nHurdles and says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but Weber says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it are Republicans today to embrace any new tax difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Austin", "day": "10"}
