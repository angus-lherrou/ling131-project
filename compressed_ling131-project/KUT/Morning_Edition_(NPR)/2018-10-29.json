Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador good morning\nGood morning Steve I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing cures Stevie ... jak humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things are urging people to winter in compliance with immigration law to Mexico and then ... offering refugee status\nTo all those people from Central America to request that including health services education and an identification what the Mexican Government want to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the end to follow Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have been trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against authority even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee status or police there seem to uphold our laws\nThere are ... of the human rights commission and ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police has acted appropriately but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced you\nOffered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seemed from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with\nA sign of well out of ah the the number that we have a ... a thousand five hundred people\nAre out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a percent that a request for refugees that this\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact end up requesting to stop those because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's more of that song of the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's still there around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand a mention of or fire no regional coastal five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugees that\nAre just as important in front of us perspective and bastard because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell some of them are cheerleading tend to get to the U.S and we have coast corporation where U.S authorities to handle this\nIn the best possible way but I Do have to save that the official figures of the people that are still in the Caribbean such is around three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps and around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and the ... the situation continues to evolve\nAnd uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and asks appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crises in our hands but we want to assure that a D.C scandal that

Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo that to conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a\nA passion for the right wing extremists on all sides get embolden when white supremacists get embolden then they turn to action and at the plate of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting\nA mobilized on the march for our lives and have been working on this upcoming election and they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught but bends towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe deeply in the power of this country to overcome all of the evil forces that would bring us down my grandma Fannie came here when she was sixteen years old from Russia\nOr as a sixteen year old migrant and refugee with nothing and she came here because she knew that America would it be the land of opportunity for all people and I I Do believe that that statue of liberty\nMeant something to her and is inspirational to us today\nRabbi joined up has no director of the religious action center of reform Judaism um thank you so much\nWe\nGo next to California's Central valley it's an agricultural region the source of half the fruit nuts and vegetables eating in America\nAnd also home to congressman Devin Nunes but act policy is not what drives his national profile the Republican who was seeking reelection is chairman of the house intelligence committee known for his defense of President Trump and criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller NPR's Tim Mak has more\nIn twenty sixteen Devin Nunes has won reelection by thirty five percentage points now the East German Republican is aimed for the tightest race of his political life pulse taken in the last few months suggests it could be a single digit race\nHe made a decision that he can pretty much what he won and ignore local concerns if he just nationalize All right\nThat's ... a Republican who runs the swamp Accountability Project and his opposing unit as part of her organizations effort to protect Mueller's Russia investigation the big question in this race is whether a congressman can run primarily on national stature well paying little attention to local issues\nHe's national profile is a double edged sword though he's raised a tremendous amount of money Nunez his unwavering supportive Trump has put a spotlight on him that he's never had before\nIn the district constituents care deeply about agriculture immigration and water but ... has spent much of his time focused on criticizing Muller and blocking additional investigations into potential Trump Russia ties\nWith Russia issue is relevant in so far as uh it takes away the political capital that he has known to Washington to focus on what people care about here\nThat's known as his opponent Andrew Janz who says he's the one who can give local representation to the district\nI think that this rate is about taking back the Central Valley\nJammed says received about twenty percent of his campaign funds from outside his state according to open secrets newness has received more than half of his money from outside California mayor who lives in Virginia received a fundraising appeals from noon as California congressional campaign and provided NPR a copy\nRead your generous contribution from Virginia is exactly what I Need right now to push back on the constant attacks and the radical left\nMeanwhile newness has also been hard to reach for ordinary constituent he is not held a town hall since before the last election even Michael demand you will junior a prominent Nunez supporter and a local business leader told NPR that he disagreed with this\nI think public officials should be should be accessible to their situations um are no he doesn't ... personally doesn't enjoy that environment much um I think though the hostility directed him from around the country has made it a lot easier for them to say no to do in these\nNeither known as his campaign nor his congressional office responded to an interview request\nAnd when NPR tried to visit his taxpayer funded office in the most populated region of his district it was closed an staffed at two pm on a weekday phone calls to that office go straight to voice mail the only other office in that district is a forty five minute drive away\nAnd so one of the criticisms that constituents saying he's not a class war\nThat's Lisa Bryan that professor at Fresno state which is in the district\nI think if you are and loyal constituent and or a donor to his campaign that he ... he does you know fundraiser dinners and things like that however it as a regular constituent you want to go to his office and he just somebody staffer in his office um it's very difficult\nWhile he's not holding public events he's blanketing the airwaves with attack ads and even producing\nAlternative under the new to move them to my very first month\nNunez even picked a fight with his local newspaper the Fresno Bee\nThe bees editorial board declined to endorse him for the first time in sixteen years after he refused to meet with them\nIn an unprecedented move newness produced a forty page high end glossy magazine that suggests that the newspaper is after him because of their suppose it communists sympathies his supporters are with him on this here's your manual again\nI mean I was in the valley my whole life except for six years there are stopped taking the paper the ship\nIs a unique strategy in this contentious mid term cycle so well known as has traditionally posted to victory his views on Russia and the president may make for a nerve wracking election night if a blue

U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D.\nOne on than we are online at UT ...\nIn this hour the neighborhood where a gunman opened fire I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep also this hour how did a medical test for allergies costs more than forty eight thousand dollars and wanting to photo ID voting rules mean for people who are transgender Monday October twenty nine today in two thousand twelve when Superstorm Sandy came ashore in New Jersey the devastating storm was seen through a partisan lens\nA Republican governor was criticized for cooperating with a democratic\nLoses next\nOr who are really struggling with a how to make sense of what had happened um and I think the message to them was to double down on our commitment to love and to a as Dr King said I'm not trying to drive out hate with hate only love can do that\nAnd you know David want you to remember that this massacre was perpetrated by a person who is not only anti Semitic and hated Jews but he targeted this synagogue because they had had refugee ship but they were working with highest which is a historic Jewish Agency that are resettled refugees from all over the world not just Jewish refugees Muslim refugees Christian refugees\nAnd it was a commitment to synagogue had made to welcome asylum seekers and migrants and so I think the message is we as Jews look outward and welcome all people with love and open arms and we're going to continue to fight for the widow and a stranger and the orphan and all those who are suffering in our midst\nI just think about this I mean it's been more than a year now since Charlottesville and the unite the Right rally in and there were people infamously chanting Jews will not replace us I'm now we have this uh what what are you learning in these moments about anti Semitism in the United states of America\nLet's not forget David that in Charlottesville\nAre not many people don't remember that that same morning three of those white nationalist neo Nazi thugs stood outside the local synagogue in Charlottesville with assault rifles threatening so what we saw as threatening of gun violence a year ago has now become a massacre with gun violence\nSo the two conclusions I draw our that words matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters and when the right and the kind of a\nA ... to the right wing extremists on all sides get embolden when white supremacists getting bold and then they turn to action and at the plate of gun violence in our country this is what the students were outraged about these are the same students who after the Parkland shooting\nA mobilized on the march for our lives and have been working on this upcoming election and they in tears said to me rabbi has nothing changed since Parkland and I had to reassure them that the arc of history as long as Dr King taught but bands towards justice\nAre you optimistic that we can grow from this I Believe deeply in the power of this country to overcome all of the evil forces that would bring us down my grandma Sammy came here when she was sixteen years old from Russia\nOr as a sixteen year old migrant a refugee with nothing and she came here because she knew that America would it be the land of opportunity for all people and I I Do believe that that statue of liberty meant something to her and as inspiration\nUs today rabbi Jonah ... director of the religious action center of reform Judaism um thank you so much\n\nThere is a trend far more Democrats are describing themselves as progressive these days than they did four years ago there are strategic reasons candidates are bracing mislabeled but one major reason as NPR's of ... report could be that the word is flexible it can mean different things in different states\nTo reverse is not a fiery liberal demanding free college for all he's a soft spoken bureaucrats and a former teacher in school administrator now running for governor in Wisconsin trying to prevent the Republican Scott Walker from winning a third term even talks a lot about improving basic\nPublic services the people was going to care whether the roads are safe care whether they have a good education and care about having\nAccess to health\nBedrooms for us it was\nEven has a habit of calling himself a progressive they even in his ...\nThe rest of it as a means to me solving problems that people have been looking at a Democrat\nBut he was never the most liberal candidate in Wisconsin primary and at a recent rally he had with Bernie Sanders some Democrats in the crowd like doing fair weather we're not exactly sure if they would put Sanders fevers seems I\nYou say\nEven though he's trying to do is tapping distinct Wisconsin version of progressive politics the state has had a long tradition of economic populism and he goes is that we even campaigns talking about Medicaid expansion and a Fifteen dollar minimum wage\nAnd we're going to give every middle class\nFamily in a state of Wisconsin at ten percent break on their income taxes because\nThose are the people that have been struggling all along Scott\nEven vision of progressive politics is about standing up to big business and ensuring average people get a voice in government and hundreds of miles to the south in Florida there's another guy running for governor who shares this concerns about the economy and Medicaid expansion\nWe talk about health care and access to health care to me there's nothing you know out of the mainstream about folks getting access to life saving medicine\nAndrew Gillum is thirty nine year old mayor of Tallahassee trying to become Florida's first black governor his campaign style is nothing like even his supporters like to say that he is an apology medically black and charismatic\nEven is on the other hand is described as bland and even by his supporters Galen like even his talks a lot about the economy and the need to campaign it read parts of the state where Democrats don't usually go\nBut wait even is cautious and careful around culture war issues like immigration or guns and for sizes those very same things and he's repeatedly spoken about the need to take on the n._r._a.\nI realized that the status quo of our party and maybe even the status quo politics says that those are you know lives by which you have to stay away from if you want to win in a state like mine but I think our primary race really blew that to shreds\nGillum also wants to repeal the state's controversial stand your ground law the law gives Floridians the right to act in self defense even to the point of using deadly force\nAnd in my state where I live the law is such that you can go antagonize pushed the bay or start a fight and then hide behind stand your ground with somebody responds\nGiven says his own experiences have informed his public policies would give them also does is next progressive politics with race here he is at a recent debate calling out his GOP opponent for accepting money from a donor who falsely described former President Obama as a Muslim and used a racial slur\nNo I'm not holding the defense of races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist [noise] well\nResearch shows that white democratic voters are increasingly likely to describe their political views as liberal compared to a decade ago\nBlack voters not so much what this means is that a

still far from the U.S border\nThe caravan is on Mexican soil and our next guest represents the country with responsibility for just now Iran and we'll go to the artist is Mexico's ambassador to the United states ambassador to morning\nGood morning Steve I Want to begin with the facts here seven thousand or so people which is a lot of people looks like a lot on TV but I Do know it's part of this much larger somewhat ordinary flow of migrants so how serious situation is this the view of your government\nWhat what we're facing here Steve is really a humanitarian crisis the Mexican government response has been basically two things urging be both\nCompliance with immigration law to Mexico and then ... offering refugees stop those\nTo all those people from Central America through requested including ... services education and an identification what the Mexican Government wants to assure is that movement and whatever migration takes place it's legal it's safe and ...\nThe impression from here was that the migrants did not in the fall of Mexicans Mexico's immigration laws there was an effort to stop them at the border with Guatemala and and the and the government more or less let the man is that right\nWe have been trying to avoid at all costs violence in the border unfortunately some of the people in the care of and have been very violent against the forward the even though that they have offered the possibility of entering in compliance with immigration and refugee stops are so police there seem to uphold our laws\nThere's presence of the human rights commission and ... of Mexico and also several NGOs that can testify to the fact that the police cars are that appropriate but nevertheless we want to make sure that our laws are enforced\nYou offered them refugee status I Believe you said and yeah the leader of this group seemed from terrorists Without Borders that is involved in organizing this caravan seemed dubious of that offer and indicated their suspicion that the majority of people who are invited to apply for asylum but ultimately be rejected and deported is that actually what tends to happen with a\nSign of out of the the number that we ... thousand five hundred people are out of those um we have one thousand eight hundred and Ninety five people that have requested a percent that a request for refugees that was\nOne thousand four hundred and thirty five of them are being processed and about a four hundred and twenty two have actually been repatriated to the states so right now it's unclear I think that a lot of them will in fact in requesting to stop this because it's a very generous offer on the part of a Mexican ...\nI'm just going through those numbers first you said thirty five hundred you believe this caravan to be about thirty five hundred people\nYes it's murder that's on all the numbers that have been a a thrown out there that the official number for us it's field around three thousand of them are in the states of ...\nThe carbon was a little bit bigger but I'm Around two thousand I mention of or fire no regional coastal five thousand have already a percent that their request for refugee status\nOr this has important in front of us perspective and best or because you're saying the caravan of smaller than reported and it's getting smaller over time as some of them except refugee status there aren't actually that many people heading for the U.S anymore\nWell some of them are purely inning tend to get to the U.S and we have coast corporation where your support these kinds of this in the best possible way but I Do have to save up your official figures of the people that are still in the guard about such\nYou sir I'm three thousand five hundred a little bit less perhaps an around two thousand of the original group have already requested a refugee status in Mexico and the ... the situation continues to evolve\nAnd uh obviously being monitored by Mexican authorities and appropriate in coordination with U.S authorities again we want to assure\nWe have a humanitarian crisis in our hands but we weren't too sure that these is can vote that migration is scandal legally safe and ordered\n... thanks very much

U. T. held a series of candidate forums earlier this month\nThat included one for the mayor's race\nThe hour long for um withheld last week at Wesley United Methodist church in east Austin today we'll hear part of that form with incumbent mayor Steve Adler and former city councilmember Lara Morris and we'll start with a question about the city's recently scrap land development code rewrite called code next\nWe asked Adler what went wrong and what's next where\nWe have to rewrite the land development code to thirty or document it's been amended money times and\nAnd while it is not the answer to affordability and to transportation and gentrification or we're not gonna be able to answer those questions without redoing the code of sort of somebody who has to get done\nOr we pulled back from a process will carry for the things that that were developed in that process that are that are good\nBut there was a process that wasn't going to get us to a consensus you know I went into too many parts of the city\nUh where where I'm a people were which said to me or we do\nA here's a picture of of a judge for ... years a picture of flooding in my neighborhood\nOr here's a picture of families moved out of my neighborhood uh this is why I don't support her next and I look at them and I would say you know if you have a picture of it it's not code next to this code now ah and and\nWhen I Would go into neighborhoods in half the neighborhoods and the city uh there were significant number of people that were telling me the code next wasn't going to be able to move forward or shouldn't because it was\nThe product of greedy or developers there were out to just put money in their pockets but I Would go to another set of neighborhoods and they were told me that shouldn't happen because it was being pushed by racist ... in our city and the truth is that neither of those were true\nI think that really the the the vast majority of people in the city we would have been able to reach consensus on a on a process which has worked out next was and I still think we're going to be over to get there but we need a process that people are going to be able to trust the fuel or they were heard\nOr we've gotten a lot of work done and I believe that the city will be able to pick it up and and move it forward but but we have to come up with a process that will\nGet us across the finish line and the one that we have is not going to get us there\nLaura you have blamed the undoing of code next unquote advisors failed leadership what do you think went wrong and how should off the handle of rewrite of its land development code going forward [noise]\nUm yeah I was on the city council only kicked off this process to redo the land development code and we were very clear on some priorities and processes that needed to be followed\nTo be able to be a a really achieve the goals that we had\nUm and unfortunately those priorities and those a process these\nWere abandoned for instance in terms of priorities\nWe worked really hard to get this priority and imagined nonsense that when we rewrite the land development code one of the priorities has to be the families will be able to remain in their homes and you know right out of the block the is the first generation of ... was protecting over a hundred thousand people would be displaced the next ten years\nThe other part of it is the the process is we were very clear that it was supposed to be a community driven process we knew that there were going to be controversial issues and so we put pieces in place\nThat would like for instance required that they bring forward alternatives for a public discussion on the controversial issues\nSo that they could be settled before spending eight and a half million dollars and having to scrap it so I'm In my view it needs to be communities driven it needs to really settle on the priorities and ensure that it helps the city grow stronger\nA and not just a remake and displaced people\nUm and in terms of where we need to go from here\nI'm a you know that there has been so much trust that's been broken with city hall over this process because people weren't heard uh when they raise their concerns\nSo I think that we need to break down that that that targets on where we want to accommodate growth and how much we need to accommodate growth and how we're going to achieve affordable housing or in the different districts and\nReally work with the community on how to achieve those targets because the folks that are on the ground that community those closest to the issue is the one best suited\nTo come up with uh the the solution [noise]\nLast year the Austin city council adopted the Austin strategic housing blueprint which specifically includes affordable housing goals for each council districts including that ten percent of rental units in each district to be affordable to families of for making less than twenty six thousand dollars a year\nAnd we'll start with the mayor on this question\nHow would you convince neighborhoods that have little affordable housing to buy into this mandate\nMy sense is is that in this community at this time the the good will\nA and the desire to create mixed income opportunities in all parts of our city is is something that is widely held\nIts not held that way by by everyone in the city which is why we certainly have some nimby interests and then folks that are that want this challenge to be met in areas uh other than their own\nBut I'm convinced that as I go around the city and I've been in hundreds of different neighborhood meetings all over the city\nThat that that most of the residents in most of the neighborhoods genuinely want to make sure that that that everyone has an opportunity to to to be able to live in all parts of our city people recognize that the children that are growing up in mixed income opportunities do better [noise]\nUh all children whether they come from an affluent family or in a family that that does not sharing\nA so I think that one of the most important things to do is just to to help communities to be able to come together to give them tools that they can really used to\nTo to to listen to to how they would replace those mixed income opportunities in in their areas but then also to be strong as it can be to to demonstrate that the community will exist\nAnd I and I think this community has done that in this moving further in that direction\nAnd Laura's question for you I'm with these goals for affordable housing units in every city council district how would you convince neighborhoods that currently have little affordable housing to buy into this idea\nYeah I Know it's been a been a longtime advocate of making sure that we have affordable housing in all parts of town and in fact when I was on the city council ah we want it to make sure that there was really a strong dialogue between affordable housing developers and",
