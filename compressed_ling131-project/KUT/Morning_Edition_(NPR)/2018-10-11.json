comes to an ethnicity pay in the workplace that costs a whole range of industries I think\nObviously we don't know and that's why we want to have these thick as out ... power and see which is similar to what we've had lived agenda we we need the same things but what we have seen so far with the companies that have voluntarily release ethic for example ITN which incorporates I TV news telephone news channel five news\nIs that the gender or the the same pay gap is actually a guy in that instance than it was full the gender pay gap so\nThat that definitely is a significant disparity and something that hopefully these new measures will be able to\nUse that time frame which I'm not able to get so black and minority ethnic yeah that that means\nI'm I have to be careful with is the baby she was doing its best but not very long ago if you want you to find the people of color and the BBC you'd go to the country you know you would get up early in the morning and they'd be cleaning that is changing ... box is that the problem but it's not that it's discrimination on the basis of color but it is that the jobs available\nFor people all low paid jobs\nI mean I think discrimination Yvette discrimination and unconscious bias all based huge practice but\nI'm the issue I think is not gassing people of color in the door it's then getting them to progress through those levels so threes may and her not since they said that a lot of the people of color feel that that hitting a brick wall when it comes to correct progression and\nYou know it's not something I say they also have to agree with three of my own best on this point and I do think\nThat is a huge thing it's not the problem of getting into the building it's then why do we go from that a lot of these um ... apprenticeships schemes leave people of color and languishing kind of on the Baltimore rungs on that isn't that mental shape the support that\nIn belle kind of system to help them what their way

ten days with no natural lie to a way of telling the time\nThat's exactly what a new BBC program did the idea behind it was to try and get a better understanding of our daily rhythms a multi ...\nHow they're definitely feeling the strain [noise]\nDo they know\nShould be renamed the longest in history [noise]\nSmall worry [noise]\nMay actually be [noise]\n[noise]\nWell the female voice you heard that was that about ... she's an evolutionary biologist and presenter of the documentary body clock what makes us tick us other when did you first realize that her subject I'll do was beginning to unravel\nFrom the beginning you could see a shift um and it's cumulative right so every single day he was shifting say the the big thing that we were saying was that he's voting for shifting about half an hour out every single day so\nUm he would wake up half an hour to every single day nuts because he has an accurate but he talks with ... actually most of us have inaccurate body clocks and most of us have a buddy ... slightly known since ... and being twenty four hours that twenty four and a half hours\nAnd and we need light to reset them it's like one of those old wind up talks um and if you're not getting that night you're not getting the reset said he wasn't getting that reset every single day and said he was shifting late night night to every single day\nTo begin with you had some light and then she'll Kuwait the light\nSo he had opposition light down that yes he could control\nThen we took it off him and we we we basically did something called going day and what we called ... which means that we switched off the lights twenty four seven the only thing he had\nWas a constant a ... in the corner and that was on constantly twenty four hours a day again and that was the point like really started to see and struck me\nTo have anything to do because having nothing to do would also add to that yeah lots of time with in the\nDays of really really tough guy and he's a full ... come on day and one of the things he loves doing is working out\nAnd so we gave him a you know he's Jim ... down that but we always have safe in activities today's a seven times a day and that was all benefit for the scientists benefit to see how his um physical strength laws but also how he was protesting things\nAnd you could see the decline of that three time but I kind of go back to the gym kid he had he wasn't enjoying working out anymore which was really unusual for him and say you got to see the deterioration of somebody and within that you get a really good idea of just how important of what he called thought was\nAnd how it's important to understand the impacts of them on a house and the importance of light\nYes yes so this is so crucial we evolved in a time where\nAre you would be outside the law that definitely when you know didn't deal with it is and that you know and and you need to be getting outside you need to find ways of going outside to get natural sunlight\nAnd the other part of it he's in the evening instead of just staying awake by candlelight too by fire which has ... you know we vote full instead when we've\nWe'll be funds with all these ... artificial lights and that he's not good for us\nAnd it but it could all do change going to be tough you know if it's that kind of name isn't it [laughter] I could be unable to sort of um but he suffered\nPut it like Best Buy day nine I was really happy that we would get and came out with that because it's it's actually reading uncomfortable towards somebody for ... yeah it's not fun it's fun and you know it's most people were in that they would have they would have given up much much quicker and he's an adventure he's he's a tough guy\nWhat did we learn for the rest of us who would not go to spend time in a bunk bunker we've know liked\nIt is extreme the truth is almost lives are extreme we did not vote for this up what he talks and not getting the reason that they need to ... we should be taking away how do we need more in sync with ... Koch how do we get that natural light how do we say if you have a job for example way your shift welcome to\nOr if you suffer from jet like the advice that you can get a to improve your situation to improve your health and that's we we kind of look at that as well and so there's a simple thing so uh for example if your shift Wicca you need to be thinking about consistency\nLessons for life from World up to about ... the body clock is a documentary joined us from all wild up due tomorrow\n[noise]\nMorning you're listening to K.

meteorologist before to public radio we really appreciate your time is when Joe how are you are welcome\nThere's a lot at stake in this year's midterm elections Donald Trump's legislative agenda ... ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power and cares national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nI asked veteran democratic strategist Paul the Gallup what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the Gallup the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote six out of left seven presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains that the state level there'll be shut out again without a saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton aide lane Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is\nWinning back some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats have to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really is almost two should life or death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says it's Democrats lose in November their worst nightmares come true and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he couldn't fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the ... and replace them with it for a general who's choosing means the Trump could continue to roll back regulatory productions undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about how taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy big for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's going up some of these agencies how big corporate interests are treated or environmental laws inside out at the very middle protection agency and the Interior Department\nIn addition to investigating called the Gallup says Democrats do also plan to legislate\nIf the Democrats take the house and they pass things that people want like increasing the minimum wage like a child care Bill White controlling prescription drug costs like shoring up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost of premiums well then let the Senate pick it up or not and then you've got something to run on\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto the Gallup says Democrats can set an agenda for the next election and twenty twenty but Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power\nClick and took over the house after President Obama's first mid term that was thanks to the Tea Party movement which wanted instant results\nI can tell you if we weren't contemplating Italy monthly if not more often repealing Obamacare\nThan we were not doing all we could even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself\nCanter says Democrats if they went and we'll have to deal with the same danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nThese constituencies are going to expect abolishing eyes there are going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare for all and at the most extreme they're going to expect the dumber crowd to if they win majority in the house to uh go ahead and pick the ...\nIf the Democrats win the house impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they move quickly to impeach the president that the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nYesterday stock

California\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing Saudi journalist Jim ... he entered the Saudi consulate in Danville is Campbell turkey last week that much we know\nBut he has not been seen since ... he wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll get back to the country\nSaudi officials continue to deny any involvement in the show he's disappearance\nWe're joined now by Karim thinking he's the Washington Post correspondent in ... who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us green\nThanks for having me your reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get him back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so as you say that the U.S is gathered intelligence that\nShowed that the crown prince ordered this operation to lure them from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia and U.S officials told my colleague that intelligence intercepts captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears to confirm\nThat the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seek the silence and uh he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post\nCriticizing some of the monarchies policies including the arrests of women's rights advocates there and the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his appearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the\nIntelligence intercepts obviously under those assertions 'em and they and they really add to the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened right\nSo let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappearance had that conflict could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnapped him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts of race that possibility or you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what happened inside that conflict there is that there is this\nTheory that that what happened inside may have been part of a a\nPlan to capture that somehow withdraw\nSo US Senators have triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but ... how do we find out who was actually leading the investigation to find out\nThe truth is that the Turks is that the U.S are they working together [noise]\nBe you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings\nUm ah when the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn gym but how about the details of the plot that they've discovered and it's also you know been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up this is potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in ... thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy will be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can that places but\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program sure have to do that\nSo the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen at the bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico a traditionally what the us presidents do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump or and or ex Jared Kushner and mom I've been following the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nMeeting with President Bush in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies cause what brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course has the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against\nHurricane micro continues to wreak havoc through the Gulf Coast region the wind was so strong fisheries using here just about every

I mean the u._k. is still a member of the new but it's not the same ... that he was two years ago I think a lot of China has been broken during these negotiations\nA lot of China you describe it like a a divorce but um it's pretty funny um sadly are out of time and have to stop there are a lot of ... is a former diplomat who worked on the breakfast the groceries and thanks a lot\nThank you so much Democrats have a slender path to take in the U.S Senate this fall they need to pick up Tuesday to gain a majority but they also have to defend plenty of states including one in New Jersey where incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez is facing fresh attacks about his federal corruption trial last year\nDo Hernandez from member station W H y y report\nMenendez was fired up as he spoke to a crowd in Princeton New Jersey last month he's cast himself as a foil to President Trump whose approval ratings in the Garden State or in the thirties Jersey and I\nDon't need someone who will stand with Donald Trump they need someone who will stand up to Donald Trump\nContrast that with the Bob Menendez of ten months earlier last November he had just walked out of a federal courthouse in Newark a free man after a judge declared a mistrial and his corruption case those\nNew Jersey of gave me the benefit of that [noise] I think\nJustice Department prosecutors have accused Menendez of taking gifts and trips from a wealthy friend in exchange for political favors\nBut then there's escaped legal trouble but he was officially admonished by the Senate and his poll numbers in New Jersey took a hit and it wasn't long after he announced he would run for reelection that attack ads like beef started appearing on many members\nObama's Justice Department for taking hundreds\nThousands of dollars and improper again and\nNews deserves\nThat ad comes from and then there's his opponent Republican Bob ... a wealthy businessman who's funding his own campaign you can as a marine veteran and a political newcomer who says New Jersey should be embarrassed by Mendez\nEarlier this year she can step down as the head of cell gene uh New Jersey based pharmaceutical company he touts so gene as an example of a drug company that identified the patient need and satisfied it\nSounds as an amazing thing for cancer patients turning multiple cancer from a terminal diagnosis chronic disease but\nCritics say so gene is more like a poster child for high drug costs and shady marketing tactics Menendez has seized on that issue to discredit\nHugo corporate greed looks like drone company ... he's getting a lot he said the more people needed drugs\n... things considered live at four o'clock right here on K U T Ninety point five Austin's NPR station and be sure to check out our full program schedule at K.

radio is six fifty wind\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin the founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers\nAnd when it came to war the draft or is that the constitution did not want that consequential decision in the hands of just one person among them was James Madison presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself\nHe learned that war is can we political benefit Steve Inskeep spoke to bash last about his new book is titled president of war\nMadison was the one who said men are not angels he was so worried of a president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons he was trying to slam the door on that\nBut once he was president and Eighteen twelve he's the one who opened the door to a president go into Congress than saying\nI think there should be a war and if you hadn't had Madison do that it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make were almost single him what was the situation that the United states faced in Eighteen twelve\nThe United states had ships that were being harassed by the British are a lot of Americans wanted to grab Canada so there was a group and Congress is Canada then okay absolutely so they said\nHow about a war and Madison said well you know maybe there is a good rationale for having a war and Madison sort of liked the idea of being a war president himself exactly the opposite of the way he was in Seventeen eighty seven in Philadelphia\nI'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting and what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the perfect way of putting it\nIn Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for re election to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of sounds pretty modern doesn't it\nSo James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in warm making although they're still asking Congress at that point ... go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James Cape ... was a liar and achieve and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war\nWith Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sat American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans and Mexican fought back\nAnd Polk says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico but wait a minute here he's still like to ask\nCongress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why aren't we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted into the future\nOkay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened in Nineteen fifty [noise]\nI Love Truman Steve but he just terrible thing in Nineteen fifty but North Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty\nAnd what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said I had like a war declaration they would have given up to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized and that might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said Truman didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two\nAnd that is totally in violation of the constitution [noise]\nWhat are some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states in World War that is popular your poll ratings were rise\nYou write early in this book\nWhere the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and should grand discovered that in spite of their Arden striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens\nTo get a job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nPresident Trump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president he predicted the President Obama would do that that isn't about he makes the connection between war and politics that the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is ... remarked on the fact that oftentimes if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that if you've been commander in chief during war that is a thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\n[noise] one of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of the average today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation\nAnd specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress it's seen as a serious mistake in foreign policy had left ... out of Syria with much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI think it is always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss is the author of presidents of war the epic story from Eighteen oh seven to modern times thanks so much thanks great to

lot at stake in this year's midterm\nElections Donald Trump's legislative agenda ... ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power and cares national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nI asked veteran democratic strategist Paul the Gallup what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the Gallup the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote out of less than in presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains that the state level somebody shut out again without a saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton aide lane Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is\nWinning back some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats have to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really is almost sushi in life and death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November a former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says Democrats lose in November their worst nightmares come true and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he couldn't fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the ... investigation and replace them with a very general who's choosing means that Trump could continue to roll back regulatory productions undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy bank for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's going up some of these agencies how big corporate interests are turning our environmental laws inside out at the bottom of the protection agency in the Interior Department\nIn addition to investigating called the Gallup says Democrats do also planned to legislate\nIf the Democrats take the house and they pass things that people want like increasing the minimum wage like a child care Bill White controlling prescription drug costs like shoring up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost of premiums well then let the Senate take it up or not and then you've got something to run on\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential detail the Gallup says Democrats can set an agenda for the next election and twenty twenty\nThat Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power when Republicans took over the house after President Obama's first mid term that was thanks to the Tea Party movement which wanted instant results\nI can tell you if we want contemplating Italy monthly if not more often repealing Obamacare\nThan we were not doing all we could even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself\nCanter says Democrats if they win will have to deal with the same danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nThese constituencies are going to expect abolishing eyes they're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare for all and at the most extreme they're going to expect the Democrats who if they win majority in the house to uh go ahead and pay the ...\nIf the Democrats win the house impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they moved quickly to impeach the president but the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea but Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment\nBecause they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nThree journalists at the largest private newspaper in me and my arm have been arrested\nAs came after government officials

S. so they working together [noise]\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they said that they will present their\nFindings um when the time is right um but you know all of this has raised\nQuestions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn about about the details of the far that they've discovered and it's also you know been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held them up as as potentially transformative leader in the middle east [noise]\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in as temple thank you so much thanks\nOkay curry mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can live has happened\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program\n... so the president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't a cat or Mexico a traditionally with us for them to do but a unique\nTo Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel is closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mama than some of the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia\nOr so it ... it would really be tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies caused what brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nThe news you depend on from ... the basic K.

hurricane real historic I mean since Eighteen fifty one our records don't show a category for making landfall before the panhandle ... historic storm catastrophic damage you know you have the\nThe winds associated with such a strong storm\nBut not only that you have the storm surge I mean would you know predicting the potential to nine to fourteen feet of inundation in some areas and that's his that's destructive to end the waves are even on top of that so the combination of the rain the when the storm surge has had every aspect of all the the impacts we expect from a strong hurricane\nRight until you mentioned the storm surge I mean are there are active threats right now to the people who didn't evacuate too who are still in the areas that were hardest hit\nRacial what happens is all that water is forced an because the winds were so strong with the hurricane and you know we were we were talking about this the last three days and how far inland some of that storm surge does it find every every low spots so rivers that normally flow\n'em out to the Gulf like the apple after call a river that flows they've actually reverse that water goes back or to go ten Fifteen miles inland so once it's forced than with the wind now it has to flow out and that takes time so those water levels going to stay high for a little while\nI'm this storm moved quicker\nThan Hurricane Florence any part of the the devastation that sounds that it was so slow moving um but this one seems to come on so fast why was that\n[noise] and it's it's interesting to look at these hurricanes because they're all so different and that's why we try to we spend so much time here at the hurricane center and and talking about those impacts because they're all completely different so foreign stalls\nAnd like a Harvey right in Texas and you're going to Florence that when they ... they could bring an amazing amount of rain flooding dangerous life threatening rain this one was fast so a different impact with a fast one\nIs you know you start getting some of those hurricane force inland we had a hurricane in southwest Georgia last night which is which is staggering and that and that causes a lot of damage as well the other part of this equation is interesting too and you have a Florence\nAnd and you have storms that come across the Atlantic you can see 'em for five six seven days right when they when this time of your typical for October when they form in the Caribbean there's just not a lot of real estate so one once they form and they start moving especially with\nMichael moving you know during the life cycle anywhere from twelve to Fifteen miles an hour to get your quick so those timelines change based on where they form\nAnd you don't have a lot of time to prepare are not as much as we mentioned this thing is is not over it's been downgraded to a tropical storm but it's headed toward the Carolinas um\nThat's right as opposed to cities still it's how\nYou look at the radar here you know we're still have a strong circulation rounded we're still think of us were still a tropical storm or even after all the time for the ... corps\nSo around those rain band you can definitely still get heavy rain flooding rain\nYou can get tornadoes in the brain and the other part that always worries me that you know the falling trees as well because once you've talked with that for all and we're still talking fifty on our Web that'll knock down trees and power lines so you have a dangerous start over people still have to really watch why cause we we move across the Carolinas\nAll right

says you have a lot of time okay you're going to say there is the second reason to think it's actually happening\nI think the second reason is is that up I mean one of the big problems in these negotiations from the beginning has been that it's been taken your case so long to arrive to any position and it's been negotiating just as much much with itself as it has with the new at this summer we actually got this so called checkers proposal from the u._k. prime minister\nAnd when it was the first time that they actually made a a comprehensive package of how they see\nThemselves leaving and what the new relationship could be and although the checkered steel is not acceptable as such I think it was really important that that was a basis for negotiations to go forward so a lot of people\nIn Europe were just telling the u._k. just come up with something so we can get started and actually actually working on something\nConcrete exactly it's been extremely frustrating I think for many parties to ask you about one\nSticking point um there's this determination to avoid a hard border between Ireland which is part of you in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. can you just remind us why that is so important not to have a hard border there\nI think many people in in Europe forget and um how recently actually the real peace settlement was made in in regard Northern Ireland uh this is all about the so called Good Friday agreement the peace agreement between um the u._k. and and the Irish Government\nAnd many of these elements depend on the fact that both areas are part of the few so if you think about free movement of people are good across the border people being able to live where they want a all all of these elements which have to do with the integration of the area and they are about the you\nKnow when when if if when and if Northern Ireland is leaving a there is a real risk a that what is happening underground or like Ken Ken hamper the implementation of disagreement and it can possibly cause a lot of conflict a locally\nAnd among because we just have a few seconds left but I mean there's been talk of maybe a new referendum and the u._k. backing out of of wrecks that if there were vote with that you take Britain back\nThe use I mean the u._k. is still a member of that you are but it's not the same members said that he was two

T. dot org we are Austin's NPR station there'll be your day is getting off to a great start it's eight fifty one [noise]\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin the founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers and when it came to war\nThe draft or is that the constitution did not want back consequential decision in the hands of just one person among them was James Madison presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself\nHe learned that war is can we political benefit Steve Inskeep spoke to bash last about his new book is titled presidents of war\nMadison was the one who said men are not angels he was so worried of a president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons he was trying to slam the door on that\nBut once he was president of Eighteen twelve he's the one who opened the door to a president go into Congress and saying I think there should be a war and if you hadn't had Madison do that it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make were almost single head what was\nThe situation that the United states faced in Eighteen twelve\nThe United states had ships that were being harassed by the British are a lot of Americans want it to grab Canada so there was a group and Congress dish Canada then okay absolutely so they said\nHow about a war and Madison said well you know maybe there is a a good rationale for having a war and Madison sort of like the idea of being a war president himself exactly the opposite of the way he was in Seventeen eighty seven in Philadelphia\nI'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting and what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the perfect way of putting it\nIn Madison also knew that it would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for re election to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of sounds pretty modern does not\nSo James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in warm making although they're still asking Congress at that point ... let's go ahead a few decades to James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James ... was a liar and a cheese and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war\nWith Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states Eighteen forty six he sat\nAmerican troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans the Mexicans fought back\nAnd poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly\nGave it to I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between us and Mexico right he did\nAnd the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress and say we need a big war with Mexico but wait\nA minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was actually taking their authority away\n... Sen sad that poker is trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why aren't we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that\nLasted in the future okay but still at that time in history Congress was declaring war the president would ask Congress would do it if we go ahead a century to around Nineteen fifty Harry Truman is the president of the United states what happened to Nineteen fifty [noise] I Love ... but\nHe lived a terrible thing in Nineteen fifty North Koreans attacked the south in June of Nineteen fifty and what Truman should have done under the constitution he should have gone to Congress and said\nI had like a war declaration they would have given up to him but Truman was terrified that there'd be a big debate where he might be criticized ... might undermine him in the mid term elections\nOf Nineteen fifty so trauma didn't even bother going to Congress he said I'm doing this as a police action under the United nations I don't need\nA declaration and the result of that was that Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four when he wanted his war in Vietnam said Truman didn't ask Congress I don't have to do it either and we've never had a declaration of war sense not since Nineteen forty two and that is totally in violation of the constitution [noise] what\nAre some of the consequences of this evolution increase really in presidential power when we look at the last I don't know twenty Thirty years\nThe result is a modern president nowadays can start a war almost singlehandedly and most of them are tempted because they know that if you've got political problems and you get the United states into a war that as popular your poll ratings were arrives\nYou write early in this book\nWe're the founders to come back they would probably be astonished and chagrined discovered that in spite of their ardent striving Z the life or death of much of the human race has now come to depend on the character of the single person who happens to be president of the United states\nThe founders knew but almost anyone could become president and they didn't want all of our security to rest on whoever happens to\nGet a job when you wrote that line recently did you have any particular individual in mind\nTrump has often talked about starting wars for political reasons in two thousand eleven he tweeted\nPresident Obama's going to start a war with Iran in order to get reelected president he predicted that President Obama would do that that nobody makes the connection between war and politics at the founders never wanted to see a president make\nThe other thing is that like other presidents President Trump is mark remarked on the facts but often times if you want to be considered a great president it's easier to do that\nYou've been commander in chief during war that has a thought that our founders would never wanted to hear from any president\nOne of the recent episode I Want to ask about presidents Obama and two thousand Thirteen seemed on the verge of launching an attack against Syria because of Syria's use of chemical weapons\nI'm ready to act in the face of this average today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world\nBut we are ready to move forward together as one nation and specifically said I'm not going to do that without the approval of Congress\nIt's seen as a serious mistake and foreign policy has left ... out of Syria was much more freedom would you argue that it was the right choice even though it seems to have been a mistake\nI figured it was always the right choice for president never to get into a war unless he's got Congress in with him on the take off he belatedly saw that that was not going to be possible and that's why he pulled back\nMichael Beschloss says the author of presidents of war the epic story from it you know seven to modern times thanks so much fun it's great to see [noise]\nThey see is Austin's NPR station K.

T. it's\nNine a one\n...\nThere's a lot at stake in this year's midterm elections Donald Trump's legislative agenda ... ability to put conservative judges on the court but the political stakes are particularly high for the party currently out of power and cares national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports\nI asked veteran democratic strategist Paul the Gallup what's at stake for his party in the mid term elections oh everything everything everything to the gallon the old cliche about this election being the most important one of our lifetimes is really true\nThe Democrats are completely shut out even though they've won the popular vote a lesson in presidential elections and even though they mostly when the popular vote for the house\nIf the Democrats lose this fall and losing means failing to take back the house and make significant gains at the state level somebody shut out again without saying legislation judicial appointments or as former Bill Clinton aide lame Kmart points out in the next congressional redistricting that happens after the twenty twenty cents is winning\nBack some state legislatures or at least getting close is critical for the long term future of the Democrats I mean you know we've had several elections now where there are more democratic votes for democratic members of Congress like Democrats can't win because all the Democrats have been gerrymandered into one district\nSo Democrats has to get control of state legislatures and stop that practice\nIs really has almost should life and death\nThe difference between life and death that's Ron Klain another previously mild mannered Democrat with a currently apocalyptic view of the stakes for his party in November former top aide in the Clinton and Obama White house is clean says it's Democrats lose in November of their worst nightmares come true and Trump has a free hand\nThat means he couldn't fire Jeff Sessions and essentially end the mole or investigation and replace him once it was for a journal who's choosing means the Trump could continue to roll back regulatory protections undo the Affordable CARE Act\nBut if the Democrats win one house or both claimed says then Congress returns to being a check and balance on the president and there will be a lot of oversight\nYou'll start to see questions being asked about how taxpayer dollars are being wasted how the government is being used as a piggy big for the Trump family you'll see also looks at what's going on some of these agencies how big corporate interests are turning or environmental laws inside out at the very middle protection agency and the Interior Department\nIn addition to investigating called the Gallup says Democrats do also plan to legislate\nIf the Democrats take the house and they pass things that people want like an increasing the minimum wage like a child care Bill White controlling prescription drug costs like shoring up pre existing conditions and reducing the cost premium ... didn't let the Senate take it up or not and then you've got something to run on\nEven if they can't overcome Senate Republicans or a presidential veto the Gallo says Democrats can set an agenda for the next election and twenty twenty\nBut Republicans who've been through this before say be aware of what you wish for Eric Cantor is the former Republican majority leader who came to power when Republicans took over the house after President Obama's first midterm that was thanks to the Tea Party movement which wanted instant results\nI can tell you if we want contemplating it leaf monthly if not more often and repealing Obamacare\nThan we were not doing all we could even though there was no chance that a bill to repeal Obamacare would pass a Democratic Senate or would be signed into law by President Obama himself\nCanter says Democrats if they went and we'll have to deal with the same danger of super high expectations from their left wing base\nConstituencies are going to expect abolishing eyes they're going to expect a Democratic majority to implement and execute on Medicare for all and at the most extreme they're going to expect the Democrats too\nMajority in the house to uh go ahead and in the program\nIf the Democrats win the house impeachment will quickly become their biggest hot potato they're left wing activist base will demand they moved quickly to impeach the president but the Democrats leadership in Congress is lukewarm at best to that idea\nBut Democrats are willing to wrestle with the political pressures and perils of impeachment because they know it's a problem they'll only have if they win the majority again Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\n\nThree journalists at the largest private newspaper in me and ... have been arrested\nAs came after government official complaint about their reporting on Monday the paper published a story about government spending and no bid contracts by the local government which is headed by a political ally of me and Mars to factor leader on onto chain here's reporter Michael Sullivan\nTo senior editors and the papers chief reporter at eleven media were detained for violating section five oh five of Myanmar's colonial Arab penal code which prohibits publishing information that may cause fear or alarmed to the public or disrupt public tranquility\nIt's hard to see how the newspaper story on public spending by the ongoing government bits either description\nCritics say it's the latest attempt by government officials to muzzle me on Mars independent journalists\nWhat it indicates is that the Myanmar government sees the media as the enemy it she's independent press as a threat to the ability of the national league for democracy to run the government as it wants when it wants without any sort of information provided the public\nPhil Robertson is deputy Asia director for human rights watch\nThis is a situation frankly where people are using national security laws to shut down corruption investigation mean we're really going back\nTo a time when the dictatorships of past military regimes controlled everything that people saw and heard an all time so she should be ashamed at first that she is just standing by while this is happening\nThe arrests game just a few weeks after two Reuters reporters were sentenced to seven years in prison for\nViolating the official secrets act while investigating the massacre of twelve Muslim minority roaming the trial which saw a police captain testified that the two journalists had been set up was widely condemned by the international community but also to cheat defended the verdict at a recent world Economic Forum meeting in Vietnam\nNeither not jaded and the judge has given day because to call it has decided that they had woken deficiencies attack so if we believe in the rule of law they have every right to appeal to the detriment to point out why adjustments room if they consider that to him\nSo cheesy government is becoming increasingly isolated because of the violent crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya by Myanmar's military which both of us and that you end up called ethnic cleansing are you in fact finding team last month recommended that Myanmar's military commander and other top officers be prosecuted on charges of genocide\nMyanmar continues to deny the allegations and sushi continue to ask

California and I'm Rachel Martin in Washington DC we are learning more this morning about what may have happened to the missing\nSaudi journalist democracy Shelby\nHe entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last week that much we now but he has not been seen sense 'cause he wrote for the Washington Post and had been living in the U.S\nThe post is reporting that at one point the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered Saudi agents to lure 'cause she'll give back to the country Saudi officials continue to deny any involvement in the show he's disappearance\nWe're joined now by ... he's the Washington Post correspondent in Istanbul who's been following this story closely thanks so much for being with us cream\nThanks for having me your reporting none of your colleagues shows that the U.S intelligence community knew what at one point the Saudi Arabia was trying to get ... back to Saudi Arabia\nUm why were they trying to get him back and how were they trying to get him back uh\nYeah so as you say the the us is gathered intelligence that showed that the crown prince ordered this operation to lure him from Virginia back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd U.S officials told my colleague that intelligence intercepts captured Saudi officials discussing this um it's pretty significant and it appears\nTo confirm that the Saudi leadership at the highest levels will seeking asylum Jamal a he had written columns in the last year and the Washington Post criticizing some of the monarchies policies\nIncluding the arrest of women's rights advocates there on the Saudis have said that they have nothing to do with his disappearance and you know even that they were friendly with him and they're not worried about the safety of the intelligence\nIntercepts obviously\nUnder a search and um and they and they really add\nTo the growing pressure on the Saudi Government now to explain what happened\nRight so let me ask you so basically you and your colleagues are reporting that what happened in his ... his disappearance had that conflict could in some way to be like a backup plan it clearly they weren't able to get him back to Saudi voluntarily\nSo allegedly they've kidnapped him when he was in Turkey I mean\nCertainly those intelligence intercepts have raised the possibility a you know ... there's been very little hard evidence about what\nInside that conflict there is that there is\nThis theory that that what happened inside\nMay have been part of a a\nPlan to capture that somehow with\nRaul so US Senators have that triggered something called the Magnitsky Act which requires the White House to put sanctions on whomever is responsible for his disappearance even if it's the top leadership in Saudi but how do we find that out who was actually leading the investigation to find out the truth is if the ... the U.S so they working together [noise]\nThe ... you know the the Turks are leading an investigation um they they are a gathering evidence from various locations around assemble and uh they say that they will present their findings\nUm ah when the time is right um but you know all of\nThis has raised questions about whether the U.S had a duty to warn Jim how about the details of the far that they've discovered and it's also you know been embarrassing for the Trump Administration which has cultivated very close ties with the crown prince and held him up as this potentially transformative leader in the middle east\n... of the Washington Post ah from his bureau in as temple thank you so much thanks\nGregory mentioned President Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia and speaking of that the president is vowing to quote get to the bottom of what happened to democracy it would be this is the president speaking yesterday\nThis is a bad situation we can live his\nLet's talk about this more with Ian Bremmer he's a political scientist and also founder of the global political risk consultancy firm that you raise your group but we'll come back to the program sure have to do that so\nThe president saying that ah he's not going to let this happen it's a bad situation but can you just give us the context here what is President Trump is ... and his administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince\nWell as you remember the first trip the truck made outside the United states wasn't to Canada or Mexico traditionally what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel a disclosure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mama been following the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it ... it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage\nRelationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at uh in in another country um to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about North Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier are presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkers soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore\nUm look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies conflict abroad by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is it interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and on the same way that we've seen 'em a sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Austin", "day": "11"}
