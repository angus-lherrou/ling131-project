U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one off than we are online and K. U. T. that or\nSenators are voting after they had a chance to share a single copy of an FBI background investigation just how limited with the bureau background\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in this hour we're running a former federal prosecutor democratic senator\nWas are where you're the winner of the Nobel Peace prize\nWe get a glimpse of a longer Trump She was kind of your story tours headlines\nOn the news is next\nDirect the FBI to follow certainly do not follow certain leads and really the question here is you know what what was the scope of the FBI investigation\nOr the president at one point suggests that the FBI was permitted to do whatever it would like 'em but there's been numerous or you know press reports from various sources suggesting that that was not the case\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before this investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time in scope but but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it was the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean it is indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have been for people inside the agency\nWell that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but uh I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that maybe the result of all of that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so\nThroughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources\nThat certain um individuals are not being interviewed that um that the the FBI investigation was very limited\nThat they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those\nUm some of those ah pieces of information may have appeared to have come from from people within the bureau [noise]\nSo if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine bought before the first Kavanaugh accuser um the FBI did not\nTalk to them if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\n[noise] [noise] well certainly the FBI um I I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were tasked with interviewing 'em and so\nYou know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Mir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI\nOr did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and and frankly that does move the ball forward because for example until this FBI investigation mark judge it not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had he had just written had his attorney write a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward\nUm but it it it is I think I'm too everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was interviewed within the week\nI Wish which could have happened 'cause the FBI is very considerable resources and presumably could have could have done so and certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on Dr Ford who who were not interviewed\nLet me just ask you a judge Kevin wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal or yesterday defending his record I'm also defending a what what he described was his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony what what did you make of of that\nOver those very unusual for um a judicial nominee to write an op ed I Can't recall it ever occurring in my lifetime I'm so that's that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment\nIt it was I think he I I think I was pleased that\nThis has become an issue because I think for each each ... to me it should have been a nonpartisan issue that\nUm both sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing that said he suggested that he was emotional and so on and those were his prepared remarks so I thought that are run our\nFormer federal prosecutor and not to marry ... thanks as always\nThank you\nWe

the war in Iraq or during their war I should say in Iraq and Syria and she escaped and became a really a local ... a spokesperson for\nUh for the victims of the source of these sorts of crimes\nUm the committee says that they selected these two for making crucial contributions for focusing attention on infighting war crimes he's seen as the helper who devoted his life defending victims and she as a witness who speaks bravely about the horrific abuses against\nHer I was just thinking about that what a remarkable thing to do not only to escape to to survive that ordeal but to talk about it afterwards something that's very difficult for anyone to discuss to talk about it publicly an advocate for people\nAbsolutely I mean she she is one of the few many of them are are too afraid to speak a and she was a last year named as a UN ambassador for her efforts are are basically the first goodwill ambassador for the dignity of survivors of human trafficking\nAnd how did Dr ... rise to global prominence well\nHe's not as Dr miracle again for his just absolute skill and his absolute devotion to these women and victims of\nOf gang rape in war in his country and he basically the committee says that he's the four most most unifying symbol both nationally and internationally of the struggle to and sexual violence in war an armed conflict\nWhen you say in war is this dangerous work to be helping the victims of sexual violence in a wartime situation\nYeah absolutely I he has faced a many death threats and uh basically uh there's one in September two thousand twelve or he gave a speech decrying\nThe horrors of maps rape in Congo at the un and then a month later gunman came into his home and tried to kill him his wife and their two daughters his guard was the only person that managed

senators have to view the FBI report the additional background information are looking into the allegations against Kavanaugh what did you see\nWhat's most striking about this report is what's missing\nThere are no interviews with some of the really key witnesses including Dr ... the Ford and judge Kavanaugh themselves as well as other I witnessed\nThere is evidence that should have been pursued lead that should've been followed answers that should have been thought and it has all the appearance of a white water\nHad let let me just ask about that senator because although it is true that there is not a very large number of witnesses who ride the uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nInterview conducted by the FBI leads to additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist with NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly described as to who they could interview and how long they had\nAnd as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate record\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nThat's incorrect so is the contention that there is no end of misconduct there is it's a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in this interview although it's not in court in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez\nAnd the specific eye witness than other leads that should have been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way it Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their\nIntentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nLet me just hundreds and let me just to untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there's some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there's solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach by here too important points first of all this report should be made public so you and I\nCan engage in a real conversation and so that the contention

thirds of the fifty million people in service sector frontline jobs today have literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous e gaps they're already in the workforce\nSo what we're trying to do is make it the norm not to say at Wal Mart but across employers in general that people can learn on the job\nSo we've come at it a couple of different ways one is through our own training programs and then what we've also done is a program that allows people to get access to four year degrees a dollar a day on their own time\nWas ... when I have to ask you why is this Wal Mart's problem\nIt's in the interest in any business to address the challenges and opportunities that\nThey have to do with the systems they rely on in our case our people are critical that's how we serve

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC and I'm David Greene in Culver City California later today we're going to find out whether the Senate is\nMoving ahead to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court now however that vote goes it is certainly not going to be the end of the story exactly a year ago today Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault\nIn an investigation into New York times the me too movement is radically changing discourse around women and sexual harassment but Kavanaugh nomination has led to another movement and hash tag the hash tag believe survivors movement now our next guest has some complicated feelings about that\nEmily Yoffe is a contributing editor at the Atlantic and she wrote a piece titled the problem with ... take belief survivors and she joins us this morning thanks for taking the time\nBut to be here so why did you decide to write this piece\nI Am a big supporter of me to of women especially what we're seeing long silence women come forward and tell their stories I think it's all to the good although it's causing a lot of French in conversation and people who come forward\nAbsolutely need support from loved one's family friends us therapeutic community if they seek that out and they should be believed within that community my concern is that\nThis ... cannot apply when a specific man is accused and some kind of a Judy ... investigation or life altering effects happen\nWe simply can't believe one party over another uh just on the basis of someone coming forward that is not how justice works\n[noise] so what what are you asking for practically I mean how do you both tell women and tell survivors of sexual assault that they will be believed that come forward but then also add but we're not sure that this man did this you've got to show the evidence like how do you\nHow do you handle that\nWell as I say that I that we're hearing a lot of testimony from women saying here is something that happened to me\nAnd they're leaving in at that and and there have been interesting stories from women saying I'm not going to name this person this happened a long time ago\nI thought about it it's not going to do any good to disrupt his life or mine okay so that's one set of uh issues and that is a fairly self contained but as we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen someone is accused\nWe need some way to weigh the two sides because\nSometimes we have men we've seen in the me too movement saying a as Lucy Kate yeah what these women said is right I did it a oftentimes we don't ah and\nI think we can draw some concerning lessons from campus where over the past six years or so\nUh there's been kind of a revolution in title nine this is the federal law that ah govern that that means no a sex discrimination on campus and under this has been\nA a\nAn effort to in an effort to eliminate sexual assaults on campus and what could be more worthy [noise] a lot of miss justices have happened and systems have been put in place that are fundamentally unfair\nMiss justices you're you're saying most justices I mean the the accused of have not been treated fairly and I know this was something you have written a lot about ah when this happened on college campuses what what what happens to be accused what have you seen happen on college campuses uses an unjust\nIf you come forward with a report of a sexual misconduct against you whoever does that is entitled to support advocacy help and the people charged with doing that should believe you and help you\nBut that can't to bleed over into the investigation and advocacy process and unfortunately that happened that same point of view the accuser is telling the truth\nAnd we don't believe the accused became kind of a fundamental underpinning for a lot of these uh adjudication\nI'm young men who say they were ... and unfairly treated had been bringing lawsuits by the hundreds and they've been increasingly a meeting with success in the courts with the court saying wait a minute this is America you can have systems\nAre based on a a pre determined assumption I at the end of the\nDay I mean that that the central question really seems to be is there a way to protect the accused while still encouraging women to be able to speak up about what could be painful and humiliating experiences I mean how do you\nProtect the accused without sending a message to survivors that it's basically you've got to prove it\nThat's the question isn't it [laughter]\nI don't have the final answer\nIn some ways we can look at this Kavanaugh wrenching Kavanaugh experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nReluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process\nAnd there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end of the day\nUm they didn't chip away at her and her credibility remained intact in it I I thought it was really helpful to hear the account of of someone who said she has been through this\nTwenty percent chance of showers and thunderstorms today otherwise partly sunny with a high near eighty eight but keep in mind as you head out the doors and patchy fog

and I'm David Greene today we're marking an anniversary twenty five years ago this week was the last time the federal gas tax went up today\nThat taxes still what it was in Nineteen Ninety three Eighteen point four cents per gallon and yet the cost of building and maintaining roads and bridges are going up here's more from NPR's David Schaper\nThe first week of October Nineteen Ninety three the top TV shows were home improvement Seinfeld and the first Roseanne the top song was Mariah Carey dream lover you could still buy a Sony Walkman for twenty nine Ninety five gas was just one dollar and eleven cents a gallon\nAnd one of the top movies that year started film are free\nTo reliving the same day over and over\nGroundhog Day or is about bill Murray's character getting caught in a time loop and he spends decades reliving the same Groundhog Day those of us that have followed ... can't help but feel some of the same repetition\nCarl Davis is with the nonpartisan Institute on taxation and economic policy and he says that's because the federal gas tax is still the same Eighteen point four cents a gallon that it was when Groundhog Day was playing in theaters twenty five years ago\nThe whole reason this tax exists is to keep our roads paved and to keep our bridges from falling down and to do that effectively that needs to collect a sustainable amount of revenue over time and it can't do that if it's just not updated for decades of time with\nRising construction and labor costs than less gas being used in more fuel efficient cars the purchasing power of the gas taxes now sixty four percent less than it was it Nineteen Ninety three\nIllinois transportation secretary Randy blanket horn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways bridges in transit systems\nWere losing revenue another day just because of inflation without new federal money the cap of what we can do is there we are right now\nSimply maintaining what we have\nSo Kevin ... the national conference of state legislatures says while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax states are taking action themselves\nIn the last five years we've seen many states more than half of them actually enact legislation to increase funding for transportation\nSince two thousand ten thirty three states have raised their own motor fuel taxes Missouri joined them next month the voters approve of ten cents a gallon gas tax hike at Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation subject\nAnd many states are also now indexing the gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise some states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage based user fees that will tax electric cars that also we're down roads but don't use gas\nStaying with Groundhog Day theme Congress does hold hearings from time to time of ways the hike federal funding for transportation but there is almost never vote ears Nevada congresswoman Dena Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago\nWere having the same conversation the same rhetoric named it makes an F a structure we need to look at the answer is just a matter of paying for it but there's no substantive plan\nSo when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding and the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say it's deja vu\nAll over again David Schaper NPR News Chicago\nMORNING EDITION on K U T Ninety point five I'm Jennifer state and\nYou've heard that saying truth is stranger than fiction right it's a quote from Mark Twain and the full

U. T. N. K. U. T. H. deem line on than we are online at K. U. T. ...\nSenators are voting after they had a chance to share a single copy of an FBI background investigation just how limited was the bureau's background check on the\nGround and I'm Steve Inskeep in this hour we question a former federal prosecutor and democratic Senator Richard\nAlso this hour we learned the names of the recipients of the Nobel Peace prize and get a glimpse of a lot of Trump visits Kenya and still recording headline\nAnd the news is next\nOr the president at one point suggests that the FBI was permitted to do whatever it would like 'em but there's been numerous for press reports from various sources suggesting that that was not the case\nI mean James Comey the former FBI Director did this op ed days before the investigation suggesting like this was a moment I mean the FBI was with limited in terms of time in scope but but he said the FBI\nCan do this suggesting it with the independent agency that that would rise up in this moment I mean if indeed the White House was really dictating a lot of this how uncomfortable might that have been for people inside the agency\nWell that certainly could have been ... uncomfortable I think age is you know may have been telling themselves well this is you know we're only we're doing\nOur job in the sense that this is a background check and we're following whatever leads we're being told to follow 'em but uh I you know there are certainly may have been some discomfort and I think that maybe the result of a ... that may have resulted in the leaks that we saw so\nThroughout the course of the investigation it became apparent from various news sources that certain um individuals are not being interviewed that um that the the FBI investigation was very limited that they had been instructed not to follow certain leads and so on at least some of those\nUm some of those ah pieces of information may have appeared to have come from from people within the bureau\n[noise] so if for example um you know there were witnesses who were put forward by Christine bought before the first Kavanaugh accuser um the FBI did not talk to\nThem if that is true and if as you say the White House was sort of dictating how this happened um what was credible about this report\nOr certainly the FBI I'm a I have no doubt that the FBI did their job and interviewing the individuals that they were\nTasked with interviewing 'em and so well you know we have an idea of some of the people that at the very least who were interviewed by the FBI for example Mr Mir as a mark judge and so on and I have no doubt that the FBI\nOr did their best to interview those people within the best of their ability and and frankly that does move the ball forward because for example until this FBI investigation mark judge should not been interviewed\nBy a by anyone he had he had just written had his attorney right a short statement to the committee so this this does move the ball forward um but it it it is I think I'm too everyone's detriment that it it doesn't resolve all the questions that we have that everyone was and interviewed within the week\nUh which which could have happened 'cause the FBI is very considerable resources and and presumably could have could have done so it certainly could have interviewed judge Kavanaugh on Dr Ford who who were not interviewed\nLet me just ask you I'm just Kevin wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal or yesterday defending his record I'm also defending a what what he described was his in his own words I mean very emotional testimony what what did you make of of that\nOver those very unusual for um a judicial nominee to write an op ed or I Can't recall it ever occurring in my lifetime I'm so that's that's the first thing it's certainly quite a moment\nA it was I think he I I think I was pleased that\nThis has become an issue because I think for each each ... to me it should have been a nonpartisan issue that\nUm both sides should have felt that it was inappropriate for a judge to make the sort of partition comments that he did during the hearing that said he suggested that he was emotional and so on and those were his prepared remarks so I thought that run our\nFormer federal prosecutor and not to ... thanks as always thank you\nHey we now know the recipients of the Nobel Peace prize the announcement came this morning from the Nobel Institute in Oslo their names

senator because although it is true that there's not a very large number of witnesses who arrived uh who are identified and interviewed\nMark judge was interviewed we're told and that is the individual that Dr bluffing Ford said was in the room at the time of this sexual assault they hadn't been interviewed before just made a a general statement denying any knowledge now he's been interviewed by the professionals did they find anything\nWell I Can't go into what was found and what's in the report but let me just speak generally\nEvery interview conducted by the FBI leads\nTo additional witnesses and information that has to be pursued it is a great journalist NPR pursue leave after they\nHear them in interviews so do the FBI is what happened here was that if I Would certainly ascribe as to who they could interview and how long they add and as a result we have a very incomplete and inadequate record\nReading granting that is it a correct statement made by Republicans when they say they're still is no corroboration of the allegations against the Supreme Court nominee capital\nSo is the contention that there is no end of misconduct there is a matter of public record powerful\nTestimony in the interview although it's not in court in the interview from\nDeborah Ramirez\nAnd the specific I wouldn't than other lead that should've been pursued about or are nowhere here including by the way Connecticut constituent who had information that judge Kavanaugh reaching out to some of those witnesses in an apparent effort\nTo shape their intentions to a New Yorker interview and that will\nAllow luggage contradiction and let me just untangle that and the minute that we have left here or there have been some allegations some suggestions that there may have been contact between Brett Kavanaugh people close to him\nAnd Deborah Ramirez and people close to her before that story was revealed a it's our understanding that Republicans have looked at that evidence and not found anything there there is some text messages that are subject to interpretation or you alleging there is solid evidence that Kavanaugh himself was involved in some kind of cover up\nThere's certainly evidence of that outreach by here too important\nWell first of all this report should be made so you and I\nCan't engage in a real conversation and so that the contention them making can order by twenty two parts of the report second this issue of temperament has now come to the fore especially after John Paul Stevens yesterday the former Supreme Court\nSaid that his former committee last Thursday was disqualified self getting arrogant\nAcrimony frightening demeanor that he brought to the court in many ways on math\nThe judge and showed us the real man\nWatches up a

their moms to poachers but they are a door oval found it comes to lead toward their morning snack the first lady smiles broadly watching the elephant gulp massive bottles milk [noise]\nAlong at Trump makes no public statement her main point to her office has said is to highlight the work of us said on the continent but the words and policies of her husband have also cast a shadow\nPresident Trump has reportedly disparaged African countries and his administration has loosen restrictions on importing trophies from big game hunting and they've also re instituted a policy that bans aid from any organization and even talk about abortion\nJustices are supposed to be above the political break so how will despite the fact that the Supreme Court and that story is afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nDon't miss all things considered starting this afternoon at four o'clock\nIn the U.S Senate is expected to hold a cloture vote this morning to close debate on the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court NPR will offer live special coverage of the vote with one hour special recap and that starts this morning here on K. U. T. at eight thirty and\nThink about this or braids memory is an amazing thing 'cause it reads aren't normally normally go with your heart you don't have any idea why what are\nWomen what was that if you do you hear that music was no there is no no there's no there's no I can I can I can hear right now I'm ... I'm ... I'm Rebecca\nMakin right and this is two guys on your head today gap I think\nA lot of what we\nBelieve in a about the world is is not information that we get from our own sense is\nCertainly we we get a lot of information from our senses but a lot of what we believe comes from other people and and as a result of that we have to find ways to decide what information should we believe that we're getting from the people around us\nAnd one of the things that might influence whether we choose to believe something is if either a person in authority is saying something frequently or if lots of people are saying something then\nThat feels like something that must have some truth to it ... regardless of what the actual facts on the ground or\nYeah and and I we we forget how susceptible we are to being influenced in our thinking by things that we don't think our influence in our thinking I mean there's are saying we we trust our perceptual systems to tell us what's going on in the world\nAnd yet because as artists saying often were social species and so we interact with other people whose opinions influenced our own opinions\nThe same thing actually holds true not just for things that we would call opinions but the things that we would call back mhm yeah and that's really where this is crucial so the example that Bob was giving is is an important one because\nThere's there's a fact of the matter here I mean you you could find lots of ways to independently verify which line is longer\nAnd your your visual system actually generally speaking does a pretty good job of figuring out which line is longer and yet despite what you're seeing you will actually begin to state and and potentially even believe\nThat that your visual system is is giving you the wrong information just because of the social\nConsensus that formed on the other side that's actually a fairly common aspect of human psychology because we have to determine what to believe from the people around us but the concept of gas lighting is is essentially a deliberate use\nOf a strategy that takes into account the fact that uh the social environment has a big influence on what people believe\nBut a point that are making this really important to emphasize and this is how verbal rehearsal changes belief I mean not just what you say out loud changes the way other people think what you believe\nBut saying things yourself river Herschel really changes what you come to believe is true and when you're in an environment where are the people around you the public media all kinds of sources of information or professing a certain a view of the world\nAnd now that's in your memory and we every time you call it is a mind that's another reversal of calling to mind that actually becomes more and more true but often you know ... ... when we're trying to um make our own decisions about something whatever happens to be\nWe we we tend to decide who among all the sources of information either people or organizations were media streams or whatever who who should I be trusting in the most\nThat if there are things that differ\nAnd things that are that are in in in disagreement who I'm going to put more credibility ... they don't want to say too about you know we're talking about this can actually be a good thing is it almost all aspects of human functioning\nCan be co opted priests of ill intense but actually the same mechanisms are being used in those things about organizations who are trying to say something repeatedly so it actually becomes the fact of the matter is our earlier now\nNot only can can these mechanisms ... co opted for nefarious purposes society but but the same mechanisms can also play a role in just one on one interactions in which\nYou you may actually change the way that you interpret\nSomething that's happened in your life on the basis of things that\nAnother significant person in your lives and if that individual has an ulterior motive to get you to believe something that is more favorable for them and less favorable for you even in very significant circumstances\nThis can actually then cause you to question your entire view of\nOf reality inside of of that interpersonal relations and this is particularly dangerous in situations in which something that's happened to someone a in a relationship is is something that they might actually be a afraid of or shame to or not actually want to\nTalk to lots of people about because in those situations are the conversations that you end up having are often had with a single individual yeah\nAnd and hey\nWhen when you when you may have something that's happened to you that that fuels\nShameful then you'd actually like to believe that it didn't happen right so there's some motivated reasoning to want to to go along with someone who said owner or you have a ... you've completely misunderstood the situation\nBut on top of that you can't engage in any of the other behaviors you would normally engage in to try to check your interpretation of a situation\nSo often if you're confused about something you consult another authority or another individual\nSo you know if you can't decide which actor was in a particular movie which is there's no shame in that then you talk about it for a while and no matter how confident everybody is then you go to IMDB and you'll look it up yeah\nBut when a and and and similarly you know if if you're confused about about some something that somebody else going on in the world or even some event in your life\nYou can you you might just reach out to a bunch of friends and say well so you know here's here's what happened what do you think ... and and in those circumstances your friends will give you a different opinion or their own opinion which may or may not accord with what you heard from someone else and that gives you perspective\nBut if you're unwilling or unable um or or or ashamed to talk about something with anyone else now the single individual you may be talking to has a profound influence over the set of beliefs that you end up\nNext week we'll talk about scooter culture with Dr

loves well mine's Titanic\nWhenever she's with her friends about real when\nThe news is next\nA carrot ... let me ask about the way that a judge Kavanaugh has defended himself because that was as you know very well has become a subject to some criticism he was so passionate and so angry and his public testimony\nA John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice said at an event in Florida that he no longer beliefs Kevin should be confirmed to the Supreme Court because of the way that he spoke in public was listen to some of that\nIs a thing to the New Jersey and he should have been for a when he was ... that I think that the his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nAnd let me ask about that should we have a Supreme Court justice who declared in sworn testimony with no evidence to back it up that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons and the Democrats should be punished for this\nWhile they're going to talk about allegations of no evidence to back that we can certainly talk about the allegations that have been made against such cabinet\nWell and I know what about ism here he's the guy who's about to go on to the Supreme Court should we have a Supreme Court justice who's made those partisan statements\nI think that Kavanaugh [laughter] a very rightfully so was\nUpset at ... cute as being a gang rape is that you have to remember the first set of hearing that was that was the job interview this second hearing that was judge Kavanaugh defending us every patient defending his\nDefending his family I think any human being who had been falsely accused of a range of things including ... have the right to be upset with the right to be angry and that's what we saw\nUm now he has penned up at Penn as they say you know he wrote an op ed in the wall Street Journal he's at a didn't quite apologize but did say that he got angry and he said quote I said a few things I should not have said not specify what they were what did he say that he shouldn't have said\nWell I think if you're number at the hearing last week can spend our club which are got to a little bit on a a little discussion a little heated discussion about drinking and I know judge Kaplan I regret it uh the way he\nInteracted with a center club which are which is why he apologized you are on the spot but look\nThis is a man who has been accused by by people who do not have any evidence to back up their accusation he was put before the American people to defend himself against really egregious charges and make complete sense that he was upset considering\nA than many many women who have come out in\nHis defense saying what an incredible person he is not just that the judge but his treatment of women\nI'm really wondering if we're all very quickly on two things you said no evidence we have to know if there was sworn testimony by a person who says she's the victims so we can't truthfully say no\nOperating you Robert and Robert ... per hour you know the thing are you ... you said he takes back his statements to him in Columbus are meaning he doesn't take back the Clinton conspiracy theory part\nWell he certainly apologize than our club which I don't want to I don't want to get the ins and outs of a judge Kavanaugh's thoughts on on his testimony but he's certainly apologized their public and again the way it gets kind of an odd and treated during the process and it just trade\nGary ... is a White House spokesperson thanks for joining us this morning really appreciate it thanks right now and NPR's Tim Mak is covering the story and has been listening along with this what did you hear there too\nWell they said they believe they have the votes but as of now that information is not public we're going into a key procedural vote in just a few hours that's expected just a few hours uh and we don't know where the critical votes of Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Jeff Flake of Arizona\nJoe Manchin of West Virginia we don't know where they are\nSo there's four votes that are unknown and Republicans need to get I guess we should be clear about this do to get two fifty right\nNow just right and if you get to fifty the vice president can cast that deciding vote to make it a to basically confirmed\nBrett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and then if they cut off debate today what happens then\nWell then there would be unexpected final vote later this weekend uh now that the procedural vote is so critical because if he gets the votes for that he's likely to get the votes on the final\nMom you're measuring number of votes that

though today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital we as I walked into the Capitol today they're barricades at

Kavanaugh not only is willing to disregard president but his opinions fail to appreciate the challenging realities women face when making these most difficult decisions\nWhen I asked him about whether

special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some of the Senate speeches today is where your way to vote on the ending of debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court\nNPR's Kelsey Snell is at the Capitol and listening along with us and kills you just want to know something is Dianne Feinstein the\nSenior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee begins her speech your Chuck Grassley of Iowa primarily focused on the lack of evidence against Brett Kavanaugh the accusations that have delayed this nomination and made allegations of democratic conspiracies a left wing groups a shaming us all his Grassley put a\nFeinstein has returned to more traditional ground of arguing about Kavanaugh's judicial record and her disagreements with ... with him and and her suspicions that he's been placed on the court to overturn roe versus Wade or something like\nYeah I think that's partially because Democrats have more or less identified a three part strategy of al ...\nThey want to remind all of their voters that even if they do not win on that says if Kavanaugh is confirmed that they fought on both his credentials so who are the his position particularly on role and on on gun control those are two major issues that Democrats have been talking about\nThey also want to make the argument about that the what we have heard the past several weeks but the issue about his behavior in high school and college and the allegations of sexual misconduct and the third thing is that they want to focus on the unfairness of this process and the fact that he they believe that he revealed himself to be a partisan during\nThe last hearings so they are going to you're going to hear them throughout the rest of today and now on those three ideas because what they want to do is they want to remind voters that and in this midterm election coming up is their chance to make a choice about who makes these decisions who has the majority and who should be in ... in control of the house and Senate\nScott Detrow we've really seen that that temperament that partisanship argument pickup in the weeks since the hearing ... when Kavanaugh was so confrontational with Democratic senators and that's one reason why\nHe had a remarkable op ed in the wall Street Journal last night saying I may have been too emotional during that time for during the confirmation hearing last week arguing he would be an impartial judge on the bench\nA he said that we couldn't quite say what was that he would have taken back I said some things I shouldn't have said didn't specify let's return to the Senate floor where Dianne Feinstein is still speaking here on here a little bit more of her speech\nHaitian on guns because of widespread ownership in this country I'm also concerned about his views on presidential power specifically he has said that sitting president cannot be indicted\nCannot be prosecuted should not be investigated and should have\nThe authority to fire a special counsel at wealth in other words the president of the United states is above an outside the law\nThese views raised serious concerns that should concern us hall especially at a time when the president continually threatens to fire the leadership of the department of justice for failing to be loyal and raining in the mall or investigation\nThese views alone or not sufficient for me to vote against judge Kavanaugh but what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks\nHas raised serious new concerns\nConcerns I Believe shouldn't worry is all judges are expected to be quote even handed unbiased impartial and courteous\nAnd quote however at the hearing last week we saw a man filled with anger and aggression\nJudge Kavanaugh raised his voice he interrupted senators he accused of damn Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote he even went so far\nAs to say that Dr forwards\nAllegations were nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit filled with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote\nQuote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and ...\nHow could he this behavior revealed hostility and belligerent that is on becoming a someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking that more than two thousand four hundred law professors\nFrom around the country have expressed their opposition they wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and care\nThe allegations that were raised judge Kavanaugh responded in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupted and at times was just courteous to\nFeinstein of California making her arguments here before the and vote to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh talking about the judge's temperament during his testimony last week\nNina Totenberg what are you learning about\nWhat we saw the Justice John Paul Stevens the retired from the Supreme Court last night he was raised Kevin on the path said he say he changed his mind after he saw this performance\nI've talked to some of Kevin as colleagues on the bench on both Republican appointees in democratic twenties and they were really shocked by what they call the dropping of a veil they never knew was there where\nHe talked about a conspiracy or to get revenge for the Clintons be as he was part of the Ken Starr investigation no evidence for that but that was his view and extended under oath\nYeah and and they never seen it and were shocked\nOkay Nina Totenberg is going to remain with us as we continue our coverage here today and let's just review very briefly where we are and then in a moment we're going to take a break and continue hearing the speeches here\nSee continue hearing the speeches today Charles Grassley of Iowa lead off today alleging that left wing groups have quote shame does all with their effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh he said that Senate investigators had been tracking down virtually all leads and that there was nothing at an FBI report we didn't already know\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh and that it's time to confirm this man Dianne

final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nShould be beyond the reach of subpoenas criminal investigations or civil investigations this moment in American history demands deep skepticism about judge Kavanaugh's views on executive power\nNominated as he was by an executive who just stains the constraints of his office\nAnd who is if this very moment\nThe apparent subject of investigations his Supreme Court nominee believes should be invalid I met with judge Kavanaugh for almost two hours I asked him about all of those issues his answers were constantly a vase if\nAn orderly unsatisfactory was deja vu\nAll over again in the first round of hearings when judge Kavanaugh deliberately avoided talking about his views on roe healthcare presidential accountability and more there was no legal reason rule or logic\nThat prevented him\nFrom being clear and saying what he thought he was a basis because he knows\nThat his views are deeply at odds\nWith the progress America has made over the last century of jurisprudence\nWith what most Americans believe his performance was not only unfair and frustrating to the Senate\nIt was unfair to the American people when the nominee refuses to disclose their views\nChances are you have a nominee whose views are far outside the mainstream of America\nWhether they be far right\nMy colleagues on the other side of the child\nMay not have as grave concern about these views as we do but let no American be surprised\nIf judge Kavanaugh becomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people while stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House judge Kavanaugh's nomination ultimately\nDoes not only income there's questions about ideology or credentials\nBut questions of character here again judge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expect and deserve and the Supreme Court justice\nHe has repeatedly misled the Senate about his involvement in some of the most serious controversies of the Bush administration including warrantless wiretapping of American citizens or policy against\nTorture the theft of electronic records from Democratic senators\nAnd his involvement in the nomination a very controversial judges\nFaced with credible allegations of various types of misconduct\nJudge Kavanaugh's credibility was again tested and he continued to assemble and even ... about easily refuted facts\nBeyond the issue of credibility judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate the bitter as partisan testimony I have ever heard coming from a candidate seeking the Senate's approval whether they be for the bench or the executive branch\nNow there are many who thinks that what happened\nWhen judge Kavanaugh was Seventeen years old should not be this positive\nEven if you believe that\nHis actions at age fifty three in terms of demeanor partisanship and above all credibility should be dispositive judges at every level of the federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and morals character judges at every level\nShould be judicious incredible and independent but especially especially on the Supreme Court I Do not see how it's possible for my colleagues to say was perfect confidence that judge Kavanaugh has the temperament independence\nAnd credibility to serve on the United States Supreme court\nSo I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why judge Kavanaugh there is no dictate that you have to march blindly forward with a nominee when there are there is available to you\nThere are many judges who I Am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the court\nI remind my colleagues the seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill was held by a justice who assumed the bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate and the second nominee withdrew his nomination\nBy the Republican majority has press forward blindly on judge Kavanaugh\nEven when brave women came forward to speak truth to power\nOr what cause for the sake of winning that's not reason enough my colleagues on the other side\nIf you have doubts about judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nAbout his ability to tell the truth about his ability to be impartial and nonpartisan\nNo matter what you think of his jurors cruise\nOr what he may or may not have done in high school and college\nYou should not vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court so my friends Democrat and Republican for all the controversy all the heavy hand in the process\nAll the hyperbole and vilification on both sides there's always hope\nThat the Senate and save itself\nWe can salvage some decency here at the end\nIf judge Kavanaugh has rejected President Trump will select another nominee likely right of center probably not to my liking but without the cloud\nHangs over this nominee and we can proceed to consider that nominee and much less better much better less parties in way a bipartisan majority of senators\nConsidering fully the weight of judge Kavanaugh is testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament\nConsidering fully heartbreaking testimony Dr Christine Blasey Ford in both to reject judge Kavanaugh's nomination and asked the president\nTo send the Senate another name\nFor the sake of the Senate of the Supreme\nCourt ended up America I Hope I pray\nMy colleagues will do so [noise]\nThat's Charles Schumer the Senate minority leader and we're waiting on Mitch McConnell the majority leader next Charles Schumer\nMaking the point argument arguing the Democrats have not delayed this nomination divisions among Republicans have done so those listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr actual rock mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice cabin up by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there and now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination every one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes you ever cash\nIn the Senate now the stakes are always hot for a Supreme Court nomination but college the extraordinary events original which have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge shore highest court\nNot any more out after all this United States Senate will also\nBe making a shape whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent\nUntil proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob and ... are valid tactics for shaping the Senate\nThe mob can attack and the Senate cage\nAll set up and say that serious\nThoughtful fact based deliberation well still define this body\n\nAnd restless leg breathless lay the media sees on them the more outlandish the batter Americans who are informed the judge Kavanaugh mastermind violent drug gangs as a young teenager until that accuser walked her story that\n\nWe were informed that judge Kavanaugh beat someone up on a boat in Rhode Island harbor until that accuser total every candidate\nWe are now there are tall tale of physical assault until that account was thoroughly debunked by sitting federal drug Oh yes we were informed that juvenile jokes in his hospital your boat we're actually\nSinister secret references oh the Keystone Cops were on the case Keystone Cops were all in the case madam president\nAnd Senate Democrats cheered them all maybe in parts of this uncorroborated unbelievable mudslide mudslide and to the Senate record\n\nThey sided them and unofficial letter demanding a judge Kavanaugh's nomination be withdrawn\nWhere are they true well of course that was quite beside the point quite beside the point so long as they were convenient\nEffort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mob and the media\nIt went out over the actual evidence make sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here\nThe Senate will have a ... or might impression we're almost at the end of the runway\nAcross rounds of anger and fear and party and she'll have blown strong\nThese past weeks\nThey've harmed a good man and his family they've tarnished the dignity of this institution\nBut all of that going to end it at the time has come to vote\nFor senator stands on the threshold of a golden opportunity\nWe have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well qualified and well respected jurors to oppose that demands such actually we have the opportunity to put judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court or has the same goes service will make us in our nation proud\nFor years to call but we have the opportunity to do even more\nToday we can send a message to the American people that's some core principles remain unfettered by the partners and\nPassions of this moment facts matter fairness matter the presumption of innocence is ... percent of\nThe Senate has turned its back on these things from the format um president but never for law and never without deep regret this has to tuition does outlook back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy or on any of the other times on the politics of personal destruction poison\nIs judgment no no the Senate looks back on those things was shy and when the conviction that we can I go down that road again we know the Senate does better than this when all of the nation deserve better than this\nBack and farming judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court this brilliant jurist will be charged with upholding the rule of law and honoring American Justice whereabouts hold ourselves to that very same standard we must have a golden opportunity before us today from a Supreme Court justice who will make us proud\nAnd three of our um our own commitment to justice that every single American\nDeserves [noise]\nAs a room that's Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader the Republican leader wearing a red tie with spectacles reading from his speech\nJust now calling hit the vote there were about to hear about today one of the most consequential votes you've ever had that is what he described was listening to the uh the action on the floor now\nIt'd be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states sent by Seventeen senators\nAnonymous consent amount of ... is there an objection without any action\nBy unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense that the Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close\nThe ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the Rome history Alexander\nOkay recalling the role this is not formally when the votes will be registered that will take a little while uh but we will learn over the next number of minutes how this vote has turned out\nWe should mention the speeches we've just heard are effectively speeches in one sense for an audience of four because they're only about four lawmakers maybe another that we don't quite know about\nWho are in any way undecided here or Murkowski of Alaska flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Manchin of West Virginia NPR's Scott Detrow has been following their progress there's some news about Susan Collins\nYeah we've been saying all morning that this is a key test vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination but it is not necessarily the final tally Susan Collins confirmed that saying she is going to vote yes this morning on Kavanaugh but that she will announce her final decision on this weekend's final vote later today\nPeople just joining us may ask wait a minute what final decision if she's voting yes isn't that a yes\nThat is usually the case but there are lots of moments where where senators will vote to advance the nomination to a final vote and then change their mind that the last moment most high profile example of that John McCain last year ...\nBecause we just heard the question on the floor is is it the sense of the Senate that were done with debate in effect to paraphrase what the resolution is that they're voting on you can vote to end debate and still vote against the nominee if you should want to do that there is one ah let's give a listen actually to some of what Susan Collins has been saying today she spoke briefly to reporters off the Senate floor\nI Will be voting yes on the head them ... from a ... vote and the ... sign of how to vote later today on pay\nAnd uh you hear everyone trying to get one more question there Susan Collins leaving us in suspense for a few more hours another person on that list of for Joe Manchin the only Democrat from West Virginia a Scott has he been paying attention to those speeches this morning\nHe's been paying very close attention we know that Joe mansion spent more than an hour and that secure room in the Senate today we reading that report he went to the Senate floor not necessarily giving away his hands on how will vote but we are seeing that just now one of those undecided senators Jeff Flake did appear to vote I on cloture\nAgain that may not necessarily be his final vote but we know that flake was initially inclined to to support judge Kavanaugh before he changed his mind last ...\nMansions either way mentioned by the way I always went to the hearings and sat there for hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today then looking again that that FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break the tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or mansion votes for cloture then yes this advances too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this bill may drag out that this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happen to live the United states give a listen to some of\nThat this bring that up and give a listen Moran\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if she's not there yet most will vote if their names are called them this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell", "show_name": "Morning Edition
