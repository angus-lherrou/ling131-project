getting better that's just the fact of life but I think is his ultimate goal is to bring everything here so that way or not happening day shipped overseas I get it and understand\nRemember we've been fighting fighting and fighting and it's like he doesn't care for sure I wouldn't vote for him again\nI just like your style I was just like to weigh those things is ... ... not going to ... to anything and there's some way you know a job either don't like living on the go looking bird modern change\nAnd this is a big part of Trump's appeal we heard people talk about how when they're rooting for the president there really rooting for themselves\nHim being just as human as us the fact that he he failed how many times before he finally succeeded no and I guess one of those tries finally worked out for him and he worked his way up\nThat is the voice of Alex Collins he's twenty four years old and he works the overnight shift at the male factory he and his fiance page Spencer\nThey're living a life you just know so many Americans really they're almost never to get\nOn a Tuesday night recently they were huddled on the couch together watching TV this is the only our of the day when

foster home I ended up in one of my foster brothers actually stopped me one\nAnd he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked with me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some doubts\n[noise] I kind of question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet things started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations yes\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything get better make prices go down you know wanted to go up quality go up and we're not really seeing the results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of them\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad I feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole than it did for anything I mean two hundred people lost their jobs\nThat's a big blow to a small town like this you\nSound like you're open minded like you're

thousands of people\nIn the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country the president\nWas apparently referring to a bridge more than one thousand miles away from the United states with that said there is a group of several thousand migrants with varying descriptions of its size and purpose to check the latest facts we called journalist David ... who was recently with that group and we asked first\nIt is getting near the U.S\n[noise] no not at all it's still a\nProbably close to a thousand miles away from the closest us port of entry and also many in in the caravan are saying that their destination is cheap one of which obviously across from San Diego\nAnd that's a quite a bit a more distant or with any luck they would make it to Mexico City probably around uh the first ... the end of the first week of November and that still quite a ways to go\nI must check the size of this because um yesterday we heard on NPR News from the Mexican ambassador to the United states\nWho said that Mexican authorities are trying to keep tabs on this group and better to a decline in size considerably and he thought it was about thirty five hundred people do you have any way to to to estimate that yourself ... ...\nNobody knows for sure the obviously the official number a that was given at the time or the last week was thirty six hundred with a and just yesterday the interior minister said about Eighteen hundred Eighteen hundred Ninety five people\nHad applied for asylum another five hundred asked to go home of voluntarily mayors along the route had put the number it closer to six thousand a that was just based because on the number of people that they were serving a because they're obviously providing a lot of food and uh obviously\nAssistant for the migrants so nobody knows for sure but it would probably be higher than\nUh okay so it may be higher than thirty five hundred of according to the best information that you have I guess the next question was how many of them are determined to reach the United states as opposed to accepting this Mexican offer of asylum or taking some other course\nWell the ... the migrants themselves how to they tend to have a nightly assembly were they when they arrive in a in a in a village what they'll do is they'll\nThey'll set up camp and they'll be in the town square and they will have an assembly when which they will vote on proposals usually that meaning when they will leave the next morning what route they will take\nAnd the proposal was read to them and they voted to not except that I spoke with migrants who just simply said their goal is to reach the United states so that was so both of them will do their best to get to the United states\nOkay so some of them some of them are coming to the border could be here could be on the other states eventually\nEventually yes I mean there's no nobody's really sure how how quickly they'll get they'll get that they're probably move their moving about forty miles a day some days more some days less\nEveryone at a I spoke with was determined to reach the United states of all the people I spoke with only two said they

what Republicans have done a terrible job of controlling spending and I'm the first one to point the finger so Republicans without him Democrat\nAnd you don't think the president should be leaning on those Republicans a little harder on\nAs well yeah I think he should've beat out some of those spending bills Trump takes a lot of criticism from conservatives for not talking about Medicare and Social Security which is you know it was a big part of adding bicycled entitlement programs my feeling as one of the reasons Donald Trump won the election is precisely because he said he wasn't going

right corners of the Internet to mainstream conversation or even the president's Twitter feed\nThis question carries new urgency after the events of recent days after a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend\nThe suspect was an active user of the social media site gap where he posted his anti Semitic thoughts gas bills itself as a free speech alternative to Facebook and Twitter and is hardly the first place on the Internet where anti Semitism white nationalism and other extreme ideology spread\nWe spoke earlier this morning to will summer who thinks about all this a lot he reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast and he's actually tracked how conspiracy theories gained traction either well thanks for having me so what's a good example of how this for a short so for example I mean ...\nThe most obvious example right now is the the care of and the so called caravan coming out of Honduras or this is a the idea that this was some big men as a you know an invading hoard a it is something that really sort of bubbled up ah on on the dark as a edges of the right wing Internet\nOr with a lot of sort of hoaxes behind that and I you know they've been pushing this idea for a couple of months now and it's only really this month it's caught on so much so that the president is now sending troops to fight off that sort of non existent invasion\nNow I mean of course the president would say sending the military somewhere is a very important decision but but ... you are saying that you've been able to actually\nTrack this that the idea that this caravan is a menace was on some of these fringe sites and you could watch it work its way into the conversation and and sort of mainstream politics absolutely people\nDon't a analyses of this that show sort of like a you know starting on various Facebook pages read it accounts for channel ... which is a pro Trump Internet forum all these places and they kind of hit the hit the me enough in the message and then just in in the past week or two it really has caught on\nA you know a a representative Matt gates from Florida it was one of the big promoters of it and then from there it really took off\nAre there other examples where you've actually seen these sort of there's work their way as as high as you know top officials even the White House yeah I I I think some of the most\nFascinating stuff happens when these weird hoaxes a conspiracy theories effect actual policy so ah the president or claimed after twenty sixteen election that he had lost the popular vote because three million illegal votes were cast\nAnd you can draw a pretty direct line to that from that too and infowars article that had originally made that claim and then that claim then goes on to his fire the president to create the presidential voter fraud commission\n[noise] what what what who does something about this if if anyone I mean if if these conspiracy theories are not true if if some or all or many of them are not based on fact who rains descendants of the job of of the press than not these things down should fall to social media platforms to to regulate what's being shared their you\nKnow I I think it's an incredibly thorny issue I mean we've seen in the past when at a press tries to fact check things you often end up amplifying the hoaxes and spreading them around and you aren't really convincing the people who believe in them already a you know at this point I think people will kind of decided the ball is in the court of the social media companies\nBut you know they've been very reluctant to step in understandably into adjudicating political controversies so it it I think it's very sticky issue I think the companies right now are airing more on the side of a uh banning people and stuff like that and they were in the past\nAre we seeing a lot more than than we used to or has has always been going I mean it seems like something that is\nReally accelerated obviously we've had conspiracy theories for decades and and even before that a but it it it's really accelerated with social media and also I think uh the Internet and social media allows people to connect and reinforce wanted others belief in a way they couldn't really in real life\nWill summer reports on fringe right wing media for the Daily Beast joining us this morning on students in Washington where we really appreciate it effects rather\nPolitical odds makers identify dozens of congressional districts that are in play as it said could go either way and will determine which party

let's travel there with NPR's Brian Naylor\nThe second district of Maine stretches across a vast swaths of the state was deeply wooded forests and small fishing villages mostly rural it's not just the

deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk when voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by a Republican and come and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold ... government control your health care ending Medicare as we know sibling taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month the side of his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm ... I'm not\nGolden has repeatedly used or did he will not vote for below sea for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate public when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in ...

he says there isn't going to be one breakout moment but hopefully there will be many moments and the more stuff that's out there even the bad stuff the better\nThat's that is the flexibility under privileged that I think I'm white communities that is that they're allowed to fail in Hollywood and no one really bats and I it's like okay it's okay you can you can jump back up and it was thrown millions of dollars a gallon for you to do next project so that's the point that we have to go to\nIt's a struggle a lot of communities of color and minorities face in Hollywood\nThe two thousand Eighteen Hollywood diversity report from UCLA found that despite progress minorities are still under represented in key jobs from lead actors to directors to writers right now there's an appetite for shows about Muslims in part because some writers like our ... who's written on Modern Family in outsourced are creating their own content\nAnd their support for it he got a grant from pop culture

women are chattel and don't have identities or Muslim only portrayed as the gas station owner or the taxi driver a lady says it's an uphill battle but today the list of characters on mainstream television is longer than she's ever seen\nA Muslim surgeon on Grey's Anatomy a superhero on D.C legends of tomorrow\nA DVD cue jabbing\nMuslim on on the boat type a pork loving alcohol drinking the

that use the term ... which means God is great\nSo you've seen many TV and film projects that have long walk about being used in very violent scenes\nHow they negotiate for studios to try to get them to change it translated or offset it with happy scenes like saying God is great at a wedding or a dinner party because for Muslims it's a beautiful phrase portrayed as ugly\nYou know so someone Sears look but when they're dining out and all of a sudden you know they're calling nine one one because they think of family is doing something bad when all they're saying is God that was a damn good meal

foster brothers actually stopped me one night he asked me some questions you know what I thought about God and he worked at me from their own and eventually down to the point where you know I was going to church every Sunday\nBut his vote for Trump wasn't about religion or party again it was about this deep personal belief that Trump could make everything right for him this young man making ten twenty five an hour and trying to build a life with his partner two years later he is starting to feel some balance [noise]\nI kind of question myself a little bit on on that decision that I made on voting for him I mean\nI'm not really seeing the results yet things started getting a little bit more expensive I mean I'm surprised how much milk went up that was a big one for me I God I Love milk I like chocolate milk I drink it all the time and prices on things started going up and it's like why is that happening\nIn fact milk prices have largely gone down in Missouri since Trump became president but if Alex is paying more at his store and he uses that as a measure of this president it goes to show the kind of expectations he has\nYou know this man was supposed to be able to fix everything make everything get better make prices go down you know quantity go up quality go up and we're not really seeing results from that\nAnd the tariffs decision that that hit your workplace did that affect what you think of him\nYeah it kind of did whatever his reasoning for trying it than the timing was bad\nI feel like it ended up doing more damage to the economy and to America has a whole

Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are all week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just left his post the new White House counsel hasn't taken over a there's an acting person in that slot so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to serve as it may be a little bit of vapor where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check it a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get\nEighty five years of benefits uh the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\nWell that's right and we're talking about sort of two phenomenon one is a babies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a nation\nA phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to us specifically for the purpose of having children\nShould say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order is a is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nAnd that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boat so I'm going to try scooter [laughter]\nHe may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this has catnip to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley\n\nServices for the victims of the mass shooting at the tree of life

C. days before an election in which he wants to immigration to be a major issue President Trump has a new way to talk about immigration\nYou gave an interview to actually goes in what she said that he is interested in the idea of ending birthright citizenship that's the legal concept that someone born in the United states or to a U.S citizen is also entitled to be a citizen\nIt was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to do well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to ... it's ridiculous and it has to end\nThere was a lot in that bit of video including a number of statements that are false notably the president is wrong to say that the United states alone grants birthright citizenship many countries around the world do including Canada now let's talk about this with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley Scott\nGood morning Steve why is the president focused on this\nWell uh it it seems to be conveniently time for the midterm elections which are just a week away today\nThis was an idea that was floated by Donald Trump and and some other candidates during the twenty sixteen a campaign and here we are in late twenty eight team and we have seen a zero public activity towards actually acting on something like this\nUntil now we are a week out from the mid term elections the White House counsel who would presumably play a role in\nDrafting an order like this as just a left his post the new White House counsel has taken over a there's an acting person in that flood so it it seems suspicious that something like this is actually going to surface it may be a little bit of vapor where like the president's ten percent middle class tax cuts oh a conveniently arises before the midterm and that has never seen or heard\nFrom again I I guess we should fact check a little bit of what we just heard the president say there and it is something he said during the campaign complaining that someone who was known as an anchor baby would come here and be born on us soil and therefore get\nEighty five years of benefits or the reality is in many cases of course that person grows up and goes to work and work the job and creates a value for the economy correct\n[noise] well that's right and we're talking about all that sort of two phenomenon one is a\nBabies born to people who are living in the U.S illegally and then secondly there's a a a nascent a phenomenon known as birth tourism where you have wealthy immigrants coming to the U.S specifically for the purpose of of having children we\nShould say the fourteenth amendment is very explicit all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject the jurisdiction thereof are citizens or whether you can challenge that through an executive order as it is a pretty constitutionally dubious\nProduction that's what I Want to ask about Scott Horsley the president says there on the video he says okay so it's in the constitution but some people think you can do it with Congress so I'm going to try and executive order that seems to me like he was saying\nUm you need a plane to cross the Pacific ocean but some people think you can do it in a row boats so I'm going to try scooter [laughter]\nHe may try it and this certainly face a quick a constitutional challenge\nAlthough as you point out he hasn't done it yet is the thing he's raising his discussing days before an election\nAnd this is cutting it to the anti immigrant faction within the GOP\nAll right Scott thanks so much really appreciate it You're welcome to That's NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley\n\nServices for the victims of the mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh begin today and that includes a service for two brothers for many in Pittsburgh Jewish community the event will begin to form a period of mourning for victims of this shooting as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports it's a process that's carefully guided by Jewish tradition\nThe two brothers who will be laid to rest the soul and David Rosenthal were in their fifties the two youngest victims people who knew them said the brothers had intellectual disability and that they were well left by their congregation in one of Pittsburgh Jewish neighborhoods\nI think everybody in scroll Hill New\nNow sharing ride Brody owns the routes sugar capital a funeral home that serves mostly Jewish families in Pittsburgh\nI don't know anybody that didn't know that and they had a smile and a hotdog or a way\nFor everybody ... son has been constantly ringing in the wake of the shooting that killed their Rosenthal brothers she deals with death every day but this isn't normal\nYou don't deal with a tragedy like this every day thank God um but it's our duty and it's an honor to be called by my community service will do whatever we need to do to help everybody get through this\nRabbi Chuck diamond who wants to lead the congregation that tree of life says rabbis has been going to the more to be with the bodies in the days since the shooting\nWas so we're we're not supposed to leave the body alone and we have people who come in and guards them can be with them while they're there they pray they say psalms and so it was just somebody should pass from this world by themselves and it's an honor someone for everybody who's who's involved in it\nDiamond says that ritual washing up the body is also part of the Jewish tradition to prepare for burial\nAnd that's what we call the great myths of great commandment to great good thing that we do it's very difficult thing to\nBurial traditionally takes place quickly in Judaism ideally within a day or two that timeline has been pushed back slightly because of the criminal investigations surrounding the shooting\nThere's a real desire to return to a sense of a routine and and normalcy\nRabbi Aron business is the senior rabbi at congregation wrote ... which is hosting the Rosenthal funeral today he explains the thinking behind a quake burial which is traditionally followed by a week of intense morning\nEven this that won't be immediate you want to get that under way that process so there were not wallowing in our grief or we're not stuck in suspended animation as we'd anticipated burial bits of some later date\nAnd funeral director says there will be heavy security and she'd expecting an enormous crowd one of the people who will be there is Marcia your um Kramer
