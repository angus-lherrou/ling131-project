economy then the president's\nCongress or workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace tech Hi Molly Hayes of brie so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy\nDoes this make sense to you or are Americans over estimating the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified result snake crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican and democratic or the people at some point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent wasn't majority but six to eight percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies then we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seem policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm Federal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole it's a big summit and Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size\nHow they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so\nIt is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans are concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because frankly that's the only thing that's going to push them in that direction\nBollywood host a marketplace tech thank you so much thanks very\nYou can check out more Edison

is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how it was important well it's important to remember that\nIf Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts Saudi Arabia or frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the trend line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nWe are selling Saudi Arabia I'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting is that we just er into a level of arms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did\nA a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thanks you senator thank you\n... it was well known among western journalists who have covered Saudi Arabia and the broader region among them NPR's Deborah Amos that has been reporting from Saudi Arabia for decades her first took their was back in Nineteen Ninety One and she joins us now thanks for being with us ...\nThank you what went through your mind as you read this final column from ... in the Washington Post\nYou know in a way for me it felt like an obit for a man who was passionate about free media\nYou know he spent so much of his life in newsrooms and I remember his disappointment a few years ago when a TV station he opened in Bahrain was closed in twenty four hours he put a prominent dissident in his first newscast ... and so the powers that be shut them down\nYou know what turns out to be our last conversation he wanted to build an Arabic version of public television for the region and he said he had the money to do it for the first time in his career the Washington Post gave in this remarkable platform the post also translated his columns into Arabic which extended his reach\nBut it may have been the reason for his demise\nBecause as you note so he was working for the post\nAnd now that his columns had been translated you think that that angered the Saudi regime\nI think it's possible you know it's one thing to criticize in the west it's another thing to do\nIt in Arabic I'm it's much more powerful\nSo as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger on not just at the regime but in in particular at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin some on can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be [noise]\nKnow he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nA his older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you know who own money who was in trouble\nUm Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom of conservative religious ... into the modern age but she's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also arrested royals and a crack down on corruption holding them and like the a fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd sound\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nA Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban or many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know at the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him [noise]\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria um you know we saw with the son of a Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers I'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning\nOn the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed bin Salman is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question are you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance\nNow beginning to say the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security\nTo allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released what happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on this\nRight NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much that thank you and we close today with the words of ... ... ... in\nHis last column for the Washington Post he criticizes Arab regimes for cracking down on the free press saying these actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by

Netherlands prime minister mark route to NPR ... and has been following all of this from Brussels she's with us now ... good morning Noel so we should not under play at this summit there were some high expectations that this might finally seal of Brexit deal right\nYes that was definitely characterize as the make or break of whether there would be an a brags that deal\nA instead everybody backpedaled a and in fact uh some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how relaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen wow that is some telegraphing fares so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same old issue that's been holding up this deal for for many months now and that is what happens between uh the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom\nYou know do you put a hard border there and do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten the peace deal so they don't want that\nBut they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that Porter how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWe'll see you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this did you bring anything\n[noise] uh she did not um but ah what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't

example is estimating more than a hundred and ten billion dollars in Costa they would incur um if if brags that were to happen in terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nHow likely is that cash to happen at this point\n[noise] well everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic it won't happen that they come to a deal up possibly a in December so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point in negotiators have to come back to the table and try to hammer out something that

heard that advice before it actually feels a little out of step these days that you should have discuss politics or religion in polite company like I said considering what's in the news these these days that can be pretty hard to pull off\nSo can we keep critically important conversations going and still keep them polite Denise in rock rock winner central Texas life in a relationship coaches certified by an international\nCoaching federation accredited program and they say yes you can just add to the mid term elections we talked about why these conversations can gets ugly intent and how to take them a bit while still holding strong to believe\nThe decisions that are made they moved the direction and the flow of our society so we very much tie in our opportunities in our lack there of or disadvantages for ourselves as well as the next generation and and also there's something about the political realm that also speaks greatly to morality\nAnd what we really believe or see as being a right or wrong [laughter] fair or unfair\nIt seems like our discussions about politics they get heated people are passionate about them and it seems like\nThey come up to a line though and then they\nCross the line on the line is sort of civility and respect why do we cross the line\nInstead of allowing the other person to have their truth they want to be right and\nMost people get frustrated when you can get an individual to understand what it is that you believe or what it is that you're trying to say\nIt's not our role in this world and on the planet to be understood you speak your truth you hold your position and you let it settle because the more that we fight to get someone to understand our point of view were raising our defenses which\nYou know just by function of human nature they're going to raise their defenses mistakes just keep getting higher and higher we see people that don't speak any more we see people um that have parents that their conversations are now very have great brevity\nBecause bad believe this and son believes that I think that we have to get secure\nEnough and our individual identity that it's not rely on someone else seeing hearing her validating us and being secure enough to say I can sit with you I can share space with you even if I just agree with you back and so on are you\nWhat is the goal when we get\nInto a conversation that escalates about politics\nWe live in the world was constantly trying to change I'm only ourselves with other individuals are people are going to be who they are going to be and sometimes people make a new decision\nBut it's going to be very difficult for you to change someone else's mine are the best methodology to keep things at peace to keep things in respect to share your truth allowed them to have their truth and move on from there\nAnd what ever happened to responses and set up when someone makes a point instead of looking for a counter response or a bottle are sitting there and and\nNodding our heads and at that same time we're like stewing in our head we're not even hearing and we're just waiting for our response we're collecting I gather all our data\nWhatever happened to say\nTell me more about that oh I I hear you oh that sounds tough that's interesting I never thought of it like that giving feedback that creates connection and engagement rather than a ... bottle or defense is is everything doesn't have to become a courtroom\nToday it seems like one of the ways to bring some more respect to these discussions is to listen it also allows us to\nTake a little bit of our power back 'cause every time we get angry and get limited and lose our sense of self because someone doesn't agree with us we're kind of giving over a piece of our power to them and letting them walk away with it and it doesn't\nNecessarily have to be that way\n[noise] and you have to actually so what's going on internally because it is it really just about the politics if you're blowing up and you're getting furious about\nA political believe there's something else going on there at that point is is really about the politics or is it something internally that you need to get out is is there some anger that you're holding whipping but and this was the way that you choose to express\nHow do you Marshall forces within yourself to listen to and respect somebody who holds the belief that you honestly think it's harmful and bad to a lot of people I Do think that this has to be a way\nOf life like letting go of anger letting go of fear women go judge letting go on judgment letting go of the need to control I think it happens on on highway thirty five who are stuck in traffic I think it happens when the ...\nThe person brings back or order and it's incorrect and we're in a rush to get back to where we need to go I think it happens we're talking to her partner are spouse\nThey say something about us and we don't agree and we don't see in that moment can we say you know what I really appreciate you sharing that with me I don't see it that way but you tell me more about that practicing being grounded and letting those defenses goats learned\nBehavior and the brain has to be retrained because our primitive rain is like fight fly to freeze and we hear something that we feel threatened even an intellectual conversation we may not be physically threatened that we feel intellectually I'm or emotionally threaten\nPolitical differences in any kind of really strongly held differences can really impact relationship so how can a relationship system expanding allow for differences of opinion with out\nDisappearing I think that it's really important to lead to be clear a more each person stands within that relationship\nThey're always going to be differences and sometimes those real tight sometimes those are necessary in a relationship [noise] here's where you can test your group is how you bounce back\nTo you have those discussions and ... you know how quickly gave us how resilient you've ... you've how quickly through your bounce back from those arguments disagreement\nWe have to really focus on the commonalities as well and his cliches that sounds like focus on what is working 'cause you know big door swing on small ... so what are the key things that are keeping their relationship intact those are the things that focus on knowledge the things that do not that we're there isn't a missile I met or you don't agree but don't let that become the over arching focusing\nIn relationship was about boundaries maybe you have a political free zone in this setting after dinner table or you know whatever it is that you decide as a couple this was an old politics or we don't discuss politics in this particular space right that we used 'em at least have a safe space within your home\nLike if someone has a belief or an idea we don't have to try and shame the perfect believe you think that same and blame it just creates a cycle that never really ever get satisfies right Jim nice and rock rock ... thank you so much for your time and your discussion\nToday thank you Jennifer you\nCan few of those discussions about politics by keeping up with

officials say the Saudi Government murdered him by President Trump says the U.S needs more evidence before holding the Saudis responsible\nWe've asked for it if it exists rises I don't know I'm not sure yet they didn't exist probably does possibly the\nTurkish media reported the existence of a recording yesterday it allegedly captured the last moments of ... life\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has denied any involvement in the disappearance but some lawmakers are calling for Saudi Arabia to be held accountable Senator Chris Murphy is one of them he's a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations committee to morning senator\nMorning do you feel certain that you know what happened to ...\nI don't know that without the evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say that I feel ...\nUm but ah I see no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest that show is alive or everything that I have seen 'em that spoke publicly available and privately available\nAll leads me to believe that the Saudis ... uh unfortunately murder to show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specific place\nWell the first thing we asked is for the president should do don't investigation and who's responsible and sanction individuals that it believed order\nA this execution and so that process is under way the president fired by law to report to us on is finding a but Congress can act on its own and I I Would argue\nThat we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries of that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think that these she should be linked is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians\nWith their bombing campaign given the fact that they are likely lying to us about what happened to show the I think that it is likely to air also lying to us some help in line to us for a long time about what they are doing inside Yemen article as many others have but they are in fact\nTargeting civilians inside Yemen with the United states bombs with the United states a system that is the case that we shouldn't be any part of that coalition than it would be a important message to send to us that if you're not telling the truth oh we're not going to be in business\nYou have been making this point about Yemen and civilian deaths there and us involvement potential involvement in Yemen for some time but you are legislation to stop the U.S support for Saudi Arabia in that war hasn't gained much traction\nWhat makes you think that this specific case of of an and allegedly murdered journalist might make any kind of difference might be a tipping point\nWill I Will admit I Am very frustrated that United States is going assisting Saudi Arabia and killing thousands of civilians inside Yemen hasn't gotten much attention until the\nMurder of ... this journalist by getting attention now because of that you are linked because\nWe'd have supported Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign because we have to leave them because when ... when all these civilians were being killed they told us it was by accident even though all you suggested otherwise and so I think and I've been making is to my colleagues for years but because I was telling us the truth\nI'm there in fact on to us and I now think that many of my colleagues eyes are being open to the prospect that\nI'm a Mohammed bin Salman has not been straight in the United states about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about what happened to demolish rugby\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and to question experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to geo political stability in that region are those risks enough too\nStay the hand of the United states\nWill this idea that the United states more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how he was in ...\nWell it's important to remember the if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on oil than we were in the past\nAnd and I would also argue that we need to look at a broader scope of the train line arms sales to Saudi Arabia of when you're selling Saudi Arabia I'm much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting that we get on to a level of\nOn sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator among\nAssociated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied\nNo but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame is a GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied midterm elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year\nIt'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nAnd vote for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nProbably not but ... thinks maybe things will change as more people moved to the Austin area from other parts of the country\nAnd I'm a transplant so I you know it's kind of a curiosity to that I brought with me here and said I Wonder why\nMaybe one day we'll reach a critical mass of transplant to Austin demanding

Treasury Department said yesterday that China has not been manipulating its currency marketplaces Nancy Marshall ... in Washington\nNippy how does the Treasury Department decide who is manipulating their currency and who is not\nTreasury looks at a few things including whether a country has a quote significant trade surplus with the U.S and intervenes repeatedly to drive down the value of its currency traders says Chinese did not meet all those criteria it even says China has worked recently to slow depreciation\nWhat the us is is still unhappy with China right\nAbsolutely treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday he's\nConcerned about quote China's lack of currency transparency that trace report says China's currency the un has fallen by more than seven percent against the dollar just since last June and the reason this is so important is when the value of a country's currency falls it's imports get cheaper\nSo the fall of China's currency has taken a bite out of

like apple Amazon and Google have greater sway over the economy the president or Congress where workers Molly Wood is the host of marketplace stuck Hi Molly\nHayes debris so this was a big majority Seventy eight percent of Americans say financial institutions and tech companies have a great or good deal of influence over the economy does this make sense to you or are Americans\nThat's made him the power of talking big finance\nYeah I mean I think there's a couple of things that are interesting about this one is that it was a very unified results they crossed all the demographic lines it was male or female it was Republican and democratic or the people that Edison point out though that it's not unusual for\nPeople in America to think that companies have a great deal of power what's notable is that it was only about sixty eight percent was a majority but six to eight percent of Americans said the president and Congress have similar amounts of influence on the U.S economy so it does speak to the sort of\nThe mix of perception and reality about the power of these companies\nWe ascribe a lot of power to these large companies and we put a lot of pressure on these companies for example a Bernie Sanders has pressed Amazon to raise wages eventually did are they leading or are they having a lot of attention drawn to themselves\nI think we are increasingly seeing policymakers start to ask the very real question about how much influence these huge companies do have on our economy in fact I'm\nFederal Reserve and economic policy makers in Jackson Hole at the big summit and Jackson Hole we're talking about the impact of tech companies partly because of their sheer size and how they're starting to have economic impact that actually goes beyond what policymakers can necessarily do\nWe also asked people about the spread of false information on tech platforms in Seventy four percent in our poll say they are worried about it tech companies have had to answer questions on this and are out there promoting their efforts to do something about it you've been reporting on a lot on this are the tech companies taking this concerns seriously\nI think these companies are taking these concerns seriously but not to the extent that it would\nDamage the business model I guess and so it is notable and increasingly important then you have this many Americans concerned\nNevertheless I think the response of the tech companies does seem to be in direct proportion to the amount of concern and outcry about it and so it is really important for Americans to say that they're concerned about it and they want these platforms to do better because frankly that's the only thing that's going to push them in that direction\nBollywood host a marketplace ...\nThank

S. right he'd been in Virginia yes for a year he had had come he'd been there before he'd been a spokesman at the embassy\nBut he was a Washington Post journalist she was a resident of the United states he had a profile in Washington often at think tanks you know I'm beginning to think that he knew every journalist in town and most of the people who are covering this story\nKnew him [noise] so as we have heard took us a Turkish officials are pointing the finger or not just that the regime but in in particular the crown prince of Saudi Arabia uh Mohammed bin some on can you explain his rise to power what kind of leader he is proving to be [noise]\nYou know he came on the scene when he first arrived we didn't even know how old he was\nHis older brothers have advanced degrees from the west but the crown prince he stayed by his father's side in the kingdom when his father was the governor of Riyadh and back then his father actually wasn't enforcer within the family he was in charge of the paychecks for the royals and he knew you\nKnow who own money who was in trouble um Mohammed bin someone's rise has been very quick um and his\nSort of his goal is to move the kingdom at a conservative religious kingdom into the modern age what he's done it with incredible brutality and a\nA he has no tolerance for critics he has arrested many are in the kingdom he has also a rested royals and a crackdown on corruption holding them and like the fancy hotel for weeks and weeks at a time yes indeed and everybody had to pay up to get out\nYou know I think that there was some discomfort about that in the business community and the west but mostly it was like an odd Saudi thing to\nJail people in a five star hotel he also jailed\nOf Saudi women are these are activists who had been pushing for the end to a driving ban\nUh many of them are still in detention no charges we know nothing about what is happening with them so you know the same time he was fed in the west he was building this\nUm you know structure for a stamping out dissent but what does the west seeing him and in particular what does President Trump seeing him [noise]\nHe is you know there's this myth of the of the young reformer we sought a earlier in Syria or you know we saw with the son of Moammar Gadhafi a you know young men who are about to take over from their fathers they have modern educations\nAnd sometimes it turns out they are as brutal as as their fathers\nI'm In this case I think uh Mohammed bin Salman sold himself in the west as\nA man who was going to change Saudi Arabia who's going to move the economy and in particular open up the social space for Saudis what he never said was he was going to ... politically liberalize the kingdom and that for certain he has not\nAnd I think that that is now dawning\nOn the west as as this story unfolds what is in his future as far as you can discern I mean some in Congress now what President Trump to reevaluate weapons deals with the Saudis same thing is happening in Europe is is there a chance king saw him on decides that Mohammed been someone is too volatile and replacing them\nYou know I still think it's too early to uh to even answer that question a you know on the one hand I'm Talking to a lot of Middle East analyst who when this all started said no there's no chance now beginning to save the crown prince is toxic the king is going to have to consider some replacement\nBut it's also possible that the king and certainly the White House sees that this relationship is too important to us national security to allow the death of one journalist to alter where Saudi Arabia is now I I think we have to wait and see how the investigation goes is that tape released\nWhat happens in the White House to really see where the king will go on this right NPR's Deborah Amos uh she's been reporting on Saudi Arabia for years thank you so much debt thank you\n\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News and you are listening to

threats are nothing has been following all of this from Brussels she's with us now ... good morning Noel so we should not under play at this summit there were some high expectations that this might finally seal of Brexit deal right\nYes that was definitely characterized as the make or break of whether there would be an a brags that deal a instead everybody backpedaled a and in fact uh some of the the leaders of the ... went out for beer and and French fries to sort of underscore how\nRelaxed they were at this point and how they had no expectations anything was going to happen wow that is some telegraphing right there so what went wrong exactly\nWell it's the same issue that's been holding up this deal for for many months now and that is what happens between\nUh the republic of Ireland which is part of the emu and Northern Ireland which is a province in a United Kingdom you know do you put a hard border there do you not uh people are very concerned if there is a hard border there that it would threaten the peace deal so they don't want that\nBut they just can't come to an agreement where they should put the boarder who should run that Porter how the customs union would work and it just they don't seem to be getting any closer on that point\nWell the ... you had explicitly asked Theresa May to come to Brussels and give them some new ideas that would help and all of this uh did you bring anything\nOr she did not um but ah what's really interesting is that there seems to be a lot of sympathy for her even though she didn't uh for example to lug simmered prime minister ... said he realizes that prime minister May's in a tough spot at least one point she realizes that\n[laughter] you know the trees on movies is tricky situation because she saw huge crushing into you

borders basically you know have security people to to vet people with passports coming through\nA you're talking about way uh increased costs to various countries Germany for example is estimating more than a hundred and ten billion dollars in Costa they would incur um if if breaks it were to happen in terms of increased taxes and that sort of thing\nUh so it's it's just something that nobody wants on either side of this equation\nHow likely is that cast to happen at this point\nWell everyone is still saying that they are cautiously optimistic it won't happen that they come to a deal or possibly in December so it's something that they're going to work towards at this point the negotiators have to come back to the table and try to hammer out something that everyone can live with\nSo

Israel and their relationship to lonely souls finding one another in New York City is so much a part of this movie now Melissa McCarthy never met the real Lee Israel in researching her she came to lover\nEven after she was caught and and convicted I Love that she never she would not take back to work to you know this may not have been the right thing to do but that work with good my work was good and I won't negate that and there's something so independent about that but I think that's I don't know it made me love our\nLeaders real dyed in twenty fourteen and she left behind almost no photographs and so Melissa McCarthy had to rely on stories from people who knew Israel like actors drinker\nShe was at a party in Manhattan with her husband\nAnd someone just kind of came in the door and like it she said it was just this disruption not necessarily noise but just like\nWell like muttering and just she was like almost just energy wise of people kind of clearing and moving and interrupting conversations and\nWent through got some food got a couple like pounded a couple of drinks and like what right back out the door Jane Curtain was describing the zoo and she said it was ... she was being as once she left she turned to yet either a husband or somebody at the party and said who the hell was that\nMost of McCarthy said she had a lot of fun becoming a character who breaks the law but who you really want to root for\nSo many of my characters have been very like energy out they're the ones that kind of not the room down but leave really directed at all to the interior I kept thinking leaves an armadillo like\nShe was always kind of putting an arm or to protect yourself and to be a little bit more invisible\nIt seemed like New York become such a character I just think about your apartment and the British streets and the the angry but lovable superintendent you're building and the bars of diners like it was that was that important and did you play a role in in creating that New York around you\nKnow ... I mean Mari did such an amazing job this is Marie ... yeah it is yeah Maria ... who is awesome\nFor someone who is there and that's like such a part of who I Am today because of that New York and other people that I Know we're in New York City that have seen the movie so far it's like we all felt like I got really kind of\nOverwhelmed one night we were just out on the streets shooting something where it's like just walking long about to go down the subway and everything about it I'm like no one was cell phones the block you know trying to find New York to look like that now is really difficult so she would find these little sliver as\nOf different neighborhoods where she was like it is an touched it hasn't been you know cleaned up and pretty it it looks like it really did and we would go to these places and that was just like I feel like you gave me\nBack this like magic time in my life and I've talked to a lot of people that are like it gave us back our New York that we had\nIs there are ... you remember in your life like that you connect to this character in a way that reminds you of any one\nI did I mean almost all of my friends in New York City we're\nKind of fantastic gay fellows in in that time it was like so many people I knew had come from smaller towns where they could not be who they were they didn't feel safe they didn't feel comfortable they couldn't tell their families\nSo I had so many friends that were kind of like experimenting and trying to figure out like who were there and what does it mean to suddenly be twenty and in New York City and out\nIs tricky things still are in Nineteen Ninety you know that was a long way from what it is today and that plus you know the AIDS epidemic that we see jak struggle with at the end is like\nIt's just such a part of that city is such a ... a of conflicting part of your finally here you're out you can be and do whatever you want and then at the same time this crisis of like except it's like killing all of these men\nDid you learn anything about yourself from this wrong in this film [noise]\n\nI think for me it it made me really try to remember more like to look up and see people here's this amazing ridiculously talented interesting difficult\nFascinating woman and most people pastor by on the street and she was invisible so I Do feel like I look differently as in passing people and I think what is your story or what do you amazing at like who loves you who do you love what do you miss what breaks your heart like\nI Try to link is never know if it sounds strange would make more I contact\nAnd I do really think that there's an effective if one person really looks at you and the day that can change the whole trajectory of your day\nAnd then maybe you're weak and maybe you look at one other person and connect that humans and to have someone no they've been seen I think\nCan do a lot more than I had remembered and cat\nThat was Melissa McCarthy her new movies and you never forgive me ...\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Jennifer state and and this is Austin's NPR station K.

though many my own and struggle with service related trauma it's a group with the high suicide rate to address that\nBut the VA last summer's started a new program this group of veterans can come into the VA and be treated for mental health issues at least for Ninety Days\nWe asked the VA how many people use the program and the first year the agency gave us figure showing that nationally one hundred and Fifteen veterans did a fraction of the veterans who would now qualify for mental health care twenty five of those patients were in San Diego sector Neal door news with the San Diego VA\nBecame an unfair that they had an urgent made and and they were evaluated and received care for for that urgent need whether it was a substance use disorder or suicidal thoughts\nVeterans

push through legislation that will require the VA to treat with other than honorable discharges Murphy says as long as their mental health issues are related to their service\nIf you have the man because of that is the you act out you should not lose eligibility for your veterans' benefits that's what's been happening\nThe new law also and the Ninety dig cap which some veterans advocates say made the program even harder to navigate and it requires the VA to seek out people who qualify that means service members leaving now but\nAlso hundreds of thousands who left with less than an

United States about other things I'm just like he is not straight with the United states uh about what happened to democracy\nSenator as you well know there are risks that come with calling the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and to question I experts will point to Saudi Arabia's oil experts will point to deal political stability in that region are those risks enough to stay the hand of the United states\nWill this idea that the United states has more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous\nI'm ... and how is important\nWell it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on foreign oil than we were in the past\nUm and and I would also argue that we need to look at the broader scope of of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia um we're selling Saudi Arabia\nI'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting that we just were burned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy Democrat of Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thanks you senator\nI keep saying\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied\nNo but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame is a GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nNot only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nA vote for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "18"}
