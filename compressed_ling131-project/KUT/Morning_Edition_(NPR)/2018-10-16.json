they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the the nice thing is when it comes to a disaster of the scale one organization alone can can't do it and we're very thankful that there are such rate other partner agencies a NGOs a local\nAre folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence or to try to bring a relief and a basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nThere's always that group of folks that\nDon't end up leaving they don't heed the call to evacuate or for whatever reason fact I talked to two gentlemen yesterday uh who have been in this area for years surviving you know several other hurricanes that have come through general one category choose even a three\nAnd they'd be you know what we came to that just fine uh I think with the realization was as this thing

not really a threat you spoke of punishment if the Saudis were responsible and by Monday he leaned into the you know raising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring reissue NPR White House

to get to the bottom of it very serious but is really a flat denial\nIn just twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's

Government was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to halt us weapons deals over it\nJennifer a spindle is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which she joins us from morning\nTo morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell the Saudis exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point on the sea one thirty transport plane which that American transport play\nRight so it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there's a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets built military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region you\nKnow they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them are really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are up pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deal for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for a important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales to even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely would be possible and and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable\nThat Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that to friendly states and allies I'm under President Obama and August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel doesn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapon\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... ah the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nUnfairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable\nOh because they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer ... thanks so much thanks for having me she is an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely largely

would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs ... um that role exists a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates death records\nUh then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens in the country most of them live in our territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country where the largest traveling the country and we have a very rigorous process uh and it's a about documentation and\nDrives me back to that those rules you Amy genealogy going to get back to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation of one time why is beginning a relevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that trace you to native peoples in North American South America it's not going to tie you to a particular\nGroup of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind as you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nations we existed before the United states ah was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied a in part to federal treaties but this is a legal\nStatus a political ad is not a genetic status and that is a very important for folks in this country to understand was one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was before and said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people that will say well ah family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test\nOr does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a drive but I have Indian ancestry [noise] it\nDoes me first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being a Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her\nA family story [noise] um and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nA means by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA [noise] ah it really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's there was a couple of couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAre many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for\nThe status at the legal status that was nearly extinguished by the government the United states it's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and vote so they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific travel nation citizenship then there's this\nA question of Elizabeth Warren you mentioned that she has been criticized by President Trump who's referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should shoot not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand or issues\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on the Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them well\nWe think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was a was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone\nA it's a very critical tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat so I don't think he uh does what he ought to do is the president to raise the level of discourse in this country maybe to take the opportunity to to talk about Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWhile this was an opportunity to raise another issue that I think hardly has gotten talked about at all because there's so much news around the country uh there are a lot of Indian nations in this country you have close relations with the federal government dependent on the federal government and and in many ways how has the Trump Administration done for a for the Cherokee Nation last couple\nYou will in in some ways it's been positive we've made a lot of strides in healthcare um but there's a lot of uncertainty for example in the bureau of Indian affairs and whether the United states is going to consult with a silver changes to that agency that's so critical\nIt concerns is a time when there's proposed budget that reduce things that are important to his things to protect the environment that uh go to job creation\nOr education and things of that matter so um we need to we need a federal government that will listen to tribes will consult with tribes that will live up to its end of the bargain these are treaties these are trust obligations\nUh and so we think the federal government could be doing better but it certainly doesn't help when the person the United states a Texas senator or if a senator gets bogged down in DNA or the end result\nWell ms Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate it thank you very much Steve\n... is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation and

require drug makers to reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry\nKaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means mourning mourning what is this new proposal what exactly will let me\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month would need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different depending on our insurance and um we may have a detectable we have to fill so the question is what price will be up there on the secretary did know that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where\nUm nobody really pays that often and ... are made a point of saying that the price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but would it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing right consumers right so if I'm told that my drug is five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or\nMight adaptable covers it are my my health plan covers and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scary away from getting at drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so keen on\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that and it's kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the mid term ... um I Want to play out for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that ... price friends' parents and prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\nJust the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it pharmaceutical industry's response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group pharma\nAnd made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary\nMeasure where we ask our companies to um help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and cost of our drug and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the pharma industry on the offensive\nDuring the press call for that um somebody asked me ... is there was a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo I'm ... even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tool says the Trump Administration is administration how to enforce that\n[noise] so they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame them and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble senior correspondent with Kaiser Health news thank you so much thank you [noise]\nThere is no firm indication that the United states will act against Saudi Arabia for the suspected murder of a journalist but the Saudis may already be paying a price NPR's John Ydstie reports on what it means that businesses are backing away\nIn twenty sixteen crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon Saudi Arabia's affective ruler invited us and global businesses to a conference he unveiled a plan called vision twenty thirty\nIt called for a transition of the Saudi economy away from oil and toward a more diverse market based model and the crown prince invited the companies to participate\nJacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for international economics says the ... affair is undermining the crown princes vision\nNamely that the world's most advanced and competitive companies come and establish themselves in Saudi Arabia\nThat scenario is fading as the CEOs of large us and global companies one after another announced they will not attend the second vision twenty thirty conference scheduled for next week Jamie diamonds C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase has said he wanted it to him again Jacob Kierkegaard\nI think the fact that as CEO as prominent as you know J. P. Morgan Jamie diamond not going to the summit and saying so publicly and linking it to the ... disappearance means that many other CEOs will probably be pulled out\nTo other prominent Wall Street CEOs Larry fink of black rock and Steve Schwartzman of the Blackstone group also say they won't be attending\nAccording to New York times the trio of CEOs tried but failed to get the Saudis to postpone the conference the CEOs also reportedly failed to convince treasury secretary Steven mission to stay home\nThe ... the allegations along with previous behavior of the crown prince or making companies nervous says Kirkegaard\nHe says remember that back in twenty Seventeen the crown prince rounded up four hundred Saudi princes and businesspeople detained them it's a rich Carlton in Riyadh on corruption charges and force them to pay the government as much as a hundred billion dollars\nLive beginning at four o'clock right here on K U T Ninety point five Boston's NPR station and reminders\nYou can stay on top of what's happening around the world at the end of the day with news today from the b._b._c. World Service it's all the day's news the line from\nLondon Tonight at ten here on K U T Ninety points saw it six fifty wind\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep prominent authors meet for dinner in London Tonight they learn which of them received the man Booker Prize for fiction those off for the award include Canadian as we do jog whose novel is Washington Black\nYou know when you're starting a novel you really playing with character and and you're letting them interact and you're seeing what comes of it and at least for me as a writer I really have no idea where my story is going at the outset of it\nThat's her novel starts it seems the narrator is not going anywhere if the Eighteen thirties and he is a boy and slave on the British control violent but Barbados he seems likely to be worked to death and sugar cane fields van Washington Black has made an assistant a visiting white male who becomes is from going away\nAny true friendship between them is impossible because of a power imbalance in the relationship it's it's just too great\nYou have to white Englishman teaches Washington Black to read and draw he's revealed to be an almost super naturally talented artist soaking up knowledge that he was denied as a slave the novelist says she didn't plan for the store to turn out that way\nPart of what I was wanting to explore with this idea of I guess black genius as being something that obviously would have existed back then than you would have people with great gifts [laughter] but that this is something that would have been snuffed out a very brutally in without much thought [laughter]\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies [laughter] but you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of ah [noise]\nOf potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel um don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young man and his older white companion are going to skate Barbados they're going to get out of their uh did you need to get out of there get out of the slaves situation as a novelist for your own founding\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel when it really wanted to explore was his life post slavery and to show\nHow [noise]\nYou know by being physically free we think of that as being kind of the end of slavery well she's not in chains he's got the way he's physically free [laughter] but I really think that you know there had to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave\nEven while your free and body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma and probably a great sense of the will to him into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways of comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking you're going to be recaptured or church though uh another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent that\nIn a way he resents being freed you resents the white man are free to ah obviously if you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that I knew and dislocated up in a way\n[noise] yeah but I also think I think the main thing that he resents is the feeling that the men who freed him did not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that\nThis man made this great gesture of of helping him be free\nAnd yet he really has the sense that this man thought of himself as an abolitionist and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you in two thousand or ...\n[noise] I think we're still dealing with the obviously a lot of the themes in concerned that come up in the book [laughter]\nThings like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um people\nKind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um and how they [noise] they really had to [noise]\nNot only is sort of\nChanged their own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very sort of court t._v. in everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it wasn't going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with so to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to\nGalvanize a whole society to [noise] to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky I'm there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people a couple of times and\nExpressed baffled by the central I said I don't understand what it is the black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd they're they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of the history that you're laying out and find that to be old news\n[noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that to this exists [laughter] um\nTo me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say videos of um\nPolice officers\nGunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch the videos and still contend that there is not a problem and and some that we have racial inequality and in fairness that this is baffling to me [noise] uh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of\nPeople wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it and I think one of the things that novels can do\nIs to bring a reader into\nThe characters experience especially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy and Eighteen thirties Barbados a who's a sleigh but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you are like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him if he's going through these hardships if you couldn't do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy\n[noise] that'd be a new job as the author of Washington Black novel that's been short listed for the Booker Prize which we find out about\nToday Thanks so much thank you\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and

much thank Steve\nThere are several eight organizations on the ground there in the panhandle trying to help in this recovery effort the salvation army is one of them\nDavid ... is part of what ... his bottom in Panama City since Saturday in his on the line now a David good morning first of all thanks for making the time on a busy day one of several ...\nAbsolutely thank you Rachel great to be here can you just give us a sense of what you have been seen over the past few days\nAbsolutely a reporter will really summarize remembered Lee what are the scene is here just destruction all over the place\nUh in terms of what the Salvation Army has been doing which was within twenty four hours after the storm cleared out of here on Thursday or they'd been meeting the basic need by providing food in an hydration do not only survivors but first responders which is exactly what the Salvation Army does in the initial response of disasters so\nOr to this date right now what's the eighty thousand meals have been served a beverage locations around the animosity area\nYou were listening in on that conversation with our reporter there Quil Lawrence who said that all of a challenge she\nSaw or people who chose to stay who didn't evacuate and now they're stuck they're stuck in their houses they can't get to a a zones that where people can get relief are is the salvation army addressing that or are you are you seeing other organizations try to meet that need\nWell the the nice thing is when it comes to a disaster of the scale one organization alone can can't do it and we're very thankful that there are such rate other partner agencies are NGOs a local are folks who are who are also picking up a big me up the slack in essence\nOr to try to bring a relief and a basic needs to to those in those areas you know I think there's\nThere's always that the group of folks that\nDon't end up leaving they don't heed the call to evacuate or for whatever reason fact I talked to two gentlemen yesterday uh who have been in this area for years surviving you know several other hurricanes that have come through general one category choose even a three\nAnd ... you know what we came to that just fine uh I think with the realization was as this thing ramped up coming in and came in almost as a five and they realized too late that they made a huge mistake\nAnd they were led to escape with their lives but\nKnow that then this is now they've got to be able to eat not able to get water or not just for drinking but to be able to potentially flush the toilet I in fact we're all dealing with that including the salvation army personnel that are that are here in Panama City where we're living with them\nHow does this compare to other hurricane disasters that you've been a part of or ... or ...\nSure uh I was here in Florida last year as part of the hurricane Irma relief I was in a sea brings Florida and the issue there was more just widespread power outages didn't see a ton of damage\nOh so the folks obviously powers out you can't cook you know there's no food to buy so that's where the salvation army comes in and provides that that need that food and hydration but here I I actually came into\nTallahassee last Thursday spend a day and a half there and as I moved west and then further south to come here that's when you saw the tremendous destruction was running along interstate ten west you know you have those swab along the along the highway and\nYou know hundreds and hundreds of them just snapped and have the ones that didn't break were just bend it forty five degrees of I've never seen anything quite like that this is the worst than I ever see in terms of a major storm\nYeah David Yarmuth we have to leave it there he spoke to us on Skype\nThank you Rachel among\nPresident Trump made headlines we have the day when he spoke of severe punishment for the suspected murder of a journalist by Saudi Arabia but here's a question when you're listening closely what if the president really say his language showed this was not really a threat he spoke of punishment yes the Saudis were responsible\nAnd by Monday he leaned into the you know\nRaising doubts about Saudi involvement and blurring the issue NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports this is how the president often handles awkward news\nStanding on the south lawn of the White House President Trump described the conversation you had the Saudi king selmont about what happened to take a showcase\nBecame her only denied any knowledge of it he\nDidn't really know maybe I don't want to get a Jay's eyes but it sounded to me like babies instead of saying well you know look at it so I get to the bottom of it very serious but as long as a flat denial\nIngest twenty seconds Trump hit a trifecta phrasing and logic he comes back to frequently first when an ally or someone he's inclined to believe denies something he did first did they did not\nI've asked firmly denies that while he denies that mean Roy Moore denies it\nWay he gives a total denial\nI Will tell you that President Bush was extremely strong and powerful and his denial today\nThat was President Trump referring to the denials have king Solomon Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore who was accused of inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls and Russian President Vladimir Putin's\nDonald Trump is all of us we all do it I mean I Do that you did as\nEmily ... is a professor of political science at Syracuse University she says it can be somewhat jarring coming from the president because traditionally American presidents have been more restraint that with Trump that filter as off\nMy sense is that he's relying on stock phrases that he pulled out again and again especially when he's called on to make a statement that said that perhaps they haven't done a lot of research on our doesn't have a lot of information on\nWhich gets to the second thing Trump says regularly when confronted with potentially uncomfortable information or a difficult situation\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nThe fighting wasn't related to upcoming elections but the Taliban have promised to disrupt that process and the multiple some heinous attacks demonstrate have gone on sounds on her ability and also solid meeting in Qatar last week between Taliban officials and Washington

O'Rourke will debate tonight one final time before early voting begins Katie's been built pot explains three things to watch out for tonight\nThis debate is kind of a closing argument for both campaigns the last chance to convince undecided voters but not just undecided people which brings us to thing number one to watch for Republicans hold an advantage in Texas when it comes to likely voters\nSo if you work or any Democrat wants to win they'll need to get people who haven't voted in a long time or maybe ever before to come out\nSo watch for all work to make a pitch to younger voters and groups that haven't been as politically engaged like Hispanic voters\nWhich brings me to the second thing to expect plenty on immigration whether it's a debate on foreign or domestic policy both candidates will have plenty to say about the country's immigration policies from limiting refugee resettlement to whether immigration reform should include a pathway to citizenship\nThese candidates have polar opposite opinions across much of this topic\nAnd finally watch to see if either candidate start slinging mud time is short races closer than any statewide election in decades if

was suspected of having a journalist killed the president said he would look into that accusation but he wasn't willing to halt us weapons deals over it\nJennifer spin Dell is an expert in the international arms transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma from which he joined us come on a\nGood morning thanks for having major ... what does the U.S sell this out as exactly\nTo the U.S sells a lot of different weapons to Saudi Arabia um precision guided munitions helicopters missiles jets a wide range of weapons that we've sold to the Saudis in the\nPast you know we were recovering the Saudi involvement of the war in Yemen someone put us at one point on the sea one thirty transport plane which that American transport\nBut right\nSo it's American stuff all the way through does this make the Saudis dependent on the United states or is it the other way around\nYou know I think that there is a little bit of both Saudi Arabia definitely gets both military power and the degree of political support from being able to receive arms in the United states and equally I think the U.S in the past has been hesitant to stop arms sales for fear of angering Saudi Arabia and having that effect other U.S foreign policy goals in the region\nYou know they're not the world's biggest country but they're one of the world's richest countries does that make them a really lucrative market for weapons\nYou know you might think so but in general what we've seen is that arms sales are pretty inefficient employment mechanism part of that because sometimes weapons are given on grant or unfavorable credit terms um but you know in general this isn't like selling oranges are chairs or some other good there's a very different logic of both trade and politics\nThat means that arms sales aren't from this lucrative big deal for the United\nOh if you're talking about jobs which is what the president says he's concerned about you're saying there aren't actually that many jobs at stake\nThat's what we've seen in the past you know in a previously Saudi Arabia and signed a six billion dollar deals for Lockheed Martin helicopters and and that was supposed to support four hundred jobs so there isn't quite the direct correlation between the amount of money that we're told that these arms deals um amount to and the number of jobs that we see at home\nFor for important to those four hundred people but not not world changing for the U.S economy so so is it possible if the president wanted if he thought it was in us interest is it possible to halt arms sales even to an ally like Saudi Arabia\nYou know I think it absolutely wouldn't be possible and thinking about the broader political context that could be really important signal for the United states to send\nYou know that the abduction and murder of a show gee is not acceptable\nThat Saudi or human rights violations in Yemen with continued aerial operations are are not something that the U.S supports and there's actually precedent for the U.S doing that friendly states and allies I'm under President Obama in August twenty fourteen the U.S actually stopped the transfer of hellfire missiles\nPrecisely because of Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip that stoppage was supposed to signal us displeasure and that Israel they didn't have a sort of blank check to keep asking for us weapons\nAlthough President Trump has said hey wait a minute if I stop us arms sales because of concern about ... ... uh the Saudis will just buy them from the Russians or somebody else is that really possible\nI'm fairly skeptical that that could be feasible um opportunity for Saudi Arabia in arms sales you know us and Russian or Chinese systems don't talk to one another which means that would be really costly and time intensive for Saudi Arabia to buy and then learn new weapons systems these things aren't interchangeable all\nBecause they've already got so many of us weapons systems they would have trouble backing out of us weapons systems at this point\nExactly so the dependence works both ways they're\nJennifer spend del thanks so much thanks for having me she's an expert on weapons transfers and is at the University of Oklahoma\nPresident Trump talks about slashing regulations as one of his greatest achievements a lot of those regulations are connected to the environment Congress has largely gone along for the ride that may change this November though NPR's Nathan Rott reports on what a new Congress could mean for the environment\nThe environment is not typically a top of ticket issue for voters but this has not been a typical year\nMendocino Complex fire and those are ... now the largest in state history three million people at risk or extreme heat heat index is\nIn Florida is already making his presence along the Carolina coast\nNo none of this push the environment over issues like health care or immigration and the minds of most voters but it does make for easy messaging in states where the effects of climate change are already being felt cue B roll of raging wildfires\nGetting hotter but will fire and smoke ... here in a rural and longer is radically opposed to fight climate change global warming is a song\nAds like this has been appearing throughout California Florida and in swing districts across the country targeting Republican lawmakers it's part of a multimillion dollar effort by the league of conservation voters to flip the house Democrats turning sit and failed is a vice president with a conservation group\nIf we had in front of our allies leading the house of representatives they can do badly needed oversight on the Trump administer Asians efforts to cater to polluters every day over our communities\nThat word oversight is one you hear a lot from Democrats in part because there's not a whole lot else they can do most of the robotics and environmental policy are happening in the executive branch under Trump appointees shifted house leadership won't change that\nDemocrats can't force interior secretary Ryan Zinke you to restore Bears Ears national monument for example or to crack down on methane emissions but they can force him to explain himself\nArizona congressman Raul Grijalva is the ranking Democrat on the house natural resources committee\nI Want to change the narrative for this whole thing where the Resources Committee is not just the past ... part of the Trump Administration but the independent and the responsibility is co equals for oversight and accountability\nTranslation expect hearings lots of them if Democrats retake the house Tom pile heads the American energy alliance which supports Trump's agenda he says a Democratic majority in the house would be a setback for the administration\nAnd they would be able to tighten up mercilessly show that they were going to be able to slow walk a lot of the good work being done with respect to these issues\nWarren says the test shows native ancestry bought her announcement brought criticism from the Cherokee Nation and that prompted a celebratory statement from the president this morning who took the opportunity to call Warren Pocahontas again\nSo what did the Cherokees themselves\nReally think earlier we reached Chuck Hoskins junior a secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation\nWho called in from ... to Oklahoma I just want to note for people who maybe don't follow this everyday remind people that the Cherokee Nation as a sovereign nation it's been around since before the United states and you have people who live within of course the United states how do you determine today who is and isn't the Cherokee\nWell first of all we DNA is completely irrelevant to the process but our process is essentially that a a person living today would need to trace back to a turn of the twentieth century senses of Cherokee living in what was to become northeast Oklahoma\nThat's known as the dogs ... um that role exist a person can trace back to it if you trace back to that and document that proved through things like birth certificates debts records\nAre then you can establish yourself as a Cherokee citizen and we now have three hundred and sixty five thousand citizens and the country most of them live in\nOur territory in northeast Oklahoma and the surrounding area but we have citizens all over the country for the largest traveling the country we have a very rigorous process uh and it's about documentation and\nDrag them evacuated at those rules you Amy genealogy on a subject to people who were legally part of the Cherokee Nation at one time why is irrelevant to that\nWill DNA at best will tell you if there are markers and your genetic code that tray shoe to native peoples in North America and South America it's not going to tie you to a particular\nGroup of native peoples to particular tribe keep in mind you noted uh Indian tribes in this country are sovereign nation we existed before the United states\nUh was was exist in existence and so\nAs a sovereign nation we can determine our own citizenship rules and laws course those are tied\nOr in parts of federal treaties but this is a legal status a political ad is not a genetic status and that is very important for folks in this country to understand but one of the reasons we're concerned about\nBut let's talk about what it was with Warren said she specifically said I'm not enrolled in a tribe she says I have native ancestry and she's one of a lot of people who will say well a family stories as I have some Indian blood and people who apparently can take a DNA test or does it bother you when someone like Elizabeth Warren says I'm not a member of a try but I have Indian ancestry\nDoes I mean first of all it it I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories are being curious about their their DNA but you have to take Senator Warren statements in the larger context I mean she has told stories about being\nUh Cherokee hearing those stories growing up\nAh and then she is in a back and forth with the president United States of course is taking taking some personal shots at her for her\nFamily story [noise] um and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA ah really undermines tribal interest frankly because we're sovereign nation\nWell there's there's a couple of questions that are raised by that one of the general one of them specific in the general question is just about the really large number of people that\nAre many of us have encountered in everyday life who say they have some some native ancestry or they are they taking advantage of you in some way by not being members of the Cherokee Nation or whatever nation but saying that they have this this background\nWill often it is about a appropriating our identity and our culture um you know we thought long and hard for this status at the legal status that was nearly a extinguished by the government the United states\nIt's a legal status that we used to fight for the rights of native children to protect our lands and when someone comes in and boast that they took a DNA test so there Indian\nWe think that our roads what it means to be a Native American in this country even if they don't claim a specific travel nation citizenship\nThen there's the specific question of Elizabeth Warren you're mentioned that you've been criticized by President Trump has referred to her as Pocahontas to Pocahontas who challenged her to take some kind of DNA test should should not be able to respond to that at all\nI don't think she should go down to the level of that kind of name calling and that kind of attack what we want from leaders of this country has people to advocate and fight for Indian country to understand or issues [laughter]\nShe's in a great position to have a positive impact on Indian country that's where her focus should be the president United States should not be calling her Pocahontas he should be looking at what the needs of Indian country or because the needs are there we need folks in Washington to listen to that and to stand up for us\nOkay so what's wrong with the president of the United states calling her Pocahontas them\nWell we think that it's a Pocahontas first of all was he was a real person that had a real identity with a real tribesmen in if you listen to the tone it to the very drifts of tone I think it's a political back and forth that has little to do with the interest of Native Americans in this country has more to do with the political spat\nSo I don't think he uh does what he ought to do is the president to take the opportunity to to talk of an Indian country instead of just attacking senator\nWell ms Ross Kim thanks very much really appreciate it thanks very much

News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin the Trump Administration announced plans Monday that would require drug makers\nTo reveal the list price of their medicines and TV commercials the move effectively sets the stage for months or even years of battle with the drug industry Kaiser Health news senior correspondent Sarah Jane Tribble covers drug pricing and she's here to walk us through what this means morning good morning what is this new proposal what exactly will it mean\nSo what secretary aides are as a health and Human Services and to the Trump Administration he took the stage yesterday and he announced that any drug that costs more than thirty five dollars a month we need to have advertising on TV ads and the rule is rather specific it says they advertise needs to be on a contracting background and needs to be easy to read\nUp so there are a lot of questions embedded in that um what what price are they going to list in the TV commercials because based on how much people paying insurance the prices are different for different people right right\nExactly so when you go to the pharmacy counter and I go to a pharmacy counter our co pays maybe different be depending on our insurance and um we may have a doctor but we have to have ... so the question is what price will be up there um the secretary did note that they want less price up there which is\nI'm also a good question what does it mean um he clarified later and said it would be wholesale acquisition cost which is a an industry term where um nobody\nReally pays that often and ... days are made a point of saying that the list price does matter and he did this big analogy with the auto industry on cars and so forth\nAnd it does matter because it's a base for a lot of negotiation and it can be a base for what people who are uninsured pay but\nWould it matter to consumers though it can be off often confusing consumers right so if I'm told that my drug it's five thousand dollars a month just for example but I'm only going to pay a couple of thousand dollars a month or might adoptable covers it are my my health plan covers it and only paying fifty dollar co pay\nIt could scare you away from getting a drug right\nSo um even though it's it's kind of confusing it's still demanding a level of transparency that I imagine the pharmaceutical industry isn't so ...\nYeah and um and it is getting a lot of attention it's something that and it's kind of a populist thing that people can grasp on to\nAnd it is just a few weeks before the midterms um I Want to find out for the November election so the timing is a very exciting because people really care about prescription drug prices right now recent polling shows that a ... price friends' parents have prescription drug prices polls well with American voters\n... just the idea of it for you when you start companies to be more a forthcoming I'm so is it what's the likelihood that it actually is going to go into effect\nSo let me back up just a minute and say in the form it from the oil industry's response because I think that helps lead us to the likelihood of that going into effect so yesterday morning before um the secretary took to the stage and made this big announcement\nThe pharma industry through their trade group pharma and made a big announcement as well and they said hey we're going to do a voluntary measure where we ask our companies to\nUm help educate you about your price and we will help you know direct you on our website to information about the benefits and costs of our drugs and they're going to put together a Web portal that you can go and look and look at your insurance options and so forth okay so that was a kind of the farm industry on the offensive\nDuring the press caught for that um somebody asked hey is there is a possibility for litigation here and the industry didn't say no and I think it's a legitimate question and several law scholars that I spoke with yesterday um did note that this is just asking for litigation\nSo um even if the world comes into being which you've outlined is kind of a long shot of because of litigation what tools does the Trump Administration has administration how to enforce that\nSo they don't have much at all not really anything in there they say that they're going to put together a list of companies that don't meet the standards and shame um and then they're going to expect the other companies to sue each other or consumers to sue the company so\nNo ... is more political than substantive I'm Sarah Jane Tribble

man Booker Prize for fiction those off for the award include Canadian se a new job whose novel is Washington Black\nYou know when you're starting a novel you really playing with character and and you're letting them interact and you're seeing what comes of it and at least for me as a writer I really have no idea where my story is going at the outset of it\nThat's her novel starts it seems the narrator is not going anywhere if the Eighteen thirties\nBut he is a boy and slave on the British control violent but Barbados he seems likely to be worked to death and sugar cane fields van Washington Black has made an assistant a visiting white male who becomes is from going away\nAny true friendship between them\nIs impossible because of a power imbalance in the relationship it's it's just too great\nYou have to white Englishman teaches Washington Black to read and draw he's revealed to be an almost super naturally talented artist soaking up knowledge that he was denied as a slave the novelist says she didn't plan for the store to turn out that way\nPart of what I was wanting to explore\nWith this idea of I guess lack genius as being something that obviously would have existed back then than you would have people with great gifts [laughter] but that this is something that would have been snuffed out a very brutally in without much thought [laughter]\nA friend of mine said that you know we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies [laughter] but you know we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of of ah [noise] of potential of blacks greatness of black genius\nI have to ask because I'm hearing you saying that you start the novel um don't exactly know where it's going I don't think it's giving away too much to note that\nThis young inflated man and his older white companion are gonna skate Barbados they're going to get out of their uh did you need to get out of there get out of a slave situation as a novelist for your own sanity\n[noise] wasn't so much that is that I felt that with this novel what it really wanted to explore was his life posts slavery and to show\nHow [noise]\nYou know by being physically see we think of that as being kind of the end of slavery well she's not in chains he's got the way he physically free [laughter] but I really think that you know there has to be a huge psychological ramifications to having been a slave\nEven while you were free in body that obviously you're carrying with you a great trauma and probably a great sense of the will to him into your place in the world and I really wanted to express that\nI'm thinking of two ways of comes across one of the young man is constantly thinking he was going to be recaptured or church tone a another one there's a there's an observation late in the book when it becomes apparent the\nWay he resents being freed you resents the white men are free to ah obviously if you gave him so many opportunities but also took away from everything that he knew and dislocated I'm In a way\nYeah but I also think I think the main thing that he resents is the feeling that the men who freed him does not\nRespect him as an equal and this is really the crux of what what starts to eat at him is that this man made this great gesture of of helping him be free\nAnd yet he really has\nThe sense that this man thought of himself as an abolitionist and and your great crusader for good in the world that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of of Washington [noise]\nWhy does this feel like a irrelevant story to you in two thousand I think [noise]\nThink we're still dealing with the obviously a lot of the themes and concerned that come up in the book [laughter] things like racial injustice racial inequality the idea that some lives are are more worthy than other lines but also this idea of um\nPeople kind of being galvanized to do something in the world if you think of the abolitionists and um and how they [noise] they really had to [noise] not only is sort of changed\nTheir own thinking about slavery which would have been just a very quick ... an everyday thing I mean the sugar arrived on your table\nIn the mornings you put it in your oatmeal you understood that this was the product of slave labor but it was going on in a part of the world that you would probably never and you're like see a you know done by people who you really had nothing in common with\nSo to be able to change their own thinking about that and then to galvanize a whole\nSociety to to change public thinking that this is something huge and an amazing\nSo I was interviewing American voters or the other day in the state of Kentucky and there were a couple of folks and heavily wide areas who brought up black people or a couple of times um\nExpressed baffled by the centrally so I don't understand what it is the black people are complaining about I don't see prejudice in my own life\nAnd they're they're saying I don't I just don't get it I don't get this black lives matter thing ... what would you say to somebody who here's a little bit of this history that you're laying out and find it to be old news\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] that's very disheartening to say that but of course I Know I Know that this exists [laughter]\nTo me that's it's quite shocking because I mean how can one watch say videos\nSays I'm a police officers gunning down unarmed citizens have anybody watch the videos and still contend that there is not a problem and and some that we have racial equality and in fairness is baffling to me [noise]\nUh feel that there's been regression that there's been steps backwards in terms of\nPeople wanting to understand each other's experience and being open to it and I think one of the things that novel can do is to bring a reader into the characters experience [laughter]\nEspecially a character who was nothing like them you know we're dealing here with a boy and Eighteen thirties Barbados a who's a sleigh but if you can read that and start to see maybe how you are like him a similarities ah and and also\nTo feel for him as he is going through these hardship if you can do that or perhaps that can be the beginnings of some kind of empathy [noise] that'd be\nA new job as the author of Washington Black a novel that's been short listed for the Booker Prize which we find out about today Thanks so much
