has to decide whether to protect occupants or bystanders in some crashes and artificial intelligence could discriminated against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nWell the powerful trait in tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers has just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts and is\nTransparent about the assumptions built in John Havens is executive director of the ... artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for coming in\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a putting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nWasn't in general is sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is it would be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand you're trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks\nThey have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing ... would the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you have before when you have these new types of technologies and then actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to actually define them and be aware of them\nAll ethics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek\nBackground of ethics whereas when we have the other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety or trust can really be elevated\nTo more global levels and that's

the flow of people from Central America\nThey have been labeled a caravan we're talking about up words the seven thousand people many of them fleeing violence in Honduras they're moving northward and many hope to reach the United states now Mexican authorities spoke of stopping them but then let them pass into southern Mexico over the weekend President Trump delivered a stern message\nThese are hardening detainee she tells people and I don't want them to\nKnow as you say the president made these claims about these migrants without offering any evidence and we want to turn now to reporter James Frederick who was on the ground and has been following them either James\nHow to do so where exactly are you and and talk to me about the conditions of of the people in this caravan\nSo I Am in Tampa to Mexico right now it's about twenty miles north of Mexico Guatemala border I'm and I'm hearing the central square where the care of and ah ended yesterday um people here are just sleeping on the street um I mean right now I'm looking I'm\nYou know at a little girl who is tucked under a blanket with her mom right next to them is a little boys is probably three or four years old or with his parents there's a there's a guy just sleeping under a little plastic bag here\nUm these people walk more than twenty miles yesterday to get here temperatures got above Ninety degrees um so you can just tell they're absolutely exhausted\nYeah I can imagine um so I mean in addition to sleeping on sidewalks and walking is long distances and exhaustion or I mean it's\nI guess a lot of uncertainty about whether the Mexican government whether the U.S government is actually going to let them continue this journey\n[noise] yeah and it's been very confusing to try to figure out exactly what the Mexican Government strategy is here um because\nYesterday I was walking with the care of and then we heard there was a blockade being set up by Mexican police so we went to check it out they had like two hundred riot police ready to stop the caravan\nAnd then a couple of minutes later they just took this blockade away all the police left and the caravan kept marching so they don't know what's the Mexican government is really going to put police there to try to stop them or if they're going to be able to continue north it's it's just not clear yet so we've\nBeen obviously reporting on migrants from Central America making their way to the United states for a long time now that this group and correct me if I'm wrong seems particularly large um does that tell us anything\n[noise] so ... you're right we we have been seeing for years people fleeing countries like Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala there's you know lots and lots of crime gang crime is very bad there you know poverty is also really bad um\nYou know talking to people about why they're in this caravan of why so many of them have come together\nThey just said they saw the caravan as an opportunity to be safer because this migrant route is so dangerous for migrants and especially if you're traveling with kids travelling alone put you at risk of so many things of cartels and gangs attacking you which is very common here in Mexico\nSo they saw this as the safest way to get out of their countries and they think the United states is is the safest and best place they can be\nOkay then of course president from now saying though that they're not going to be allowed into the country it's a lot of uncertainty for the group you're following this reporter James Frederick speaking to us about this caravan of migrants moving northward you speaking to us from Mexico James thanks a lot\nThank you\nAmerican voters are choosing more than the U.S Congress this fall they also choose state legislatures and many governors

his policies\nKris Kobach is making it very clear where he will take us as a state he will take us back to the devastation that we had just lived through\nKelly is getting help from some unexpected sources some big name Republicans at least picked occasions or jumping party lines to support\nLaura Kelly is the only Democrat I have ever in the office of moderate\nRepublicans don't raise was

U. T. dot org\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep years ago\nThe writer ... object brand new I work in a clothing store he worked in the holiday season which pigs on Black Friday and that experience and forms the short story collection he calls\nFriday black ... book makes its points by exaggerating race and class divisions and consumer culture or is it really exaggeration you spoke with no okay\nYou write in this field of of speculative fiction or dystopian fiction whatever you want to call it\nBut one thing that separates you from other authors I've read in in that genre is that you are writing seems to be explicitly political and I wonder um as a black writer do you feel that that is partially a responsibility to have a political take on things\nI don't want to like suggest to any black writer has any particular thing they have to do mean that said I myself do feel compelled to write about certain things um it's pretty much unavoidable that my work um engages subjects that are highly politicized I think that\nMost identities or where they intersect with the culture that they come out of 'em there's this there's politics involved sometimes just existing in space and proudly allow the is somehow political so I think\nUm if you write fiction and anything that's not a vacuum on some level I think it's political and so because no one writes in a vacuum and no one comes out of a vacuum you're kind of doing some of the political and if you and I think it's a great privilege to think you are not\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people the story that gives you a book it's titled friday black\nThe short story takes place in what we assume is a department store\nAnd it's a it's a Black Friday the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism your protagonist as a young man working in the stores selling fleece jackets\nYou have these just vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they when they trample each other to the point of death they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because I think it's healthy but also I think for me to wait to help me say exactly what I wanted to say because if I don't add some Lebanese um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar it's helping medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kinda get to a story but it's like sort of the state of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually wasn't a joke after all but with on that story friday but I did work in retail I really have seen a like a woman step one another woman's like cash for genes um\nWe all know for a fact that pretty much annually someone gets killed because people in ... to try and get TVs in my mind the first time that happened everyone the country the world's would it be like whoa whoa whoa whoa\nYou know maybe we've I'm taking this thing too far but it's\nThat's a scary thing for me to think about what's scary I think how how we can know that happens so regularly still sort of casually participate\nYet the main character in that story in friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a code that he intends to get to his mother [noise]\nAnd at one point it up a colleague it in the unmanned confront them and says you know seeing seeing the body strewn about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need a cult\nAnd you know what's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment and if you can leave that originally really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being called for the blackout a previous title and after I made that editorial change after advisor then made that moment I was finally like okay this this can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment the moment of self implication\nIn which the some because they're like you know you think you're not in this but you are and to just the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness\nBecause I'm going to get my mother a thing\nAnd the ... and again for me is important because like I said I really did worked in retail there where the contest is my story instead of giving us more money or something whoever's made the most sales would get um a north face jacket [noise] and I got it from my mom I really did well I really didn't do that and um you know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the son of of immigrants from Africa from God yes both my parents are from Donna how how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes up so much of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are they're very decided we I'm African there I mean and they would sometimes even a on a bulletin thing\nThat I have to work doing sort of just about\nEven my distinction from black Americans which they you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here and because of the way our started again includes Newark I was I I understood no block is different and all you know but because of the way like the sort of pride associated with where my parents come from and\nI didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhy is the best which I think is really hard to escape and America and you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise] a lot of them it's explicit that have like some of them they're not but in my mind they're all black\nYou know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in the literary world it's almost like if you don't say that black or white\nI definitely like sort of tried to resist that and especially because in ... often the way they're racist reveal to do some type of traumatic instance happening because of the reason I don't want that to be the case where\nI'm readers are owning seeing characters that of off color having that matter of fact in some kind of pain of trauma for them\n[noise] none of Kwame Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk today we really appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much

E. along with eight PM reports and reveal they found\nThat more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the roles for so called use it or lose it\nThat's a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states or the lemonade voters who chose not to vote in primary elections now the Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting is Brian Kemp and camp is also the Republican candidate for governor W. A. B. is Johnny Kauffman is with me another Johnny\nHey David so if this happened and twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why we're focusing on this today\nWell right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrats Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor and the country her strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say that these voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and they say they're really this is a new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction\nHas there been from voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's finally\nVoting has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to rural southwest Georgia I visited a small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino and voter turnout is really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader\nAnd he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles to voting light the purchase on here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the pod cast reveal\nIt almost give people the ... say that this is a privilege not a right and so now\nAnything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use this privilege\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a ... was actually someone that was root for not voting she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless you registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration like some states so the idea that\nThis is creating a mindset that voting is a privilege to the idea that there's voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious serious charges um\n... what is secretary Kim sang in response to to all of that well ... points out that\nHe's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy they did that this year and he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people he says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters and other secretaries of state\nBut the numbers show a big jump and people were moved a one point six million people since he took over that includes all rule so people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as as a slush and gets close right\nYeah there have been at least I I think for lawsuits filed in the last week over voting or the big one is over this policy that's disproportionately holding up the voter registration applications of people of color\nThose people can still vote but civil rights advocates are worried about confusion and people getting discouraged\nUm there's some ... a lot of absentee ballots that have been rejected in one county specifically and uh you know this is a really close race they're few undecided voters both candidates are really trying to motivate their bases and they found that criticizing the other candidate over voting seems like a way to\nDo that Johnny Kauffman from member station W.

things\nI don't want to suggest that any black writer has any particular thing they have to do that said I myself do feel compelled to write about certain things um it's pretty much unavoidable that my work um engages subjects that are highly politicized I think that\nMost identities or where they intersect with the culture that they come out of 'em there's this there's politics involved sometimes just existing in space and proudly loudly is somehow political so I think\nUm if you write fiction and anything that's not a vacuum on some level I think it's political and so because no one who writes in a vacuum and no one comes out of a vacuum you're kind of doing some of the political and if you and I think it's a great privilege to think you are not\nMany of your stories are are filled with brutality but there is also a wide vein of dark humor running through some of them which I think might surprise people this story that gives you a book it's title friday black\nThis short story takes place in what we assume as a department store\nAnd it's a it's a Black Friday the Friday after Thanksgiving which we all know is is kind of a nightmare of consumerism your protagonist as a young man working in the stores selling fleece jackets\nYou have these just vicious scenes where people consumers shoppers storm\nThe entrance of the store and there are so overwhelmed at the idea of getting a deal that they trample each other they when they trample each other to the point of death they they show bodies out of the way that is a heck of a way to look at at Black Friday what were you saying there\nTo talk about the humor in it for me it's important to\nTry to laugh when you can because\nI think it's healthy but also I think for me to wait to help me say exactly what I wanted to say because if I don't add some Lebanese um humor I probably won't get through on some level for the reader I think it's like the sugar atop the medicine go down sometimes\nUm you kinda get to a story where there's like ... the vein of humor and sometimes I think the punch line is it actually wasn't a joke after all but with them that story brought a block I did work\nIn retail I really have seen a like a woman step on another woman's like cash for\nGenes um we all know for a fact that pretty much a newly someone gets killed because people in Wal Mart or trying to get TVs in my mind the first time that happened everyone the\nCountry the world's would it be like whoa whoa whoa whoa you know maybe\nWe've I'm taking this thing too far but it's that's a scary thing for me to think about what's scary I think how how you can know that happens so regularly still sort of casually participate\nYet the main character in that story in friday black as a young man who wants to get the sales record because he will win a prize and the prize is a code that he intends to give to his mother\nAnd at one point it up a colleague it in the unmanned confront them and says you know seeing seeing the bodies stern about hearing the yelling and screaming he says this this is just not worth it your mother knows that you love her she doesn't need a cult\nAnd you know what's what's funny about that moment and I didn't have that moment and if you believe that originally and I really like the original draft and I'm surprised I\nYeah and actually I'm prior to the book being caught fire back into the previous title and after I made that editorial change after advisor then made that moment I was finally like okay this this can be the title of the book because you absolutely need that moment the moment of self implication\nIn which the someone 'cause they're like you know you think you're not in this but you are in it to just the same line of logic I'm going to participate in this craziness because I'm going to get my mother a thing and the ... and again for me is important because like I said I really did worked in retail\nThere was a contest and my story through and giving us more money or something whoever's made the most sales we give them the north face jacket\nAnd I got it from my mom I really did well I really did do that and um you know I don't know that she wears it any more\nYou are the the sign of of immigrants from Africa from God yes former parents are from Donna how how do you think that informs the way you see race in the United states and in particular racial tension which makes up so much of of your book in in the United states\nI'm sure it informs me and a lot of ways I Can't even really perceive you know my parents are they're very decidedly um Africa and they got me in and they would sometimes even ... out of built in thing\nThat I had to work doing sort of just about even my distinction from black Americans which they were like you know you're not from here and I don't think you can act like these people here and because of the way our started again in Queens New York I was I I understood\nYou know block is different and all you know but because of the way like the sort of pride associated with where my parents come from and\nI didn't have to default to a feeling of\nWhy is the best which I think is really hard to escape and America and you mentioned something before like some of my characters [noise] a lot of them it's expensive to live like some of them they're not but in my mind they're all black\nYou know I don't accept the sort of white ... in in the literary world are you most like if you don't say they're black or white I definitely like sort of tried to resist that and especially because in ... often the way their races revealed his do some type of traumatic is this happening because of their race and I don't want that to be the case where\nI'm readers are only seeing characters that of our of color having that matter of fact in some kind of pain or trauma for them\n[noise] none of Kwame Ajay ... thank you so much for coming in to talk\nToday we really appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much\nIt is

E. along with eight PM reports and reveal they found\nThat more than one hundred thousand of those voters were removed from the roles for so called use it or lose it\nThat's a policy in Georgia and at least nine other state that eliminates voters who chose not to vote in primary elections now the Georgia secretary of state who oversees voting is Brian Kemp and camp is also the Republican candidate for governor WABC Johnny Kauffman is with me either Johnny\nHey David so if this happened and twenty Seventeen um why is it significant now why we're focusing\nOn this today well right now we're in the midst of a really close historic race for governor here and there's lots of national attention on it and camp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams and she would be the first black female governor and the country her strategy to win this year is all about boosting turnout amongst people of color and\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say that these voters don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans so to use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and they say they really this is a new voter suppression tactic Republicans are using to help them win and so what reaction has there been\nFrom voters I mean this is becoming a campaign issue and he's finally\nVoting has really become a central issue in the campaign here and we went to rural southwest Georgia I visited the small town called Moultrie which is mostly black and Latino voter turnout is really low there and we spoke to Reverend Cornelius ponder who's a community leader\nAnd he explains that low turnout is because of these obstacles to voting like the purchase I'm here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast reveal\nIt almost give people to read mine said that this is a ... not right and so now\nAnything that is a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nAnd so when it comes to the purchase a ... was actually someone that was root for not voting she voted for Obama in two thousand eight she hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month she may go to the polls and she won't be able to vote Georgia doesn't have same day voter registration like some states so the idea that\nThis is creating a mindset that voting is a privilege the idea that there is voter suppression I mean those are incredibly serious I'm Serious charges um\nWhat is secretary Kemp say in response to to all of that well ...\nPoints out that he's following the last year the Supreme Court has approved this use it or lose that policy they did that this year\nAnd he says you know the state sends out multiple notifications before moving these people\nHe says he hasn't been more aggressive and purging voters and other secretaries of state but the numbers show a big jump and people were moved a one point six million people since he took over that includes all rule so people who have moved our died and these people who have been removed for not voting\nAnd you've been following a lot of issues like this as as as well as she gets close right\nYeah there have been at least I I think for lawsuits filed in the last week over voting or the big one is over this policy that's disproportionately holding up the voter registration applications of people of color\nThose people can still vote but civil rights advocates are worried about confusion and people getting discouraged\nUm there's some ... a lot of absentee ballots that have been rejected in one county specifically and uh you know this is a really close race there are few undecided voters both candidates are really trying to motivate their bases and they found that criticizing the other candidate over voting seems like a way to do that\n[noise] Johnny Kauffman from member station W.
