[noise] they'll go down hole was one of many people\nMaking money off the oil industry here is that a wife and three kids and not a lot of tolerance for\nYou'll hear people say that the oil industry is like a drug and it really can be because if people are fearful they get so dependent on it when it's gone they don't know what and I didn't want them to be us\nSo we started a business that rents out construction equipment like port a potties to all sorts of corporations including oil companies and when it comes to politics not Elliott doesn't give President Trump all the credit for this bill but he does like what he's been seeing\nAmerica First taking pride in what we do um [noise] you know letting people know that [noise]\nYou know we're not in you know we're not we're not going to be somebody's little hand out all the time and that you know we want to grow\nOur economy here and as for pick us specifically as long as we keep moving forward that the biggest hasn't just been moving forward it has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speed with no roads [noise]\nIt's really an emergency situation we weren't prepared\nFor this this is the mayor pick us her name as vendetta seals and she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here in this place can handle\nWhat's the population that's a hard one to answer [laughter] according to the ... population were just under ten thousand we are easily on any given day somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand depending on how many people are driving in and that's putting a huge strain on this small towns infrastructure\nThere aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores unless you've actually been here you don't understand what the need is here you don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store and then when you go\nThe shells the route of bread milk you know all the staples my husband's retired he knows when ... guys you know [laughter] and the bread guys shows up literally that's when he goes to get get those things for us that's crazy that is crazy we would probably have exploded even more\nIf we had the housing in place because right now so many of these workers that are living in the arby's travel trailers the workforce lodging they'll live there but most time their family certainly lived there for an indefinite length of time this is oil field you don't want to bring\nYour family here anyways the man cameras like\nYet um she said man camps that is literally what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kelly do is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's reading rainbow tied I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real\nThey work these crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home\nYou know smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so it's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come to a maid bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite shifts they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table onto a closet like\nWhat two years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and Pecos took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in the sex and money\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here and take us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class families who have\nBeen here for generations that mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize that there are people who are being left behind all the Oliver is is the county attorney she is a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing here we are way and [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door\nHow are you there [noise]\nI'm trying to get their vote out for vets O'Rourke video okay thanks bye-bye\nBeto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that old work would have an uphill battle\nPeople I knew um who had been Democrat three years having now just [noise]\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nBetter because even if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes maybe they'll finally get that grocery store there's also talk of the new hospital maybe the city will have enough money to fix up the rundown cemetery in the middle of town [noise]\nSo what happened to the blue wave I mean the reason that our work has gotten so much that's when we get attention is because he's come further than any other democratic candidate in recent history a but you're not feeling it I'm not feeling it here [noise]\nWere filling up our dancing you pause at the gas station on the main drag a

from NPR News I'm Noel King in Washington DC\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we have been on a road trip through the tax us twenty third congressional district ... district which is actually a rare swing district in this very red state\nIt covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nAnd we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the valley that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river ... means friendships in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll real case it's the city of Cuba Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAnd mental lives with her longtime partner Ralph law also grew up\nHere like I think it would be like some tea okay everybody would be in a hot humid or Haile Selassie is that we could also demand across into a ... a couple of times a week what takes it if\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and my groceries over their Amanda has\nSympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S [noise] but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nTo fight you can get it because I get on my teeth you know medicine is\nDo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\n... ... ... when they say separate what varies a while to get out of anybody backing you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nThe rooms rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weather skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot in these harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for the [noise] we've had those instances where you know people have died out there\nWhen the less which most of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico\nThat's linked up before anybody starts talking about the border wall\nThe new season this natural state\nPeople will have more like who is a war zone on her and it's actually not to me before we started throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence\nInstead there are these houses along the river bank he pulls up on a vacant lot between two homes he knows the owner he tells us it's no problem\nThere perks sheriff\nThat'll do further much at all\nJust across this little yes if even a river this looks like a lake of increased the ... how many feet\nAre we talking well we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigners ... [noise]\nI mean that's a hard to swim across\nSo a ninth someone can just swim across just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here and like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district in heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support people like Jeff Martinez\nWill it come to an air of giving them the same tour [noise] All right well here's you felt that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because you're Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though he didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration [noise] the sure have been invited to the table previous administrations\nWe weren't or we were older but it'll lead in the bones were blown\nUp by the to solve the immigration issue the sure of the reasons why we can't just go to go\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that Wal\nMart deal was to you can control with technology cameras a sort of put it in the physical structure is where you're going to put\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nElection day is November six but the

Bradford reports\nThe plan calls for Medicare starting in twenty twenty to seek the much lower prices the European countries get for some of the most expensive drugs dispensed by doctors yeah this is a really creative proposal Dan Mendelson of health care consulting firm apple leader basically\nWhat they would do is create a benchmark of prices based on\nWhat drug companies are charging internationally empowering Medicare to get those lower prices this is something Republicans have resisted in the past but Northwestern University health care economists Craig Garth weight calls it the same Trump in world view behind recent tariffs\nThe world is that other people are taking advantage of the United states and we're going to be strong and we're going to fix that\nAnd so we're going to force Europe to pay more by having the United states pay less\nHe says European prices would go up a little with drug companies knowing there simultaneously setting us prices now there's a lot of unknowns here how it would work if it would work who would affect those answers won't come until a draft proposal next summer well after the November election I bet Bradford for marketplace\nStock

showing how technological bright ideas boost the economy or fix the environment\nThat used to seem crazy to many other economists who tend to focus more on concrete things which is which is coming out of factories not seemingly mushy things like ideas\nDr Paul Romer chews on all sorts of interesting matters such as the difference between blind optimism I things will be fine you'll magically have enough money for retirement versus what is called conditional optimism retirement will be fine if we have a savings plant\nRobbers and economists to New York university's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics ... welcome to the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day has been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses\nBe patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nDo you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs\nThe complacent attitude would have been to say ah it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was this sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century\nThere was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education to be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming\nSo if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything can turn out better for everybody but if you just are complacent say out it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we continue to follow here is what technology will do for but also due to the labor force\nWith artificial intelligence automation robots we're entering you know everyone says a highly disruptive period but I Do talk to people who said don't worry about it as a matter of policy it's worked itself out in the past does your notion of conditional optimism\nHelp us with what tech will do to the workforce this time around\nAbsolutely and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know twenty century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nThere are new things we need to do in the labor market in education and in thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turn out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of it pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself should be out there actually lobbying for the policies that they believe in\nOne of the most powerful insights an economics is this idea of a division of labor do the thing you're good at other people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or uh any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you ... you are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go to a doctor at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking spot did NYU give you anything [laughter]\nWell let's just say we're in negotiations

T.\nDad or\nOne of the target of the bombs Jordans or why is he made so many political enemies and working in Washington DC [noise] and I'm Rachel Martin reporting\nComing up we'll hear from another house race in North Carolina where demographic Arkansas meetings like titan rain in a traditionally Republican districts it's harvest season in the mid west will take\nYeah Iowa praying more in a wet growing season have met Mahler profit\nCountry artist Keith Urban from\nThe news is next\nThese are individuals who may have spent lots of time over the place like Afghanistan and Iraq\nDealing with it provides explosive devices on a daily basis so massive learning curve in conflict zones\nSo that's about the most intensive on the job training you can get in a place like Iraq or Afghanistan and as these guys come back um they're they're going to places like the FBI the ATF and local bomb squads\nOh so they're all benefiting from the experience NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre and Greg thanks so much thank you oh\n[laughter]\nAnd now we turn to the mid term elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas' twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state's only real truth ... swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no algal morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico a this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual en masse it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around those cities are really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nWe driven the hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we've passed hunter circle entrance gate hunters do\nEvery street starts with hunters yes it's kind of silly right it just makes it that much more confusing because\nThis is Janet uncle store she and her husband made a good living and real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby\nAnd so that makes it more cardio okay little sweaty or have you taken a lot and\nWe met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac get it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole everyone sort of keeps to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we had it out for a walk was on straight yeah actually it's been this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get back together I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nBecause I put in more hours and then people can be about as much and you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even less campaign staffers stay in our house so is it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know I've always been aware politically but I've also been complacent I mean look around wearing this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about my history I Wish I'd done more earlier\nFor progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the ... are painted to look like pumpkin for Halloween so if you like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do it okay there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race\nAgainst Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door it all started when one guy said someone had stolen his head crew sign then he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record\nTo electric cute the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the thread\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kicked good for you it just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've\nHeard and seen that one ever he says it's fine whoever he hurts assign\nJanet's neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally\nAnd Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nWas great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be in more everyone likes the direction that the country's\nLiving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration the\nObvious uh onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries they're coming from and coming through two sons the flow a\nIt's very concerning and uh there's just no accounting for all these people\nFlowing in I told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet Ogle for in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Allen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded I'd walk\nWalked with a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and uh because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't you know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um [noise] I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you change\nAh [noise] I I think I'm Out there every day you know I'm trying to uh be to be the opposite\nOf a cold and and have open arms to people and\nUh I I you know I Hope that I can lead by example and I think I Do uh we might have\nPolitical differences that we all or you know working towards the same bowl\nBut in a while that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she she totally feels that divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nAnd these voters are going to be making decisions into really big races how are they talking about the Senate contest between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz and about the congressional race\nRight so we should say the congressional race a pitch the incumbent Republican will heard against the Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones and according to a recent poll by the New York times will heard is up in that race by Fifteen points so that's a really big spread you know he's got an advantage not only is he the incumbent but he's\nReally positioned himself as as a moderate in in a swing district which he has to do\nA and and that is working to his advantage over work and cruise much closer a cruise is up by seven points that our work is making a play\nOr we'll see if all the mild he's put on his car all the face time he's putting with voters will make a difference um but it would be it would be to tonic

T. business circle members are getting their names mentioned threw out the fall membership drive which wraps up tonight and for an entire week after will be highlighting them through next friday so still plenty of time to get the name of your business\nAnd I'm Noel King we're going to take a look now at a disturbing and confounding case of sexual assaults within a hundred and\nIf the women and girls came forward in court this year and said they were sexually abused by one man and that abuse went on for decades\nLarry Nassar was the top doctor for the U.S women's Olympic gymnastics team he also worked from Michigan State university this past January Nassar was sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison today we're going to look at really what is the central mystery of the case how did last or get away with it for so long\nTo reporters Michigan Radio have been digging into this question and a new podcast that's called believed I talked to the host Kate Wells I'm Lindsey Smith and before we start we should warn listeners this conversation includes some graphic language describing sexual assault\n... both high while for having us I Know that um when you guys set out one of your goals was to dig more deeply into the failures that allowed ... to abuse women and girls for as long as he did what did you find this is Kate\nSo one of the things that we found is that guys like Larry Nassar are are really good at winning your trust and you can hear some of that actually happening in a police tape\nHere was tape during two different police interview there two years apart for both two different complaints by the Michigan State university police\nAnd in the first one that you can hear him talking to this detective about this complaint that's coming against him\nAs having gone as far as the same time like this really feels I was doing something and and ... which\nWhich is you know ... and that you feel bad and she feels\nThat way because I feel like this little June or really that far right and that's why the wrong job for a while if I recall every one of these some of your\nI mean this is fascinating he is being interrogated by a police officer who's telling him it's good to hear that you feel bad what does that tell you\nWell I mean what really the shows you how good Larry Nassar is at manipulating other people and and\nHow overwhelming on an individual level that can feel you know what is more likely in this situation that one young woman as far as this detective is aware has miss understood a valid medical technique\nOr you know this Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and I teach this I lecture on this\nAny sort of doubt you might have had about his techniques and his legitimacy he's really doing everything they can build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put him back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape and ... tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen or another accuser has come forward that same her name is Rachel ... and she also comes forward publicly in a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police detective ... bird\nAnd she definitely takes a different approach\nOr she is working ... name of his own\nGoals you know that wasn't going to have you ever do that sort of characters or would you mind if I if I'm losing good if I'm not sure he was pushing off her look I um\nWas so what you're describing is very different than how she describes herself as\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest were the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an front comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records\nAnd so ... believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on\nNassau it's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused is very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple questions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nIf there was a arousal it's is is very much because of for\nHer poem ... whatever ... well [noise] I don't know where you're from Virginia and Russia have you on this show when you're ... you're you're you're you're saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed this detective Andrea ... heard one of the things she talks about looking back at this interview is that she herself\nWas kind of unsure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple question like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his and he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys in you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start by believing the victim worth the very least hearing the victim out yeah well I mean fundamentally\n... this is how guys like this operate as they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just this great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans were not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family but the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum\nIt it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so much

[noise] they'll go down home as well as\nMany people making money off the oil industry here is that a wife and three kids and not a lot of tolerance for [noise]\nYou'll hear people say that the oil industry\nIs like a drug and it really can be because people are fearful they get so dependent on it when it's gone they don't know what and I didn't want them to be\nSo we started a business that rents out construction equipment like port a potties to all sorts of corporations including oil companies and when it comes to politics but Eliot doesn't give President Trump all the credit for this bill but he does like what he's been seeing\nAmerica First taking pride in what we do a you know letting people know that [noise]\nYou know we're not we're not we're not going to be somebody's little hand out all the time and [noise] you know we want to grow our economy\nHere and ask for pick a specific like as long as they keep moving forward that some of the biggest hasn't just been moving forward it has been barreling down the highway at breakneck speed with no roads [noise]\nIt's really an emergency situation we weren't prepared\nFor this this is the mayor ... name has been ... seals and she says her city needs to see more of that money because now there are way more people here in this place can handle\nWhat's the population of that's a hard one to answer [laughter] according to the twenty teen population were just under ten thousand we are easily on any given day somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand depending on how many people are driving it\nAnd that's putting a huge strain on this small towns infrastructure there aren't enough things like restaurants or even grocery stores\nUnless you've actually been here you don't understand what the need is here you don't understand what it's like to stand in these lines at the grocery store and then when you go\nThe shows the route of bread milk you know all the staples\nMy husband's retired he knows when milk guys you know [laughter] and the bread guy shows up literally ... when he goes to get those things for us that's crazy that is crazy we would probably have exploded even more\nIf we had the housing in place because right now so many of these workers that are living in the arby's travel trailers the workforce lodging they'll live there but most time their families aren't than lived there for an indefinite length of time this is oil field you don't want to\nBring your family here anyway as the man cameras like\nYet um she said man camps that is literally what people here call the temporary housing sites that have popped up in the last few years to accommodate all of these oil workers Kelly Duke is the twenty four year old manager of this man camp she's wearing a rainbow tied I T shirt with a unicorn on it it says keeping it real they work\nThese crazy hours so we just have to get in there and make it like home like home cooked meals smile on your face you know agreed on like kind of that thing so it's not like it's their princesses but uh it's nice to come home to remain bed\nKaylee points out the double wide trailers as we walk around each of them can sleep up to ten men sometimes they get their own room sometimes if they work opposite shifts they share\nWe got our two full size beds and we have a night table into a closet like\nWhat two years ago Kelly was doing the same work in North Dakota and when the oil and pick us took off so did she\nIt's good money and let's say you're not going to college at the moment I mean this is the place to be if you're out in the tax money\nSo that's a snapshot of the situation here and take us fracking has opened up the basins and there's money to be made by anyone who can find a foothold into oil or any of the related businesses\nNot everyone is seeing a direct benefit though property taxes have gone up here the problem is it's not just the oil companies that pay that hike it's working class\nFamilies who have been here for generations\nThe mentality is take it while you can but they don't recognize it there are people who are being left behind all the all the rest is the county attorney she's a lifelong Democrat as are most people here but the oil boom seems to be changing here we are rare [noise]\nAll the has been going door to door\nHow are you there [noise]\nI'm trying to get them bowed out\nFor vets or are you okay thanks bye-bye Beto O'Rourke has given Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz a run for his money and all the never expected that ... work would have an uphill battle here\nPeople I knew um who had\nBeen Democrats for years has now just [noise]\nDecided that I guess the Republican ways better\nEven if they themselves are making money hand over fist people around them are and that has to be good in the long run so the thinking goes\nAs well have a better idea\nWhat happened at too early to Iran when you're not know any of the ...\n... has limited safety railing and none of the cliff said this is NPR News from Washington\nAnd with the news in Austin and Joseph like good morning polls are open until seven tonight for the fifth day of early voting in Texas the head of the November sixth elections turnout in Travis County so far has been about three times higher than voter participation in the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nThe Texas secretary of state reports some more early voting surgeon most other large counties across the state\nAnyone planning to vote straight ticket today should double check their ballot before cast in it that's what a nonprofit legal

read about it in the cats my balance something told me to the ground over to the screen and when I looked over spring I saw the crew was noted up my senator\nThese same machines are used in Travis County by county clerk Dana doubles wise says she hasn't heard reports of that happening here but he said it's possible for voters to change their votes accidentally if they touch buttons before

C.\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas we've been on a road trip through the tax us twenty third congressional district district which is actually a rare swing district in his very red state\nIt covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nAnd we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at the very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river ... means friendship in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll reuse case it's the city of a junior Mexico\nWe're a family and this border\nThis is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't look down to them and they're equal because I grew up with him but you still don't want them to come here I Want to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph law also grew\nUp there and they're going to be like some tea yeah okay I really would be in a hot too humid because it's so hot here I mean you're also demand across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week what takes it if\nI have friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there and my groceries over there and\nThen to have sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail where she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nI keep coming in because I get on my teeth you know my medicine is\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think it makes me very angry\nWhat do you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico now\nIt and when they say separate ... there is a while I don't think anybody back in the winter you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not a wall there's a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nIt's a rural rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and voice that says he's seen an awful lot and he's harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for the [noise] we've had those instances where you know people have died out there when the last six months of that we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC on a tour of the border just like he's\nDoing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico I've learned\nThat before anybody starts talking\nAbout the border wall\nThe new to see it in this natural state\nPeople of North Dakota is a war zone out here and it's actually not to me before we start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years and he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence\nInstead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know the owner he tells us it's no problem\nThere perks sheriff\nLittle bit of a there's much at all\nAcross this little if even a river this looks like a lake\nBecause the ... how many feet\nAre we talking about our problem talking what three hundred feet foreigners ... [noise]\nI mean that's a hard to fill across\nSo ... someone can just ...\nJust walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm I asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here\nAnd like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border the people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities\nAnd even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support that people like chef Martinez\nWill ever come to an air of giving them this same\nTour [noise] All right well here's your self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration [noise] the sure have been invited to the table [noise] previous administrations\nWe weren't or we were\nOver there everybody else was even the bones were blown\nThat up to the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table you can't you can't just go to ...\nBecause he knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to you can control where technology cameras a sort of put it in the physical structure because where you're going to put\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nHow did you walk away from this entire process\nI think we are due for a major crisis in American Life I think we're going to be faced with a pivotal choice in the national life of whether we are going to continue\nTo aspire and try to be a genuine democracy where the principle of equality becomes more and more the live reality\nOf the country or it will become this kind of or sat democracy where we have the trappings of elections but I'm real the real power resides elsewhere\nWere pretty much there right now um I think the ... talk or see the oceans of dark money they can pour into elections I'm really tips the scale not completely but\nI think any popular candidate has an uphill battle when I Do think about hopefulness or lack of a take comfort in the fact that America is very is\nIt is never all one thing or all the other it is too many different things I think it leads to this point for one person or one movement to\nHer you know the American nation into a single lane and so I think just sheer diversity and energy\nAnd vitality that new immigrants bring new cultures bring in that re thinking what is the American culture what is the American care to what is it what is the American identity I think as long as there is a vital core to that exploration and they there's a good deal has to be had for the country\nAnd fountain is the author of beautiful country burning can bend thank you so much for your time and you're thinking oh man thank you Jennifer was a pleasure\nCan hear more of our conversation and keep up with the latest news that K.

U. T. dot org or five one to four seven one six to nine one and we thank you very much\nAbout it is warm breezes and memory is an amazing thing is it harder Reeves aren't normally or I'm going to go with your ... and you don't have any idea why are\nThe goddess of what we are cautiously figure out what we're consuming food court brains are responding in ways that we're not even imagining above do I'm Mark\nI'm Rebecca neck and right and this is two guys on your head [noise] today chicken and the brain\nFascinating article came out about the attractiveness to human beings of fat\nAnd sugar in foods and I'll take both ... and so most of us do rights but what's interesting we we know that over the past years right there's been this attempt to replace fasten foods are having low fat no fat and of course the way they compensate for that replaces the fat sugar\nAnd with this study by ... and his colleagues elegant we've demonstrated that if you take actually they were using milk shakes in this particular experiment all the ... were mash in terms of the total core concept and yet they replaced the sugar with fat in different amounts and looks the way people responded to these ... in terms of their responses in their brain and\nIncredible doping release when they were drinking sugared milkshakes right not so much with fat wallet dispatchers didn't matter some blood sugar drove the response\nWhich is fascinating for a couple of reasons right the first of course is just if what you're trying to do is to get people to eat in a more healthy way and you think well we got to cut down on fat because\nThat is going to be associated with cholesterol court sorts of other things and then what you do that is to replace it with sugar which is something that's driving people to want to take in more calories\nThan inadvertently you're putting people in a in a psychological situation in which they're going to want to ingest more calories than they can burn off and doing it in a way in this particular study that illustrates the fact that regardless of what we're consciously thinking about what we're consuming foods\nOr brains are responding in ways that we're not even imagining it's happening right I mean I I don't I don't think most of us would imagine that it other than the actual conscious responses we have to food if this is delicious or I Want more of that or I don't or whatever that in fact\nDifferent neurotransmitters are being released in response to different foods in ways that we are not entirely vocal about an all aware\nOf science and what's fascinating is you know when the brain is responding\nWhat it's really trying to do the brain isn't really trying to give you a pleasurable response with the brain is trying to do is to figure out what it is it's supposed to learn in that situation exactly and so when your brain releases all of this doping mean a lot of what it's doing is telling it remember this and do this again when the situation comes up\nAnd so when you get that huge response from that milk shake what it really does is to put you in a situation where you start craving milkshakes when you\nDo you milk shake you really want to drink a part of what's happening is in this drive to make the food healthier they replaced the fact with sugar you put people in a situation in which the brain than learns eat more of that sugary stuff right and and that's why it backfires and then people don't know why they think I'm but I'm eating fat free food\nWriter and of course all of this has an evolutionary history because of the scarcity\nOf good sources of sugar\nAnd for for a long period of time and and now of course the sugar is found in abundance I mean we can get sugar very easily in contemporary society at least in industrialized world and so now\nIt's understandable that those vestiges of our evolutionary past which taught us to go get more sugar because it's rare that you're going to encounter such an opportunity or now functioning toward detriment\nRight and this is just an example of why it is that it can be very difficult to control our behavior in a modern environment that is so radically different from the environment in which the brain\nDeveloped in the first place and food is one of the places where you really see that because a food because of of modern agricultural practices food has become fairly cheap and fairly plentiful so that if it were ... we don't have the kinds of scarcity\nIn this culture you know it's not that there are places in the world where this half of course but but in this culture we don't have that kind of scarcity and our brains then lead us to do things that seemed like a good idea a hundred and fifty thousand years ago\nAnd uh aren't such a good idea anymore right let's\nTalk a little bit of ... um sweeteners artificial sweeteners do they have any effect on the brain and the way that our brains well Steve sugars\nThat's one way to create a trick right because what our\nBrains are doing is responding to our taste receptors to what it is that we're eating so if you create a taste that simulates a taste of a natural thing like sugar and you create aspartame or whatever other kinds of things people do that create that sense of sweetness I suppose the brain will respond\nIf it's wise to the taste receptors that we're just not going to have the same sex perhaps on other systems in the body because the other systems recognize that this was in fact not sugar wasn't\nThat actually does this actually causes a problem because part of what happens is again remember the what the brain is trying to to do is to predict the future and then react to the future so it's not just the case that this artificial sweetener gives me this sensation of a delicious sweet taste it actually is an alert to the body\nThat there's about to be a significant violation of homeostasis or there's a big word what does this mean your body wants to stay within sort of a particular set of parameters\nAnd if I throw a bunch of sugar at it I actually run the risk of doing harm to my body that's why a diabetic it has to monitor their blood sugar because because having too much sugar in the blood can actually be a problem\nSo if I get an alert from the from my brain telling me I'm about to get a big influx of sugar\nThan the brain sends a message down to my pancreas and get busy and producing insulin and so you actually\nDrop your blood sugar in preparation for all the sugar that's about to come in through the stomach so you've got this red alert going are are you know\nAnd and and now you you you're the Packers were uh uh releases the insulin the\nYour blood sugar level drops and then and then your body should they are going what\nWas my [laughter] and\nSo now so now your body is confused because it's got to drive your blood sugar backups and now it says you better you something [laughter] because I've I've got a ... a drop in blood sugar so it's it's actually not such a good idea to trick your brain\nNude next week we'll discuss odd facts about data and the brain with Dr ... and Dr ... David ... Perlman and Michael Crawford our our engineers I'm Rebecca Nineteen right and I predicted as on your head\nAt Katy media in Austin, Texas bases\nK U T Ninety point five Austin's NPR station eight o'clock on this Friday morning and Jennifer state and thanks so much for tuning in this is K.

K. U. T. dot org\n[noise] but I don't know what goes through his head when he says stuff like that there are people watching a rally like that on TV that are insane America isn't a you know a a place where every single person is fully functioning and processing information that way the president in a situation like that probably\nThinks that it's a performance art we're not talking about this specific case I've spoken with law enforcement I don't have any ah any specific information on this investigation but the bigger point is we need an overarching sense of ... the proceeds and supersede\nThe particular policy or legislative issues you might find in that sense of we include the the freedom of the press and religion it's beach oppressive assembly again protest and so that's what we're supposed to be passing on I I don't I don't know what you say to\nA rally like that when one of the fundamental duties of the president should be shepherding a sense of what the wages that doesn't mean we don't differ about lots of other things\nThere's ordinance to that and they're after you've condemned any sense of the threats of political violence in domestic terrorism\nSenator Ben Sasse Republican of Nebraska is also author of the book them why we hate each other and how to heal center thanks so much for joining us\nThanks\n\nAnd now we turn to the mid term elections leading up to next month's voting we've been bringing you stories from some of the key districts across the country Texas' twenty third district is viewed as one of the Lone Star state only real true swing districts and that's where we find our own Rachel Martin Morning Rachel\nHey no welcome morning from Del Rio Texas that's where we're broadcasting from this morning right near the U.S border with Mexico this district is huge not in terms of population necessarily but in terms of just actual land mass it goes all the way from just outside El Paso to San Antonio\nAnd the suburbs around the city is a really key in the upcoming elections Republicans and Democrats are both fighting for the votes in particular of white suburban women like the two women were going to introduce you to right now\nDo have an hunters creek neighborhood and quickly noticed a pattern we passed hunter circle interstate hunters do every street starts with yes it's kind of silly right\nIt just makes it much more confusing this is Janet uncle store she and her husband made a good living in real estate they are retired now and she teaches part time ... at the gym nearby and so that makes it more cardio okay little sweaty and have you taken ... we met her at her house in a well manicured cul de sac\nGet it says people here are friendly enough but on the whole\nEveryone sort of keep to themselves which actually suits are just fine she filled up water bottles and we had it out for a walk was on straight yeah actually for this way in many ways Janet represents a lot of white liberal women\nWhen Trump was elected and I kind of fell apart and to get\nTogether I actually did a lot of reading of you know OK Howard how to survive this and the advice was get busy\nFor her that included volunteering for a group she cared a lot about Planned Parenthood\nAnd I actually got a pink Cape my first year\nBecause I put in more hours and then people could me about it much and you don't have to wear the Cape again today\nJanet follows politics more closely than she ever did before she registers people to vote she donates to campaigns she even less campaign staffers stay in her house so it was it an overstatement to say that it has been a political awakening\nFor you know it's I've always been aware politically but I've also been complacent I mean look around we're in this relatively affluent area I got mine you know I don't really have to worry that much um and I hate that about\nMy history I Wish I'd done more earlier for progressive candidates I just didn't think it was so necessary now I Do\nWe keep walking around the island in the middle of the street where the cactus is are painted to look like pumpkins for Halloween so if you'd like we can cut right through here to my house yeah let's do it okay there are a lot of campaign signs in Janet's front yard all for Democrats including Beto O'Rourke who's running a surprisingly competitive race\nAgainst Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz\nJanet's not the only ONE Campaign signs have stirred up an Internet scene battle on the Web site next door\nIt all started when one guy said someone had stolen his Ted Cruz sign then he and others on the site talked about reading their signs with the power record to electric you the next person who tried Janet read the comments off the threat\nHere's what I wouldn't want to kill them but I Would share the video of them being shocked until the break or kick good for you it just goes on\nFor her crew supporters are in the same camp as Trump supporters and she just can't understand where they're coming from\nI think Trump spaces last I think when I hear them described as a cult that makes sense to me from what I've\nHeard and seen what ever he says it's find\nWhoever he hurts his side\nDennis neighbor Ellen Pfeifer is a big fan of Donald Trump Hi Ellen thank you so much for doing this absolutely I'm excited we were supposed to talk with her the same day we saw Janet but then Trump came to Texas for a rally\nAnd Ellen had to go she and a couple of friends drove up to Houston stood in line for hours and got to see the president do his thing we spoke the next morning how was it\nIt was great it was everything that you hear on TV that it's going to be and more\nEveryone likes the direction that the country's moving she likes Trump's tax cuts the low unemployment rate she also likes the president's position on immigration\nThe obvious the onslaught of migrants coming up uh the inability of the the countries that are coming from and coming through two songs to flow a\nVery concerning and ah there's just no accounting for all these people flowing in\nI told Ellen about my conversation with her neighbor Janet ... in particular the bit were Janet said Trump's base acts like a cult Ellen says she doesn't think of herself as a radical she's voting for Ted Cruz and Republican will hurt and the congressional race but she thinks of herself as open minded I blocked walked\nWith a liver over in a very liberal neighborhood all summer and uh because I thought she was the best person for the job so I don't know I don't think I'm part of that cold\n[noise] um [noise] I guess I Would close by just asking if you could change anything about our current political moment would what would you change ah [noise]\nI I think I'm Out there every day you know I'm trying to uh be to be the opposite\nOf a cold and and have open arms to people and\nUh I I you know I Hope that I can lead by example and I think I Do uh we might have\nPolitical differences that we all or you know working towards the same goal\nBut no all that sentiment that you heard Ellen expressing there really is aspirational she totally feels that divides between parties right now so does her neighbor Janet as we heard they're each making their case to their neighbors to try to see the world as they see it\nThanks so much Rachel, Rachel Martin is joining us from Del Rio Texas today and we'll be hearing her stories elsewhere and [noise] this is MORNING EDITION\nOn K.

C.\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin and this morning we are broadcasting from Del Rio Texas which is just a few miles from the U.S border with Mexico I'm at this very moment looking over lake on his side on the Rio Grande river this is the natural divide between the U.S and Mexico\nDel Rio is part of the twenty third congressional district in Texas a really one of the only swing districts in this red state and we've been talking to voters about what's on their mind the head of the twenty Eighteen but terms and how they measure the presidency of Donald Trump\nThere's a new poll out this morning from NPR PBS NewsHour and merits that addresses that very topic and we have NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro with us to discuss the findings governing the medical Hi Rachel so I Am at this moment looking up at the vast Texas guy and it feels pretty far away from Washington DC in\nPolitics but so that's\nReally nice but let's dig into the\nPoll findings eh let's start with the president and Republicans they saw bumping enthusiasm among the base during a justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing did it last [noise]\nNot really you know the Kavanaugh factor appears to actually have faded as a big motivating issue for voters Republicans have maintained their level of enthusiasm but with the pollsters tell us is that that's more likely because it's October the closer you get to the election there is a natural rise\nA and when you look at Kavanaugh specifically the number of people saying he'd motivating their vote\nHas gone down between both parties including Republicans\nAnd we see the president's approval rating back down to thirty nine percent we see Democrats opening up a gap of ten points now on the question of whether you want to have a Democrat or Republican in control of Congress and your district\nI feel like you've been on the program several times over the past few months talking about the importance of women in these midterm elections a President Trump is struggling on that front as opposed to the he's making any inroads with female voters\nNot at all at one of our pollster said that it's really all about the gender gap here in twenty Eighteen or twenty ten and twenty four team are really about men who are motivated to take back the house and Senate upset with President Obama but in twenty Eighteen it's about women who are motivated against President Trump\nWe saw that up and down on questions related to the president's approval rating to preference for control of Congress and in particular when you look at white college educated women they give the president the lowest approval ratings of almost any group and are among the highest to believe that these elections are very important so they're very motivated\n... really interesting because we did meet a woman care Janet ... in the suburbs of San Antonio\nSame thing uh she's a liberal she's a Democrat but the election of Donald Trump a shattered her and she's become politically motivated in a in a totally new way so we've definitely seen that play out here what about issues the medical I mean it does the poll addressed what are the issues that are that are going to motivate people to turn out this year\nWell you know first and foremost a driving factor in this election as President Trump to third say that the president will be a factor in their vote that's twenty points higher than in twenty fourteen when the same question was asked about President Obama and that's the year Republicans took back the Senate but when we does it when we drove in specifically at some of the issues that are important to people\nThe top issue of course was jobs on the economy followed by health care and immigration\nAll of which we've heard a lot about in this election but when you break it down by party that's where you see some real differences Republicans jobs in the economy and immigration far and away the biggest issues nothing else comes close for Democrats health care and climate change\nA notice I didn't mention those tax cuts Republicans hope to run on those but they haven't broken through more people say they'd be motivated to vote for a Democrat because of those tax cuts\nAnd when you ask people about the rising federal deficit sixty percent including a plurality of Republicans say in order to address the deficit they'd prefer to roll back tax cuts rather low paying title means and fears of medical months now\nAnd this is K U T Ninety point five Austin's NPR station MORNING EDITION is underway to eight thirty nine on this Friday morning early voting continues here in Texas three next friday November seconds you can find more information about the voting process than what's on the ballot\nFind that at K.

Olympic doctor who's been doing this for so long and who's so many people love and he's the best at this that he abused one girl I mean it's just hard on a human level to not get sucked into this kind of manipulation\nThis is Lindsey he does this over and over I mean we've given you one example Noel but he does this in a multitude of ways of this two and a half hour long interview and he also layers and\nI teach this I lecture on this any sort of doubt you might have had about his technique than his legitimacy he's really doing everything it can to build that up this is Kate again\nHe gets cleared to go back to work after that they put them back into the clinic and we know that at least Seventy women and girls say that they were abused after that twenty fourteen case and and when he returned to treating patients\nSeventy yeah eventually another interrogation and this interrogation leads to his arrest I Know you have some tape of that ... tell me about it as well\nSo this is an interrogation from twenty sixteen uh another accuser has come forward that same her name is Rachel ... she also comes forward publicly and a a newspaper article in the Indianapolis Star\nAnd she also decides to call police about a case of abuse that had happened to her Fifteen Years prior and this call goes to a different detective at MSU police detective Andrea maneuvered\nAnd she definitely takes a different approach\nThat she is working ... name of his own\nGoals that wasn't in your review that for a concert or would you like if I wrote his I'm using the if I'm not sure he was pushing off to her look I um\nWas saying what you're describing is very different than how she just said\nWhat is the important difference in this interrogation why does this interrogation lead to an arrest were the other one did not\nI mean to put it probably to simply does that give them an front comes in believing Rachel she also has the benefit of knowing that this is the second complaint\nAnd Rachel has brought a lot of evidence with her that this abuse happened journal entries medical records\nAnd so ... believes Rachel and she's able to go into this interview and put the pressure on Nassau it's not about well why did it take so long for this woman to come forward or maybe she was confused it's very much Nasser needs to be able to answer very simple\nQuestions and you start to hear that he can't he just starts to fall apart\nIf there was a arousal is is this very much because of\n... of whatever well all of a Russian I don't [noise] they actually are rough you know you're just saying that you know you you you um [noise]\nAnd when we interviewed is detected Andrea ... heard one of whom she talks about looking back at the interviews that she herself\nWas kind of I'm sure why NASA our we have so much trouble answering such a simple questions like why would you have interaction during a medical appointment\nI was thinking should ask questions a different way and that pertains to answer and then I thought that was his and he doesn't have one he doesn't have an explanation\nHe doesn't have an explanation so you guys and you're digging you learned that it does make a big difference if if police if parents start\nBy believing the victim worth the very least sharing the victim out yeah well I mean fundamentally\n... this is how guys like this operate is they know that you don't want to believe that somebody you love and trust and who seems like just as great guy\nCould be hurting somebody as humans who are not good at thinking that can happen to the people that we work with or who are family\nBut the reality is that guys like ... don't operate in a vacuum it it takes a lot of people to be manipulated and to fail these women and girls for so long [noise]\nKate Wells and Lindsey Smith are hosts of the new podcast believed from Michigan Radio and NPR thank you both so much\nThanks Noelle Noelle thanks for having us\nThis is Austin's NPR station K.

U. T. dot\nOrg and we thank you very much\nState it covers a long stretch of land that goes from outside El Paso all the way to San Antonio\nAnd we've been visiting different corners of the district talking to voters about what's going through their minds ahead of the mid term elections immigration has become a huge issue leading into these midterms across the country President Trump has seized on to the issue during rallies I had a voting day including the rally that he held here in Houston earlier in the week\nBut we wanted to know how the immigration issue is playing here along the border right now at this very moment I'm looking out over the natural barrier that separates the U.S and Mexico\nIt's lake ... on the Rio Grande river armies Dodd means friendships in Spanish which is appropriate because like other American border towns life in Del Rio is woven together with the town on the other side in Mexico and they'll real case it's the city of a junior Mexico\nWe're family and this border this is Amanda ... her family has lived around Del Rio for generations and our house is just a five minute drive to the border and on the other side is a coon yeah\nI don't know down to them I Am they're equal because I grew up with them but you still don't want them to come here I Want them to come here but I Want them to come here the right way\nAmanda lives with her longtime partner Ralph ... also\nGrow up they're going to be like some tea okay I really would be in a hot humid workers who are highly philosophy is that we could also demand across into a coon yeah a couple of times a week what takes you to I\nHave friends yes and I have um I go shopping over there I go to the dentist over there I buy groceries over their\nAmanda has sympathy for people who are seeking a better life in the U.S but she also has a lot of stories about people she says are gaming the system she tells me she worked for a time at the local jail when she talked with people who got caught coming over the border\nLike you can keep it all because I get on my teeth you know medicine is\nSo you think there are too many illegal immigrants who are exploiting the system yeah\nThat's the part that I don't think makes me very angry what\nDo you make of talk from President Trump when he says he wants to build a wall that would separate Del Rio from Mexico ...\n... ... ... when they separate a while there is a while I don't think anybody back and you went to you can get through\nNow to be clear in parts of the border near Del Rio there is not all there is a big black fence and in other areas there is no manmade barrier at all\nThe rooms rugged terrain\nThis is Joe Frank martini as he's been the sheriff here for the past ten years he is a tall man with weathered skin and white hair and a voice that says he's seen an awful lot and he's harsh conditions\nPeople are prepared for the [noise] we've had those instances where you know people have died out there was such Muslim but we've had three\nOver the past year he's taken an assortment of lawmakers from Washington DC\nOn a tour of the border just like he's doing for us today we drive along the dirt road that runs parallel to Mexico that's\nBefore anybody starts talking\nAbout the border wall\nThe new suit in this natural state\nPeople up north like who is a war zone on her and it's actually not to me before you start throwing money at a problem you have to identify the problem\nTo him the problem is an immigration system that's been broken for fifty years\nAnd he says it can't be fixed with a wall because for starters where would you put it Jeff Martinez drives us up the road where there is no more fence instead there are these houses along the river bank he pulled up on a vacant lot between two homes you know is the owner he tells us it's no problem there perks sheriff\nLittle deserves much at all\nJust across this little yeah if even a river this looks like a link to encourage the ... how many feet\nAre we talking about ah we're probably talking what three hundred feet foreigner feet [noise]\nI mean that's a hard to swim across\nSo at night and someone can just ... just walk up here just like we didn't walk to that road mhm\nI asked sheriff Martinez how the immigration debate is affecting people's politics here and like other folks we spoke to in Del Rio he said it's not top of mind for residents this is a relatively quiet part of the border\nThe people who do sneak in get out quickly and moved to a bigger cities and even the Republican congressman will Hurd has spoken out against the wall he's facing a democratic challenger named Gina Ortiz Jones who's trying to tie her to President Trump\nBut this is a swing district and heard has positioned himself as a moderate and by doing so he's won the support of people like Jeff Martinez\n... come to an air of giving them the same tour [noise] All right well here's your self that our office he uh he's been an advocate for us\nAnd this is interesting because sheriff Martinez like most elected officials here is a Democrat and even though we didn't vote for President Trump and has some issues with his policies and his rhetoric Martinez is pleased about one thing\nThis administration [noise] the sure have been invited to the table [noise] previous administrations we\nWeren't or if we were over there everybody else was even the bones were blown\nThat up to the to solve the immigration issue the sure to be at the table you can't you can't just go to because\nHe knows the battle over immigration is going to go on for a very long time which brings us back to the original question what about that well\nSee my idea was to\nYou can control with technology cameras a sort of put it in the physical structure because where are you going to put it\nHe points to the houses along the river on the U.S side of the border\nAre you going to put these people in Mexico are you going to put these people in the wrong side of the wall\nMeanwhile people like Amanda year a block out the noise it off the wall she will vote for the incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Republican congressman will Hurd and she will keep going back and forth across the border in her\nBackyard as she did with\nAnd just like that were in Mexico\nHave exchange faces rent here where the dollar exchange so this is how can we walked down the main streets filled with bars [noise]\nAnd stores selling all kinds of Mexican handicraft without that one storefront where a woman is selling handmade dolls stressed and colorful dress as\nThey see actually making them is not my sheet and they're not coming from China these are authentic maybe they can I add a check to check in with a smile she not just for a long black hair over her shoulder and waved goodbye Amanda guessing her white SUV and waste and the law in line to cross back\nOver into the U.S [noise] she'll return in a few days though she has dresses that need tailoring\nFrom Del Rio Texas this is NPR News and this is K U T Ninety point five Boston's NPR station thanks so much for tuning in on what shaping up to be a beautiful friday morning here in central

U. T. fall membership drive today you can do your part at K. U. T. dot O. R. G.\nIt's MORNING EDITION on K U T Ninety point five I'm Chana for state and the investigation continues into a series of explosive devices sent this week to prominent Democrats and critics of president Donald Trump\nThe president tweeted he thinks what he calls fake news is responsible for much of today's anger how did the United states reach a point where things like this happen\nTexas out there Ben Fountain covered the twenty sixteen presidential campaign for the British newspaper the guardian and that same question kept coming up for him during and after that election his guardian assignments and some additional thoughts foreign his new book beautiful country burn again\nFountain told me he thinks the country has burned and reinvented itself before the civil war and emancipation and then the great depression and the new deal his book's title implies he thinks we're close again so of course I had to ask him that first when\nWe talked recently not burning now not burning yet but I certainly have the feeling that there's a lot of dry tinder out there and drought conditions I was thinking two thousand two thousand nine the financial crisis I was thinking that could have been it\nWe we're skirting the basis of a genuine existential crisis I'm I mean the global financial system was about to melt down\nWhy are we still that close\nNothing changed the power structure emerged from the crash of two thousand eight intact and there were a few cosmetic changes you know like Doug Frank and uh to to the financial regulatory system but those are being rolled back\nThe big banks have gotten bigger the bankers and making more money than ever um the political parties they certainly look to me like there as corrupt as ever and an unresponsive to working people's needs I think it's obvious that there is a great deal of frustration confusion\nAnd anger I'm among the population at large when Trump said the system is rigged that was a very powerful truth\nThat people were hearing because that had been the lived experience for you know a vast swaths of the population the last twenty five or Thirty years yeah we're working harder than ever\nUm it's getting harder than ever to make ends meet but American productivity has never been stronger and people at the top are just getting richer and richer and richer\nSo I Want to pose that question to ask you that you actually pose in the book and here's what you write\nWhat is it about the American character that allows the long kind of our politics to go on and on electric kirks racists bullies hate mongering preachers corporate bag men and both face liars not always but often the history is damning we must on some level want\nWhat they're offering I think Americans like you know people in every country everywhere we're susceptible to easy fixes to having um\nYou know some of our worst instincts appeal to in the name of you know instant gratification or easy money\nThere are certain prejudices and print elections in ... in the American character that make us susceptible to hug stirs con men people who who are offering you know as smooth the line but really nothing behind and\nNow you write in the book that the Democratic party help put Trump in the White House you believe how is that so\nThirty five years of neo liberal policies promoted by the Democratic establishment beginning in the early Nineteen nineties\nWith um the so called new Democrats which led to the Democratic leadership council and these were movements within the party to pull the party more towards the center and center right a more\nCentrist business oriented\nSlant to the party's platforms people are you know beleaguered frustrated confused and scared and when they don't see a great deal of difference in their economic lives between when Republicans are are in power and Democrats were in power that leaves\nThat is right territory for someone like Donald Trump to enter into the scene\nHaving spent time on the campaign trail I haven't thought about this and synthesize all of this what do we do now than to have or make choices that aren't the same as before or choices that might affect real kind of change whatever that change may be that voters want\nI think I'm politicians need to get real\nAnd a corollary to that is we need to be electing politicians who are real democracy takes a certain level of engagement in participation on the part of the citizenry it requires some level of critical thinking some level of\nPaying attention and trying to inform ourselves about the reality around us\nThese days with so many different kinds of media and so many media agendas coming at us it may be harder than ever\nWe have to be smart and alert you know we have to bring a certain degree of skepticism to what's being put in front of us if we're going to do our job and start you know selecting people who are really going to represent people's interest\nHow did you walk away from this entire process\nI think we are due for a major crisis in American Life I think we're going to be faced with a pivotal choice in the national\nLife of whether we are going to continue\nTo aspire and try to be a genuine democracy where the principle of equality becomes more and more the live reality\nOf the country or it will become this kind of er SATs democracy where we have the trappings of elections but I'm real the real power resides elsewhere\nWere pretty much there right now um I think the ... the oceans of dark money that can pour into elections I'm really tips to scale not completely but\nI think any popular candidate has an uphill battle when I Do think about hopefulness or lack of a take comfort in the fact that America is very is\nIt is never all one thing or all the other it is too many different things I think it leads to this point for one person or one movement to\nHer you know the American nation into a single lane and so I think just sheer diversity and energy\nAnd vitality that new immigrants bring new cultures bring in that re thinking what is the American culture what is the American care to what is it what is the American identity I think as long as there is a vital core to that exploration and they there's a good deal of hope to be had for the country\nThen fountain is the author of beautiful country burning can bend thank you
