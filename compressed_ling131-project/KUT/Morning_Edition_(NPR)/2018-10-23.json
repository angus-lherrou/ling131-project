expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty\nThen Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles but President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same in two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team [noise]\nThey are um not only or the United states and Russia um vastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles and numbers of nuclear weapons but we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the wind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used as growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia is developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatening to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper hand through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority or go at it under the Obama administration\nTo get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests I think the big difference between President Trump and President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy for bringing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out\nA and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms to bring the job or multiple ... and the government is very happy to go along with that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security once we do that\n[noise] what do you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I think I'm going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer serves American interest because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever you want you guys will just have to play catch up um and I think as we've seen a lot of ... more than ... not only playing catch up building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThat there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on the new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one now yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground in Russia Russia inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nI'm from the ministry says there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this was

Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to a relationship with Vassar uh on the basis of so\nThis I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive a examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond\nWell it may be as human rights abuses are not anything new land and the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House during the Obama administration\n[noise] well you know not concerned uh no I mean certainly we hoped that uh the new ... the new crown prince would\nBring about changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia and certainly at times he has made ... towards a reform ah and that looked encouraging a Saudi Arabia has been an important ally\nBut that doesn't mean that we accept everything they do and critically and where are their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more civilian ... civilian casualties\nWe can and must push back a and certainly not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt innocent people are so they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia\nI we certainly can push for deep examination of the intelligence related to this incident but Saudi Arabia more generally that should have bipartisan support the certainly the comments in reaction to the shows you smarter had been very critical and very bipartisan as they should be\nRepresentative Adam Schiff thank you so much for joining us\nThank you President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow for a second day to day he's there to discuss President Trump's pledge to withdraw from an arms control treaty that ban certain kinds of missiles this is one sign that world powers might be returning to an arms race mentality\nNow we have another side efforts by the United states China and Russia to develop a new kind of missile a weapon that can fly faster and farther than almost anything in existence NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the latest\nThese weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour\nThe air force is currently developing hyper sonic weapons including at a place called wind tunnel number nine just outside of Washington DC the money in the morning I showed that damn Mirren who's in charge said the test they were running that they were classified\nI wasn't going to get inside no not at this point but I was allowed in the lobby of the wind tunnel building [noise]\nTheir marriage showed me unclassified version of\nThe things they work on so if you look on this table here we have several of the shapes that we've tested in the winter among the models as a sleek silver ... with the spine down to center is called a wave rider and so it's a fancy way to save rides on its own shock wave\nHere's how the wave writer works the wet shaped warhead would be put on top of a rocket and fired at enormous speeds to the very edge of space then it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes\nBut those missiles just going to straight line\nFrom lunch to target this vehicle would not only be able to come from space that people to turn and bank and and ah [noise] fly almost like a real airplane\nAnd that's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China and Russia they're afraid the u._s. can shoot down their ballistic missiles with missile defense hyper sonic weapon can swerve or take a roundabout route to the target will still going incredibly fast it's essentially unstoppable\nBrenda tested a hundred percent of prototype the flu for more than five minutes it reached beads above four thousand miles per hour according to state media Russia to has been testing and the missile defense round table last month the Pentagon's head of research and development Mike Griffin said he was worried the u._s. was losing its ed\n... we did the groundbreaking research they've chosen to weaponize it we need to respond\nAnd the Pentagon is stepping up to ... percent of extra search\nThere are still some big technical challenges to building these weapons pushing through the air at five or six times the speed of sound generates a lot of friction and friction means heat\nIt hyper sonic speed steel turns sauce like butter in fact the air force tried to build high percentage airplanes into the Nineteen sixties but they kept melting\nMoving towards like hyper some years suddenly forces eventful too that's an archival\nAirforce video showing how one experimental aircraft the ex Fifteen almost burned up during its flight but James acting with the Carnegie Endowment for international peace says advanced materials some super computers are helping hyper sonics we\nAre seeing Russia or the United states and China will conduct I just want to test many of those tests suddenly all of them being successful\nActing also says that ... percent of weapons posts a real threat to the U.S military but he says the solution isn't necessarily to develop our own hyper sonic weapons in response I don't think\nWe should develop high pistol next just because somebody else is doing that ... I think we should do the hype is on it is so specific millet treat problems or fills specific military needs\nFor now the U.S is stepping up testing and back when title nine they're ready to start game on a great game as I said I Can't see anything but Mirren has come up with a solution I can stand out back behind the tunnel in record the rush of airs it moves through the system my ten ten times the speed of sound [noise]\nSo that will knock them sound lock him\nThe tests complete hyper stomach weapons inch a little bit closer to reality Geoff Brumfiel NPR News [noise]\nEighty six Nineteen on this Tuesday Morning I'm Jennifer state and thanks for tuning in for MORNING EDITION here on K U T Ninety eight point five coming up British prime minister Theresa May has been defending her Brexit strategy in parliament\nMade and usually the imminent attacks on her and the press those attacks have been source to members of her own party that story at six thirty five\nSupport comes from Austin granted direct a one stop shop serving often an surrounding cities for twelve years with more than fifty colors of marble granted and engineered stone and design consultation\nNew north often show ... burn it more often granted direct dot com support comes from Austin radiological association reminding Austin nights that October as breast cancer awareness month and mammograms save lives\nMammogram appointments can be scheduled on line at WWW dot a U.

I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning celebrity chef Carla Hall grew up in Nashville where she was raised on soul food\nShe celebrates the food of her childhood in her latest cookbook it's called Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration host spoke to our co host David Greene and she shared a few recipes with him starting with the classic feared okra\nAnd you can just take this okra and slice it in half\nAnd salt and pepper and place it on the grill\nAnd it gets the smoking is that is so wonderful and then you don't have to worry about the slime which I think a lot of people of course misunderstood it can get slimy right I think a lot of people don't like it because I think oh it's slimy\nAnd it's true you use those pods to thicken gumbo and soups and everything so that is one use for it\nBut you can also roasted you consider it you can grill it and\nIt becomes this other textured thing\nSo am I right I mean when I think of soul food I often think of of stuff that might not be that healthy life ... chicken maybe fried okra this or are you giving us like a healthier version of soul food or soul food misunderstood I mean I Know that fried chicken in your book we should make that clear but got there's fried chicken but they're more vegetables and fried chicken so ... what does it tell us about food\nI think that it is misunderstood I think there's a small piece that people know of soul food when you go to a soul food restaurant\nThe people who own that restaurant again to give you those celebration dishes that are going to bring you in\nWhen you are around the table and people from the outside come into your home you're celebrating so of course you're going to have Mac and cheese and some other pork chops and fried chicken and ribs and all of these things because that's what you do even in other cultures that's what you do so I think that\nSoul food that stuck there because this is what people are eating because they're celebrating and going to restaurants but people aren't having fried chicken every day because they couldn't kill their chickens I needed the eggs [noise]\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was you distinguish between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind the differences in your mind\nPeople okay [laughter] and black people\nUm I think it's also the difference between a him an integral spiritual okay you know you get to saying the same song but even if if you were doing a note like oh and then you have some other\n\nThe other notes that are being song or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from\nSo that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say a sustained on it but it's a stay on it you know you're putting that heart and it is coming from some place deep in\nYour soul that you are getting out and and just\nWanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's an agro spiritual [noise] well speaking of\nOf pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the self ah for this book and in one of the stuff you're made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregations himself there were churches hundred Ninety nine birthday but this was also a ... so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on worshippers just over three years ago and in just a men's tragedy for for a whole country what what was\nThat experience like we had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration\nAnd it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nWay because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef and she didn't care but the nature of the kids so it was like I'm trying to get this re past food\nDone and you all are in the way um but they had all of these pots going in\nAnd then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy that happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a task\nTo other people and it is serious it was really beautiful and it was it was about the congregation coming together and there was a tragedy but there was also you knew that they had each other\nAnd that anybody who came into the church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing [noise] well\nOne more recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about some hot water ... this is not your average cornbread Carla this is something different right\nIt is not your average cornbread if you're not from the south [laughter]\nEveryone was ... he joined but I I I've certainly have much of cornbread and loved it but hot water or vote of having a sort of what what what what what would I be doing for tried to make this\nHot water corn bread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers being in those patio so she would make little oval once my mother and makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it doesn't mean seriously it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the\nThe larger\nThings that you were learning about yourself through this project\nI must say that this was a personal journey with this book\nI set out to tell this story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more and people outside of the community could understand what it is and\nAnd sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook the food but also the look at what their personal ... is and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines more I realized I was carrying a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and\nWhat it is but I had a chip on my shoulder and so it come out sideways and ... and you know uh and now it is just a love\nFor this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines ...

for the regular scientific survey that pays special attention to the race and gender of respondents professor Hi\nHello David\n... get used to know a comedian who had the ... discuss some problem any problem and then ask what's my point more money for education you would say is the answer to every single problem that's in a sense what you found when the question is education\nI think that's true clearly millennials have has seen his routine when we ask young people any number of questions about the best way to improve\nPublic education they always circle back to increasing funding for public education so they want to pay teachers more they want to invest in neighborhoods schools and overall they want to give more funding to public education\nAnd one of the features you surveys that you do green data based on the race of the responded and the gender what what did you find in Missouri a difference depending on who is answering\nIn this case it doesn't seem to matter very much overwhelming a young people I don't want to say independent of race and ethnicity but with their races and ethnicities support this idea of increasing funding for education on any number of dimensions\nSo uh this is a pretty consistent finding that seems to kind of extend across race and ethnicity\nAnd how would your respondents use the money if there were more money for education\n[noise] well they do a number of different things right there is a clear sense\nAnd the findings that young people believe that the most effective way to impact public education is through really those kinds of relationships in the classroom that if given a priority with a limited amount of money they want to give it to teachers they want to support teachers they want to strengthen teachers' unions\nWhat about views of if it's not exactly public school I'm Talking about private school but also talking about the charter school movement\nYeah it's complicated I guess I Would say in the sense that young people are looking to improve education so they're supporting any number of strategies\nThey are supportive of increasing the number of charter schools they are supportive of providing vouchers using government funds for in particular low income students but I Want to go back and say when given a list that says here are a number of options for it and\nBeing public

of the Saudi led coalition in Yemen in two thousand in Fifteen which has been responsible for killing tens of thousands of civilians with the help of American Life and now that includes children has your position on this coalition changed\nIt has changed and certainly changed to before the cars showed you murder it did Oh yes I you know it can ... the Saudis are were intent on pushing back though who these who were trying to take over the country dreaded oppose uh the legitimate government of Yemen a and we're getting around and help to do it\nBut we've seen over the course of time that the Saudis have become increasingly I'm a willing to allow civilian casualties uh to bomb a more or less indiscriminately\nUh we shouldn't be providing military assistance that enables them to do that\nSo I think I'll reexamine they should certainly have our support for Saudi and the war in Yemen is overdue but I think what the ... murder does also is\nIt tells us we need a broader re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia not just these are the Yemen but is this really um the country boy we want to paint her entire Middle East policy on we want to make decisions about ah our support to a relationship with Vassar or on the basis of so\nThis I I think ought to cause us to do a deep dive examination of\nUs how to conduct a relationship with Saudi Arabia across the board and inappropriately respond\nWell it may be as human rights abuses are not anything new and and the U.S has remained close ally for years were you concerned when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House during the Obama administration\n[noise] well it you know not concerned you know I mean certainly we hoped that uh the new ... the new crown prince would\nBring about changes and reforms in Saudi Arabia and certainly at times he has made nods towards a reform ah and that looked encouraging a Saudi Arabia has been an important ally\nBut that doesn't mean that we accept everything they do and critically and where are their prosecution of the war in Yemen is resulting in more and more civilian ... civilian casualties we can and must a push back a and certainly not allow our military assistance to to be used to uh hurt innocent people\nAre so they're important ally but they're not one that we want to rely on exclusively for foreign policy in the region\nAnd very briefly there's been partisan disagreement on your committee are you in a position to push any action forward on Saudi Arabia\nI we certainly can push for the ... nation of intelligence related to this incident but Saudi Arabia more generally that should have bipartisan\nSupport the certainly the comments reaction to the shows you murder I've been very critical and very bipartisan as they should be\nRepresentative Adam Schiff thank you so much for joining us\nThank you President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow for a second day to day he's there to discuss

latest\nThese weapons are called hyper sonic weapons and they are fast really fast by definition they travel at least five times the speed of sound thousands of miles per hour the air force is

at enormous speeds to the very edge of space then it would detach from the rocket and glad to its target\nNow big countries like the U.S China and Russia already have weapons that can do something like this they're called intercontinental ballistic missiles and they can hit anywhere on the planet in minutes but\nThose missiles just going to straight line\nFrom launched to target this go with not only be able to come from space but people to turn and bank and and the fly almost like a real airplane and\nThat's the real appeal of hyper sonics especially for China Russia they're afraid the

food of her childhood in her latest cookbook it's called Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration hosts look to our co host David Greene and she shared a few recipes with him starting with the classic feared okra\nYou can just take this okra and slice it in half and salt and pepper and place it on the grill\nAnd it gets the smoking is that is so wonderful and then you don't have to worry about the\nSlime which I think a lot of people Oprah's misunderstood it can get slimy right I think a lot of people don't like it because I think oh it's slimy and it's true you use those\nPods to thicken gumbo and soups and everything so that is one use for it but you can also roasted you consider it you can grill it and it becomes this other textured\nThing so am I right I mean when I think of soul food I often think of of stuff that might not be that healthy like fried chicken may be fried okra this\nAre you giving us like a healthier version of soul food or to soul food misunderstood I mean I Know that fried chicken under but we should make that clear but got there's fried chicken but they're more vegetables and fried chicken so ... what does that tell us about so I think that\nIt is misunderstood I think there's a small piece that people know a soul food when you go to a soul food restaurant\nThe people who own that restaurant again to give you the celebration dishes that are going to bring you and\nWhen you are around the table and people from the outside come into your home you're celebrating so of course you're going to have Mac and cheese and some other pork chops and fried chicken and ribs and all of these things because that's what you do even in other cultures that's what you do so I think\nThat soul food that stuck there because this is what people are eating because they're celebrating and going to restaurants but people aren't having fried chicken every day because they couldn't kill their chickens I needed the eggs [noise]\nOne of the the real smile moments I'm reading the book was you distinguishing between soul food and southern food [laughter]\nCan you remind us what the differences in your\nMind black people okay [laughter] [laughter] and black\nPeople um I think it's also the difference between a him and a negro spiritual\nYou know you can saying the same song but even if if you are doing a no like oh and then you have some other\n\nDon't other notes that are being sung or not on the paper but it is something about stealing that song and where that emotion came from\nSo that is like our food it is it's a and I don't want to say a sustained on it but it's a stay on it you know you're putting that heart and that is coming from some place deep in\nYour soul that you are getting out and and just wanting to pull somebody in and say I see you I feel the pain that you've been through that's an agro spiritual\n[noise] well speaking of of pain that people have been through um I I Know you you took a journey through the self ah for this book and then one of the stops you made was a mother Emanuel one of\nThe oldest black congregation some itself it was the churches hundred Ninety my birthday but this was also a ... so many of us know where a gunman opened fire on worshipers just over three years ago and and just an immense tragedy for for a whole country what what was\nThat experience like we had second thoughts about going there um because\nIt was there was so much pain but then because we were in town um we decided to go in Charleston so in ... in Charleston South Carolina and they were having a celebration\nAnd it was so beautiful and we went to the kitchen and we're in the way [laughter]\nAway because you're like a ... of the famous celebrity chef that right now I see I didn't care but the major that kids so it was like I'm trying to get this ... past\nFood done and you all are in the way um but they had all of these pots going in and then just this huge kitchen and there's a hierarchy\nThat happens in the kitchen especially at these churches were these these women are getting this food out and then there's this one woman who's the best cook who was doling out a task\nTo other people and it is serious it was really beautiful it was it was about the congregation coming together\nAnd there was a tragedy but there was also you knew that they had each other and that anybody who came into that church that day was part of that family and it was just a beautiful thing [noise] well one\nMore recipe from the book I wanted to ask you about um hot water corn bread so this is not your average cornbread Carla this is something different right\nIt is not your average cornbread if you're not from the south okay [laughter]\nPeople themselves you know exactly what you're talking about I I I've certainly have much of corn bread and loved it but hot water or having a sort of what what what what what would I be doing with it or if I tried to make this\nHot water cornbread um you start with white corn meal you boil water and the corn meal there is salt and there is a little bit of baking powder\nAnd the hot water actually cooks the corn meal and then you make it into little patties and I always remember my grandmother's fingers being in those Patty so she would make little oval ones my mother and makes round ones whatever ... whatever shape and size you want and then you fry it and that\nBut it doesn't mean Susie it sounds like this recipe really carries a lot of the\nThe larger\nThings that you were learning about yourself through this project\nI must say that this was a personal journey with this book I set out to tell this story so that African Americans could appreciate the food more\nPeople outside of the community to understand what it is and and sort of maybe be inspired to not only cook the food but also to look at what their personal ... and what their food from their culture looks like\nBut I got more from it I think I appreciate other cuisines more I realize I was carrying a chip on my shoulder about my food and wanting it to be special and and having this this moment or not just a moment but to be realized at and\nWhat it is but I had a chip on my shoulder and so it come out sideways and ... and you know uh and now it is just a law for this food and a deeper appreciation for other cuisines ... love talking to you thank you for for come back on and best of luck with the book\nThank you so much as it's been such a pleasure [noise]\nThe book\nIs called the Carla Hall soul food everyday and celebration [noise]\nIt's

U. T. dot ORG hockey\nNow one of the things I'm really noticing this morning as sort of we're integrating ourselves a little differently and to MORNING EDITION than we usually do but we we need to do that during these membership drives it's very important thing you know these stories are seven minutes seven and a half minutes four and a half minutes four minutes you know\nThese days it's easy to keep up with the headlines like you know I can pick up my phone and I can see some tweets I can see the headlines I can sort of\nRun through and look at the you know cable news scrawled across the bottom there you can find that sort of all over the place but it's understanding what's going on behind those headlines\nIt's hard to do but in some ways I think it's more important than ever to understand really deeply what's going on and I think that's why the work of the journalists here at K. U. T. and at NPR and the BBC you know all of their work revolves around kind of getting to that deeper\nSet of facts that deeper understanding that deeper truth finding it and verifying it and reporting it out to everybody you know the the journalist that all of these organizations including Katie worked very hard to find those facts\nAnd put those facts in the context that is what credibility is all about and\nWe know from the listener comments we've been getting this morning that we get all the time that you all appreciate that also and that's why you keep coming back to K. U. T. to get local news coverage to get the coverage from NPR and the BBC and marketplace we know that that is very important to you and we are proud to be able to bring you that kind of coverage\nAnd during these members that Dr we simply just take a moment to say hey you know what we need some help paying the bills it's pretty much as simple as that and I know for K. U. T. it's local support of listeners and local businesses makes up the vast\nMajority of the support that we get here a K. U. T.\nIt's over eighty percent of our revenue we get about a little less than five percent from the federal government through the corporation for public broadcasting the rest of that comes from\nFoundations a and organizations or that make donations public radio and uh with over eighty percent of our revenue coming directly from the community uh people like you who make these contributions during the membership drives and the great businesses supportive throughout the year\nAlong Mexico's western Pacific coast\nThey've been boarding up windows and evacuating homes speeches and fishing villages ahead of hurricane Wilma the category ... storm is expected to make landfall later today and their moslem it has topped sustained winds of one hundred thirty miles per hour\nWill remains more than one hundred miles off the coast National Hurricane center says flooding in mountainous landslides are likely\n[noise] this is NPR News from Washington\nSupport comes from Texas oncology with a reminder that October as breast cancer awareness month to eight early detection all women over the age of forty should undergo routine screening like nearly mammograms\n[noise] figures for kids entering the juvenile justice system in Texas I mean going down state wide\nWith too conspicuous exceptions to judges accounting for nearly a fifth of all she had said into the system and Ninety six percent of them African American\nThe story but ...

U. T. without a strong base of membership thanks to everybody who is already a member if you're a listener but not a member yet how about the coming our newest sustaining member during the summer membership drive you can do that quickly easily and securely at K.

mover dot com\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he's expected to give a press briefing later detail how the U.S will pull out of a Cold War era and nuclear arms treaty then Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty prevented Russia and the U.S from having certain intermediate range missiles\nBut President Trump says Russia is in violation of the agreement it's worth noting the Obama administration said the same and two thousand fourteen\nAnd then yesterday President Trump said that the U.S in fact plans to expand its nuclear arsenal until other nations in his words come to their senses John ... is with me now he's the director of the nuclear Crisis Group and former special assistant to President Obama can morning sir\nGood morning I said we are hearing the term arms race thrown around is this language and are these developments warring team\n[noise] they are um not only are the United states and Russia um\nVastly increasing their nuclear capabilities their missiles or numbers of nuclear weapons but we're no longer engaging with each other we're sort of operating in the wind and the chances that we could miss calculate misunderstand or stumble into a crisis where nuclear weapons could be used is growing\nAll right so so time to be very careful you served on the national Security Council under President Obama and and you were there when he accused Russia of violating this treaty the U.S did not withdraw then why not\n[noise] so we're very concerned that Russia is developed a small number of missiles which are banned by the treaty and deployed them\nBut they haven't produced them in numbers that really threatened to change the military situation in Europe we still have the upper him through NATO Russia's building these the counter our conventional superiority our goal ... and under the Obama administration to get Russia back into the treaty because it serves our interests\nI think the big difference between President Trump the President Obama is President Trump really doesn't have a strategy preparing Russia back in\nA is really happy just to pull out a and John Bolton who was killed a number of arms to bring the job or multiple ... and the government uh is very happy to go along with you that strategy but there is NO PLAN for how you improve American security wants to be due to\nWhat you think John Bolton is going to say today\n[noise] I think they're going to say you can't cheat on American get away with it I'm the same thing he told the north Koreans back in two thousand and two um he's going to say this treaty no longer shrubs American interest because you cheated on it\nUm and we're going to go or merry way and build whatever you want you guys will just have to catch up um and I think as we've seen a lot of ... ... more than ... not only playing catch up on a building systems which undermine our security and we're going to be adding fuel to the arms race that were already in\nThat there's another nuclear arms reduction treaty that I Know a lot of people have an eye on new start treaty which is due to expire in two thousand and Twenty one now yesterday John Bolton said the U.S has not finalized its position on extending new start briefly remind us what it is and what happens if it expires\nSo new start is the last a strategic arms control agreement in place in the United states and Russia it puts American inspectors on the ground and Russia Russia and inspectors on the ground in the United states and it limits both countries to know more than Fifteen hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nI'm from the ministry says there's office two years how they haven't figured out that this was in our interest is beyond me but if it goes away we will be looking at a Russian program that grows up even more than it has and we will be like we have to increase our own spending on in our own deployments\nJohn ... of the nuclear Crisis Group thanks so much\nThanks for having [noise]\nAll right Steve the mega millions lottery is up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B the drawing set for tonight and yes it's a very exciting but your chances our chances about one in three hundred million now some people come up with plans to improve\nTheir odds in a big one is getting a bunch of coworkers together and forming an office pool what about that\nOne and three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million um they're both astronomical so the odds are basically the same\nJason Kirkland is a lawyer who represents jackpot winters and he says if your\nOffice pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with this book\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's in the Grover out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been above where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group whatever them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're on his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those so I Would never say not to understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that\nThe last thing in the art twenty people twenty lawyers or going to court and fighting over this and find the money up for years or or God Knows how much\nIf you do when you need a lawyer he will probably take your call unless he's the one who wins\n\nThis is NPR News and they say ... K U T Ninety point five Austin's NPR station some helpful advice there and tonight is that drawing for mega millions\nIt is the largest jak pot in us history and uh whether you win the big prize is up to chance how the pot that to be so big well that was a deliberate choice that and more on the marketplace morning report you can hear that\nAt nine fifty one support comes from Texas oncology with a reminder that October as breast cancer awareness month to aid early detection all women over the age of forty should undergo routine screening like yearly mammograms more at Texas oncology dot com\nCloudy skies in the forecast for central Texas today forty percent chance of rain\nA high near sixty four degrees cities fifty five in Georgetown\nGood morning from the BBC in London who need to do see with BBC talkline some of our top ... stories this hour\nThe un refugee agency is sending teams to southern Mexico to provide support to the most vulnerable of migrants arriving from across the border in Guatemala Adrian Edwards from the un agency are told the BBC it is not clear the migrants will make it to the U.S\nIs not the first ... of people that have moved in this region there was something of a history of a frequent that don't get very far we're already seeing people in the Gulf going back and we'll have to walk with our number is but there were long way away from ...
