the news is next\nWhat's really important question I think that a lot of pollsters or at least on the Democratic side are being more conservative in how they are waiting the data that they're receiving in and perhaps presenting a more pessimistic outlook than they might otherwise have\nI Know also got many pollsters are taking steps that they hadn't taken before\nTo more carefully choose the people who they're interviewing for their surveys because part of the problem as far as we can tell coming out of sixteen was we weren't always capturing a per se snapshot of the electorate\nBut I think what this comes down to at the end of the day is the polls are at best just a snapshot anytime we still have a ways to go people started voting in some great but\nTo rest on our morals or to take for granted that we're going to win the house it it's not smart and we have to continue to press and fight this election out every single day\nRubbing milk was campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen talking to him about the Democratic party and the party strategy heading into this election thanks so much we always appreciate it\nMy pleasure thank you\nAnd NPR's Tamara Keith has been listening to that conversation she covers the White House for NPR hey there Tam good morning where you are very involved in covering the twenty sixteen campaign that sounds like a ... team Clinton still thinking about what they might have taken for granted and what not wanting to to repeat that in twenty Eighteen\nYeah and and one thing that stood out to me is he talks about ah how Republicans may have done some damage for themselves among women a female voters in the cabinet outside\nYou know at the Clinton campaign and others thought that President Trump had at then candidate Trump had done a lot of damage with female voters uh with that Access Hollywood video that came out just about a year ago I just about two years ago right on but ultimately white women\nVoted for Donald Trump they they broke for for Trump in the end um and and what we've seen in a lot of our polling is that gender is important that party is everything\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment because I Know Kevin all we heard him at the White House um as he did the ceremonial swearing in saying he wants to move past\nThe bitterness he does not feeling bitter as he takes on this new job President Trump seems to be taking a of a of less pleasant tone when he's out there campaigning about this\nYeah well a cabinet is going to be on this spring is on the Supreme Court at President Trump is trying to win and mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and\nDo what they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the site\nAnd um and you know the emotion of happiness and contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration\nAnd and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that feeling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do we're living in a world where you never know when a what seems like a big stories suddenly going to go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain kind of in the talking points and agendas of both parties in in this one month that we have left or are there are other issues that are gonna be coming up the voters going to really can be thinking about\nWell there are absolutely other issues at ... in the end\nIt's hard to say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and\nAnd and the fight over President Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up um that hasn't gotten a ton of attention is health care um and and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away a pre existing condition\nThere are affirmative Lee going out there and doing ads about pre existing conditions because democratic candidates have made it such an issue um and and it's it's resonating with voters appear Samara Keith Tam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife\nBut many farmers in Arkansas are defined the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill weeds it don't farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba [noise]\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of pesticide ... honestly I don't think anybody in the whole world dreamed\nThat ... could create such a nice you bring so many farmers against farmers that gamut in stay where it belonged to drifted across the landscape been injured millions of acres of regular crops [noise]\nIt was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and stay plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year ... known your neighbor and your friend\nThat's not my definition of good for business so the plant or asked the most dramatic limits on die can but in the whole country no die campus spring during the growing season the summer I called Terry fuller back see how it was going\nAnd he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees in people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year scripts liquor it it's just been a sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation the plant boards investigators try to catch the outlaw farmers\nInspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them in at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now could face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation\nI talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive a couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way\nAnd by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming by the rules like had now personally I don't believe in spraying dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray\nI mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming so he didn't plant those new dicamba tolerant crops he got rid of weeds with other chemicals are you not one drop of ... by the same as it can be done\nIt's a myth and then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up that can be had blown in from some other farmers field do I go out and try to which people and find out I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a farmer to\nKeep a crop that is not damaged by somebody else's sprayed that legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't get injured\nAnd then he'd be tempted to spray dot camera

David Greene in Culver City California Good morning Google is shutting down its consumer version of Google Plus your social network but some sauces and sort of Facebook\nThis comes after a flaw was discovered that might have exposed personal information\nOf hundreds of thousands of customers according to the wall Street Journal that flow was discovered in March but the company decided not to disclose is with us in our studio in Washington DC is one of the reporters who broke this story Doug McMillan thanks for being here hike the morning\nSo can you start by telling us about this flood of you and your colleagues at the wall Street Journal discovered I mean what what information could have gotten out here\nYes over a two year two to three year period from twenty Fifteen until earlier this year or people who entered their profile information into Google Plus um information like their gender birth date\n... ... email address all that data could have been available to outside developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is abuser is small it's only about half a million users which in the world of kind of potential data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focused on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed or didn't\nDo right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that that their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that they're telling which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there is no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell you users\nBut our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nA forwarded this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this\nThe Facebook Cambridge Analytica data breach happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny of Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation and a bigger way ... well\nHave they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took a pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in a some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside developers on an Android phones um for things like gee now there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to\nTo and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels in the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this was at a situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google's they care about\nPrivacy I think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust\n'em it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people in in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you know can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who

talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because politics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's\nStill going on we're very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationship and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable\nTo talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders who might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your coworkers mad or just make it hard for them to concentrate so you've got to be respectful of that that\nIt also at some levels of diversity issue because if you have a model culture you hire only people who agree with\nThe boss politically that's going to cut out some talent\nI think that's a problem that I hear that from ... is that they're working in an office where their political views are very different from most people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drawing them into conversations sort of [laughter] making them feel complicit in the points that they find pretty harmful or offensive\nLarge these days to pull this off in recent days the Supreme Court nomination hearings I've been going on and even if someone is resolved I'm not going to talk about this work regardless of what side of that\nParticular issue one is you can imagine someone looking at the TV and saying\nOh you know one way or another and it's a little hard to suppress all of one's reaction\nI think it can be useful to to get it from the other side if your coworker we're talking about a candidate all the time who you found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their office preventing them and they act the way that you thought of that person may impact the relationship in subtle ways and there's no reason that you need to inject\nInto your workplace there are a lot of

Paul reminds her that she has the music inside of her\nThey start saying and they\nFind the voice within that or pacify them and makes the storms seem a little less frightening\nAnd you know catch when I thought about that are basically\nTelling the story of the blues this music where you'd have people with nothing or are close to nothing looking to music within themselves when times are their toughest\nWell I I Know for me that in my darkest hour there's always been a song that has helped me to transcend\nAnd certainly the story of country music and the story of the blues which I really want in the same the story of hardworking and oftentimes impoverished people looking for that boat across dark waters\nYou chose to make your characters African American and the illustrations in this book where and why was that decision\nMade when I first heard this story I heard it from a woman of Cherokee dissent a woman named Lorraine\nShe had a pet crow when she was a kid on her dad's form and this crow used to steal everything and bury it all around the farm they'd find the\nBits of string or or um cellophane or tinfoil\nIn my mind Lorraine was a hillbilly girl of Cherokee descent\nNow it took a long time to get this book finished um but really the big part of the time was getting it published and ah and then finding an illustrator\nAnd it wasn't until maybe four years passed before the publisher said sorry catch we can't really find the right illustrator would you like to search\nAnd I found on the listing of a local art college Higgins bond here in Nashville Higgins is a really important children's illustrator in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and then stops working for a long time\nHiggins is the reason that Lorraine is African American because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShe also says she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of is that something we're seeing in your book\nYes and the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond\nIs that I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and uh in one of the places where I'm often reading literacy and and mentorship program for kids\nI'll read any number of book ... with this book I have the opportunity to now read a story in which the characters looked like the audience\nI'm interested in your volunteering and and I know you also helped found a private school in Nashville right I mean it it sounds like your commitment to education as part of where the Trump or came from yeah they all sort of come\nAround the same forces to draw up for me this passion about education as a kid I Lived in all these different towns five pounds by the fifth grade my parents were educators\nSo it turned out that I had it in me to start a school and then these kind of volunteer gigs really helped me to say oh I'm I think I could see a school in the parking lot by the shores of this rushing interstate with the two expressway spurs and the the shoney's in the wake shop\nThat parking lot's got to school growing in it we just need to plant the seats is that where you put the school was it by wakes up in his ...\nYeah that sounds like what better place to put the newest Episcopal school in the nation [laughter]\nI Love it was this a different experience writing a book compared to reading some\nI think writing songs and writing a children's book are really kind of one in the same you want to get a tagline or a refrain you want to have language that's easy to remember there was a sing song quality to this book it's in ...\nIt makes me want to ask you and I don't know if you'd be comfortable or not but if would you sing a page of the book like even the ending if if that's something I don't know if you've you've thought about putting it to music\nI'd love to go ahead and [noise] let's see what should our melody be I'm going to leave it up to you know

next\n\nIt's a really important question I think that a lot of pollsters at least on the Democratic side are being more conservative in how they are waiting the data that they're receiving in and perhaps presenting a more pessimistic outlook than they might otherwise have\nI Know all that many pollsters are taking steps that they hadn't taken before\nTo more carefully choose the people who they're interviewing for their surveys because part of the problem as far as we can tell coming out of sixteen was we weren't always capturing per se snapshots of the electorate\nBut I think what this comes down to at the end of the day is\nThe polls are at best just a snapshot anytime we still have a ways to go people started voting in some great but\nTo rest on our morals or to take for granted that we're going to win the house ... ... it's not smart and we have to continue to press and fight this election out every single day\nRobbie ... campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen talking about the Democratic party and the party strategy heading into this election thanks so much we always appreciate it\nMy pleasure thank you\nAnd NPR's Tamara Keith has been listening to that conversation she covers the White House for NPR hey there Tam good morning when you were very involved in covering the twenty six team campaign that sounds like a ... team Clinton still thinking about what they might have taken for granted and what not wanting to to repeat that in twenty eight team\nYeah and and one thing that stood out to me is he talks about how Republicans may have done some damage for themselves among women a female voters in the cabinet outside\nYou know the Clinton campaign and others thought that President Trump had at then candidate Trump had done a lot of damage with female voters are with that Access Hollywood video that came out just about two years ago right on but ultimately white women\nVoted for Donald Trump they they broke for for Trump in the end um and and what we've seen in a lot of our polling is that gender is important that party is everything\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment because I Know Kevin we heard him at the White House as he did the ceremonial swearing in saying he wants to move past\nThe bitterness he does not feeling bitter as he takes on this new job President Trump seems to be taking a tone when he's out there campaigning about this\nYeah well a cabin I is going to be on this spring is on the Supreme Court at President Trump is trying to win a mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and\nWhat they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the state\nAnd you know the emotion of happiness and contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration and and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that feeling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do are living in a world where you never know when a what seems like a big story of a sudden we're going to go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain that kind of in the talking points and agendas of both parties in in this one month that we have left or are there are other issues that are gonna be coming up the voters going to really can be thinking about\nWell there are absolutely other issues are in the end it's hard\nTo say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and\nAnd and the fight over President Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up that hasn't gotten a ton of attention is health care\nAnd and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away a pre existing conditions there affirmatively going out there and doing ads about pre existing conditions because\nDemocratic candidates have made it such an issue and it's it's resonating with voters\nAnd post hammer Keith Tam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state

developers if basically if your friend had signed up\nTo some Google Plus at those developers potentially could have gotten access to this data\nThe number to potentially affected number is of user is small it's only about half a million users which in the world is kind of central data breaches that is not a member of the real questions that are reporting focus on our kind of what Google did\nWhen did find out this this this uh you know the security patches ... existed\nOr didn't do right I mean they they didn't go public and let people know that their their privacy might have been at risk\nWhy yeah so there's sort of the story that their talent which is they took a look at what happened they investigated these apps to some extent\nThey found that there was no suspicious activity and they decided that there was no evidence of a misuse of data so they had no obligation to tell users but our reporting shows that there was another factor at play which was they were worried about the repercussions of coming\nA forwarded this information or you know earlier this year right right of the time they discovered this\nThe face but Cambridge Analytica data breach and just happened um there's a lot of regulator scrutiny of Facebook in tech companies and how they're handling data and internally they were worried about being pulled into this conversation in a bigger way ...\nWhat have they responded to your reporting and I I guess also they said anything about how they might prevent this from happening in\nThere they took a pretty drastic step which is they now you said earlier they ... they announced they're closing the consumer side of Google Plus which is pretty big stuff there also taking um a number of steps to kind of rain in a some data privacy\nPotential problems or they make a lot of data available to outside of developers on an Android phones um for things like gee now there are there are a lot of different apps that can you can use to to and those developers can also get your data so they're taking some steps to shut down some of those channels\nIn the short term that could actually hurt some of their relationship to developers\nBut they're saying that in the long term maybe this was\nA situation like this from happening again\nBased on your reporting should people feel safe using Google they care about privacy\nI think that there are some real questions that users have to ask themselves about trust on it and the situation there was a pretty serious decision being made about how to handle a situation involving sensitive personal data\nAnd there was no transparency into that decision the you know these people and in a room in Mountain View decided how to handle a sensitive issue around user data so can users you know can Google Keep the trust of its users going forward I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to to get that trust back\nDoesn't villain covers Google for the wall Street Journal who joined

because Higgins is African American in fact she's the first African American woman to design a U.S postage stamp\nI was talking to the actress Viola Davis recently about a children's book that she's done she was saying two things one is there is an incredible need for characters of color in children's books it's been a void that's existed for very long time\nShe also says she loves when you have say characters of color but there doesn't have to be some explanation or reason for it what do you think of that is that's something we're seeing in your book\nYes and the thing that was missing and really waited until I discovered Higgins bond is\nThat I I really wanted Lorraine to be an African American girl you know what I Do a lot of volunteer work around communities of color and in one of the places where I'm often reading literacy and and mentorship program for kids\nI'll read any number of books ... with this book I have the opportunity to now read a story in which the characters look like the audience\nI'm interested in your volunteering and and I know you also helped found a private school in Nashville right I mean it it sounds like your commitment to education as part of where this terms what came from yeah they all sort of\nCome around the same forces to draw up for me this passion about education as a kid I Lived in all these different towns five pounds by the fifth grade my parents were educators\nSo it turned out that I had it in me to start a school and then these kind of volunteer gigs really helped me to say oh I'm I think I could see a school in the parking lot by the shores of this rushing interstate with the two expressway spurs and the the ... and the weight shop\nThat parking lot's got to school growing in it we just need to plant the seeds is that what you put the school is it by wakes up in his ...\nYeah that's what I thought what better place to put the newest Episcopal school in\nThe nation as lovers was this a different experience writing a book compared to reading some\nI think writing songs and writing a children's book are really kind of one in the same you want to get a tagline or a refrain you want to have language that's easy to remember there's a sing song quality to this book\nIn I ...\nIt makes me want to ask you and I don't know if you'd be comfortable or not but if would you sing a page of the book like even the ending if if that's something I don't know if you've you've thought about putting it to music\nI'd love to go ahead and let's see what should our melody be I'm going to leave it up to you know the expert oh man they broke into song with their hearts all a\nGlobal why am I came to the ... the crew he was perched on the stump above the old\n... pin dance and adjusted with a mischievous gr in than the clouds parted ways as the music grows high and the sunshine sparkling gold in the Tennessee sky\nWell what better way to go up and that catch is always such a pleasure talking to you and the best of luck with this new journey to sort of\nHey thank you David ...\nCatch the core children's author or the man in old crow medicine showed ban probably best\nThis is MORNING EDITION from\nNPR News I'm

laying passed me on the right now I'm I'm okay with that but one day it was too much\nThat was a day I was coming home and we should be from one of those office parks on a hill there came a guy on a skateboard went down the hill he got him to break down like any past all of us in our parade or stall cars I thought this is Austin\nHoly here can escape it around fast [noise] my name is Lynn Barton and you're listening to K U T Ninety point five [noise]\n[noise] well what's really important question I think that a lot of pollsters at least on the Democratic side are being more conservative in how they are waiting the data that they're receiving in and perhaps presenting a more pessimistic outlook than they might otherwise have\nI Know also got many pollsters are taking steps that they hadn't taken before\nTo more carefully choose the people who they're interviewing for their surveys because part of the problem as far as we can tell coming out of sixteen was we weren't always capturing per se snapshots of the electorate\nBut I think what this comes down to at the end of the day is the polls are at best just a snapshot and are we still have a ways to go people started voting in some great but\nTo rest on our morals or to take for granted that we're going to win the house it it's not smart and we have to continue to press and fight this election out every single day\nRubbing milk was campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen talking about the Democratic party and the party strategy heading into this election thanks so much we always appreciate it\nMy pleasure thank you and NPR's Tamara Keith has been listening to that conversation she covers the White House for NPR hey there Tam good morning\nWhen you were very involved in covering the twenty sixteen campaign it sounds like a ... team Clinton's still thinking about what they might have taken for granted and what not wanting to to repeat that in twenty eight team\nYeah and and one thing that stood out to me is he talks about how Republicans may have done some damage for themselves among women a female voters in the cabinet outside you know the Clinton campaign and others thought that President Trump had at then candidate Trump had done a lot of damage with female voters\nAre with that Access Hollywood video that came out just about two years ago right on but ultimately white women voted for Donald Trump they they broke for for Trump in the end um and and what we've seen in a lot of our polling is that gender is important that party is everything\n... well let's talk about President Trump for a moment because I Know Kevin ... we heard him at the White House as he did the ceremonial swearing in saying he wants to move past\nThe bitterness he does not feeling bitter as he takes on this new job President Trump seems to be taking a tone when he's out there campaigning about this\nYeah well a cabin I is going to be on this spring is on the Supreme Court at President Trump is trying to win a mid term and are trying to keep his party in power and\nWhat they discovered is that Republican voters were fired up by the state and you know the emotion of happiness and contentment is not as strong as the emotion of anger and frustration\nAnd and resentment and President Trump and Republicans want to keep that ceiling going keep their voters upset and angry because they believe that will get them out to the polls and get them voting Republican\nI mean you know as well as I Do are living in a world where you never know when a what seems like a big story of a sudden we're going to be ... go away and there's going to be the next big story but\nAny sense of of whether this Kevin a fight is going to remain kind of in the talking points in the genders both parties in in this one month that we have left or are there are other issues that are going to be coming up the voters going to really can be thinking about\nThere are absolutely other issues at in the end\nIt's hard to say whether issues will will decide this or whether it will really just be a battle of enthusiasm and\nAnd and the fight over President Trump and and Trump ism but one thing that keeps coming up that hadn't gotten a ton of attention is health care\nAnd and that is an issue where you have a Republicans are coming in and saying well we don't want to take away a pre existing conditions there affirmatively going out there and doing ads about pre existing conditions because\nDemocratic candidates have made it such an issue\nAnd it's it's resonating with voters\nIn ... Pam thanks a lot You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] state regulators in Arkansas have banned the use of a weed killer that's popular not just there but across the country this chemical often hurts other crops and wildlife but many farmers in Arkansas are defying the ban and the states having trouble enforcing it NPR's Dan Charles has the story\nThis year's confrontation actually started with a farming fiasco last year the company Monsanto which is now owned by mayor rolled out a new way to kill reads it don't farmers we've created some special new varieties of soybeans and caught and they can tolerate a weed killer called dicamba\nSo you can spray dot camera and the crops will be fine but you're weeds will die Terry Wohlers a member of the Arkansas state plant or kind of the pesticide police honestly I don't think anybody in the whole world\nDreamed that ... could create such an issue brings so many farmers against farmers\nThat gamut in stay where it belonged drifted across the landscape been injured millions of acres of regular crops it was especially bad in Arkansas farmers who sprayed dicamba loved it but Terry fuller and the state plant board decided the collateral damage was unacceptable I talk to them about it last year\nTrish ... known your neighbor and you're free and that's not my definition of good for business\nSo the plant for us the most dramatic limits on campus and the whole country no die Kemba spring during the growing season the summer I called hurtful or back see how it was going and he told me it was happening again thousands of acres of crops damaged also trees and people's yards this was not supposed to happen this year\nNot supposed to happen this year ... liquor is just been a sad situation and um you know really an unbelievable situation\nThe plant boards investigators tried to catch the outlaw farmers inspectors drove country roads looking for dying weeds that looked like they'd been sprayed with Ken Buck took samples tested them\nIn at least a couple of dozen cases they found the band chemical those farmers now face fines at least a thousand dollars possibly twenty five thousand dollars per violation I talked to a couple of those farmers and some of their supporters\nThey did not want me to record those interviews or use their names they told me spraying dicamba was a business decision some of them think Monsanto's dot camera tolerant seeds will give them a bigger harvest one said spraying dicamba is the only way to survive a couple of them said paying the fine is cheaper than fighting weeds any other way [noise]\nAnd by defying the band they're putting enormous pressure on the farmers who are farming\nBy the rules like taboo now\nPartially I don't believe in spraying dot camera I think it's too dangerous to spray I mean anybody that says otherwise is dreaming\nSo he didn't plant those new dot camera tolerant crops you got rid of weeds with other chemicals\nI use not one drop but ... says it can't be done it's a myth\nAnd then he solved the leaves of his soybean plants curling up that can bud blown in from some other farmers field\nDo I go out and try to which people and find out I'm not doing that but I have the legal right as a\nFarmer to keep a crop that is not damaged ... sprayed that legal right may not be enough though if other farmers insist on spraying dicamba he may have to also plant those new dot camera tolerant soybeans because they won't\nGet injured [noise] and then he'd be tempted to spray dot camera to\nDan Charles NPR News [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News and they see

U. T. senior editor Ben sell pot because today is Tuesday October knife\nBut that's not why you're here ... just got to say I covered I you're here because it is also the last day to register to vote and the November ... election\nNow thank goodness I thought you can ask me about Nikki Haley\nNo way that to NPR are going to talk about the auto racing here in Texas right now there is a link on our website at ... dot org I think it's called something like everything you need to know to register to vote by today's deadline so there's a lot of information there at K. U. T. dot org Ben Ben is here this morning\nTo answer some questions that we've been receiving from listeners about\nThe voter registration process of an accent\nAnd I think let's start just real quickly with the very basics on yeah so so what do you need to do to vote in the first thing you need to know is you need to do it pretty much in person by now to register to vote if you want to really be sure that your registration is going to go through the best way to do that\nIs to do it in person at a voter registration table\nA or go to your county clerk or your county elections office whatever county you're in and and do it there I'm here in Travis County or the uh the registrars office the county clerk's office not to be a tax assessed are collectors office that actually who runs the registration they're going to be out at\nAll thunder club subs at all Alamo draft houses are and of course they will have their office on airport boulevard open until midnight tonight for last minute registration so you can go there to get that done officially through county agents so\nThose are all places that you can go today to register to vote in person the head of the deadline at midnight tonight and maybe it just fair thing if you haven't registered by midnight tonight and you cannot boats you weren't they if\nYou are not a registered voter by the end of midnight tonight you will not be able to vote that is correct although that brings to an interesting question\nThey asked to yeah so one one of the questions that we've been receiving about voter registration what sort of has to do with timing and if I'm register before and I have to register again\nYeah we actually got a comment from someone saying you know remind people hey you don't have to register to vote if you were already registered to vote and you didn't move and that's absolutely right you know you've heard on the air\nOn K. U. T. in newspapers on TV are all over the place about register register register if you registered to vote\nTen years ago and you live in the exact same house and you have voted in regular life I mean if you register ten years ago and you haven't moved you're good you don't actually have to register again although we do suggest\nThat you go to vote Texas dot Gov which is the state's website click on the ... or click on the register to vote button and at the bottom of that page is a link to am I actually registered and when you click on that you can put in some information and it will let you know but again if you haven't moved you're registered it's okay\nSo it's not like your car registration your vehicle registration where you get her right mind during the mail and you have to do it again on a regular basis if you've done this year said but it's a good idea to go to the website and check to make sure that you have indeed registering\nI mean we had an incident here in Texas just I guess it was two years ago where the voter the motor voter registration thing that that the state had was not working for some people so all of a sudden people went to the polls and realized found out rather than they were not registered to vote\nSo you may think that you've done everything right you may have already been register you know for the last ten years but it's always good to go and check\nSo a couple of more questions than that we've received here's one I printed a voter registration form to change my party I sign the form and mailed it in as instructed how can I ensure my party with change\nYou can be assured that your party or has not changed because you don't have to register with the party here in the state of Texas\nSo in Texas that is not part of it is in other states but not in Texas\nNot in Texas now of course you do select what party primary you want to vote in but you don't have that\nOn the spot and when you're out on the spot you do not have to sign anything to change if you voted in the Republican primary two years ago you could vote in the Democratic primary back in March vice versa doesn't matter you don't have to make it official you just have to pick one\nAnd of course heading into the general election it doesn't matter whether you consider yourself any of the parties it is an open ballot that you pick a Republican Democrat libertarian or you know a independent candidates I'm just pick who you want better\nRight so bad and another question after today after today's voter registration deadline will you please cover how some registered voters who did not update their registration back over ninth might still be able to vote and I'm assuming update the registration means moved ...\nIf you um if you have changed your address but for whatever reason was not if you were not able to update that as long as you move with in the same county\nYou can go to the polls you sign up thing a an affidavit I Believe it is saying yes this is my new current address I you know I I promised that he is a you know you can even bring things like your current ah bills maybe for um\nA for your utilities if the new place but you you can find something that says yes this is my new address\nYes I promise I Lived there and uh and you can still\nWrite been now here's a request from a listener who says please stress that voters know their districts in other words to district they live and whether that's four states for the state legislature for Congress many otherwise smart folks don't know who to vote for I think the implication that simply because they're not sure\nWhat district they're living in and of course they're often city council just I mean there are tons of races on the ballot this fall that have us you know\nIn different district yes and of course one of the issues in Texas is that we have um you know partisan gerrymandering in the state uh\nCurrently does have a lot of I mean we we have I Believe it's five congressional districts that are coming out of Travis County better than ... shooting off into all other parts of the state", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "09"}
