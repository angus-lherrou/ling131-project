summer\nGovernor Jerry Brown declared that rich and poor like we'll be treated fairly he has long argued the bail system favors the wealthy and punish the poor\nTurns out that the story is more complicated now many of those who pushed hardest for bail reform saying the new system may be making the problem worse NPR's Eric Westervelt reports\nAlso in the downtown San Francisco public defender's office you might think attorney chase a boot dean would be excited about the recently signed California's Senate bill or sb ten which abolish is money bail in America's most populous state\nAfter all who dean and fill a public service lawyers of long called money bailing unconstitutional pillar of a biased system\nThe size of your bank account often determines who gets out of pre trial custody and the poor and people of color often end up on the losing end but this deputy public defender is not in a celebrate tore mood\nI was disappointed and I felt betrayed the new has to be ten doesn't actually change the race is system of mass incarceration just expand the new law was in response to it\nState court decision declaring that the cash bail system unconstitutionally denied people due process now under the new law takes effect next year instead of setting bail a judge will use a computer program as part of his or her determination whether a suspect is low medium or high risk for flight or to public safety\nWho didn't believe this will dramatically expand the number of people who will be detained pre trial\nHe points to one section in particular deep in the bill section Thirteen twenty that Eighteen a sub section five that section so broadly worded routine argues including compass anyone for any offense that he says will kill the power ever more into the hands of prosecutors police and judges\nUnder a speech and now prosecutors can seek detention for virtually any crime regardless of whether it's violent or involves weapons\nOr whether the person accused as a prior history under this law prosecutors have the discretion to seek preemptive detention of a person with no criminal record charged with a low level misdemeanor\nAnd then there's its impact on the deals currently across the U.S more than Ninety percent of criminal cases are settled in a plea deal that could include dismissal or a diversion program not a trial\nJohn rape playing with human rights watch says he's deeply concerned this bill simply replaces one course of tactic for another bail for pre trial detention that if he says to youth detention to pressure people of color and the poor to plead guilty to lesser crimes often regardless of their actual guilt\nThis is pervasive in the criminal justice system this happens every single day the new Dell reform law in California does not address that problem now you're just giving them a whole other mechanism to keep people in\nThe ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have race similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting an arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney ... says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain\nArrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color ... poor people worse or the various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't say\nSharif's fan over dean CEO of the nonprofit pre trial justice Institute admits the new law is far from perfect but she says some of these concerns are a bit alarmist bent over tea notes that discretion to detain or release pre trial has always reside with judges this\nNew law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nOh that makes it should All right I I don't think they shouldn't people needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which put out of business under the new law hopes to overturn it at the ballot box industry coalition is currently collecting signatures to try for a statewide

Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers like Comcast Time Warner\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim will is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nThey actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show\nOr good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I think that they are of decided they really want to have a a a\nEnvironment where are you know it's open for business I guess as their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues this is an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nOh I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that uh the the uh for broadband providers and California would have to listen to it\nAnd you know California is very large state\nBut you know about how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say is listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between which was the thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to\nControl everything and so I think that's a what a California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this kid says and dozens of other states are considering that mentality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new net neutrality love it you know it gets it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically filling up the federal government has abandoned the neutrality\nFor reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules for any Internet providers\nAnd other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where where much of the Internet was invented\nAnd so I think that that's what's at stake here is a really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note his is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is the dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word\nCalifornia law and the other hand\nIt's a question of the California go law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce phrase goes and so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or\nReally national or international and I think that it's a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on them\nI mean I I think almost all of them one they've all said they they like and neutrality law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT will try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans wanting to troll the laws that sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the ... the the broadband lobby and the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gap\nTim will professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things in the U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U.S\nIn her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages up which by the way have a positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a big departure for unions which have historically oppose trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\n[noise] sometimes the news can feel far off from your day to day on all things considered we cover national story on

in the November ... election you cannot vote if you are not registered at UT doubt or there was a headline called everything you need to note to register to vote by October night\nYou can click there to get more information and Katie's Ashley Lopez who covers Texas policy and politics for K. U. T. is here to answer some questions about voter registration good morning Ashley morning\nAll right so first of all I just want to walk through some very basic questions about registering to vote so actually first of all who is eligible to register to vote in Texas\nWell first you have to be a citizen of the United states of America to um if you are registering when you register you register for a within a county and it has to be the county and what you live\nThree you have to be at the time that you're registering you have to be at least Seventeen years old and ten months which means you'll be about Eighteen or older on election day that's important to be the right age and I see you cannot have been convicted of a felony\nSo what if I Can't remember if I'm registered maybe I registered twenty Thirty years ago is there a way to find out if I'm already registered\nYes the the state has a really helpful website where you plug in some information and data births driver's license stuff like that\nUm and it will let you know where you're registered like what exact address you have on file what county and all your other information it's important before every election to check that any way just to make sure it has your latest address and all the information is correct because it's better to deal with that before election day than when you get to the polls and you realize they have that information\nAnd we have links to all of this at K. U. T. dot org so you can find links to these Web sites there so actually really basic question how does somebody go about registering to vote in Texas I think the biggest question there is can we register online\nWell it is illegal in Texas to register to vote on line so know that the answer is very clearly no the way it goes if you have to have the way people say is like you have to have a wet signature and stamp on and on below in order to register to vote there is no way of getting around it and you have to make sure that you're sending that application to the right county which is a county where you live\nAnd K. U. T. dot org on this post we have addresses for those different offices where you can say that and actually I'm assuming I have not heard the phrase what signature before I'm assuming that means an actual pen to paper signature\nIt's just a nod to how old school our system is for registering to vote\nSo actually often has a lot of people moving in to the city there are people also moving around Texas even within off than people move around a lot so\nHelp us with this scenario somebody is registered to vote but they move they move neighborhoods and move to a different part of Austin they moved to a different county what are people supposed to do to update their registration so that they have their current address on it\nWell if you are going to have moved to a new place by October ninth sending a new application\n'em to update your voter registration now if you get to the polls and let's say you're in that gap where like you moved in those couple of days it's fine if your driver's license doesn't doesn't match and even if you are in that gap even if you move let's say two months ago and you haven't gotten around to it\nYou know the dry the driver's license is not there and your ideas not there to prove your address is there to prove you are who you say you are\nSo actually we've gotten some questions from listeners also about the voter registration process and I want to bring in a couple of those to you first about somebody asked how do I go about registering for absentee voting in Texas I live in El Paso but and currently working in Minnesota is that something that can be done on line\nYeah there is a forum on line up to the Texas secretary of state's office where you can register for an absentee ballot if you're going to be out of the county and what you are registered um during that time\nAnd here comes the question is about registration but also about registering by political party this listener wanted to know how do I find out if I registered as an independent but in Texas we don't register as a member of a specific political party\nYeah we got this question a lot because in other states you do register with the party so if you're new to Texas you probably don't know this but we don't register at it for parties here I'm that's why we have open primaries you can phone in whichever primary want\nUm it's a you know it's fairly unique some states states also conduct elections this way but I'm party registration is not going to be in that list of information when you look up whether you're registered or not\nSo you can check if you're registered but there will be no record that you're registered as a member of any particular party\nNow a political parties can pull information about like which parties you typically vote and for the primaries with but that's not something that's going to show up on your voter registration information\nActually been explaining that in Texas you can to register to vote on line you have to fill out a form that has to be mailed inner submitted in person so where can you get the form to do that\nWell online is the easiest way um gold tier counties website and they'll have a farm there for you but you know if you live in a place like Austin there's a lot of different places that are trying to help voters get registered because they do understand that this is a\nA tougher system that maybe in other states like I think it should be sometimes has drives or like different establishment around town actually a key to eat out or we have a long list of places\nThat are doing voter registration drives but if you don't want to wait to run across a voter registration form I say be proactive and go on line and ... and make sure you download it and then remember to mail it in\nThanks Ashley Ashley Lopez covers Texas politics and policy for K.

interviews and I know they've been interviewed before but not by FBI agent so that it will be a very thorough interview they have these people narrate and not provide them answers in the questions and better than the question\nOkay Chris sweat her former assistant director of the FBI thanks very much\nThank you Steve [noise]\nRight there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all fulltime part time and seasonal workers are going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means Hi Maggie money and just to note here Amazon is one of NPR's financial supporters filling out what other\nDetails can you share right so they should press release in here as he takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number as few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars in ... and so for the contract workers\nThat Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty ... it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about the Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers this is this change the result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about\nUm it's a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you counting all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders is on after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of just these are not just the wealthiest man uh in the world but the wealthiest man in history ... running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become an a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford the chain\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of\nUm you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere I should be scrutinized\nWe certainly hope that we're able to employ\nForward with an increase in the federal minimum wage\nWe also are hopeful other large employers to fall off and increase their minimum wages as well\nThis is NPR News\nFrom Washington with K U T News in Austin I'm Jennifer state in\nNeighborhoods across Austin will spin they're

I wore a pink shirt to work or I I held my girlfriend's purse while she ran into the bank\nOr I ordered a drink at a restaurant and when it came out to me it had a little cocktail umbrella in it and my you know my friends tease me so it's like it's just mundane things like women don't say oh I wore the wrong shirt\n\nWhy would men make such a big deal over trivial thing the familiar explanation is massage any or homophobia that is what buses talked to she began to think about the different messages that boys received from a very young age are you a real man or they say man up\nBoston built on this inside and conducted a series of research experiments into why men behave the way they do ...\nMy collaborators and I argue that the male gender role itself is kind of conceptualize as a more precarious status so manhood is something that hard to earn and easy to lose relative to womanhood\nManhood is something that's hard to learn and easy to\nMen feel are pink shirts and pushes because the defending something fragile\nIn terms of why this would be the case or why would you have one sex essentially have a more limited repertoire we'll have more policing around us boundaries or why do women take that femininity for granted in ways that men do not take their mascot handy for granted\nThat's a really hard question to answer but I think it has to do with um [noise]\nHow men their social status is more hierarchy Akeley organized than linens is\nSo men are kind of more interested in or motivated to attain social status and that kind of then translates into what we propose is kind of a chronic anxiety about their status and that translates into a concern about whether once seen as a real man or not\nMen worry about what other men was saying what women will think well they themselves might think Boston has some ideas on how to get more men into nursing she argues that the way to do it used to come up with a new set of stereotypes\nYou could spin nursing as a very masculine occupation it's dangerous to physically grueling our stereotype of the nurse you know you could modify that stereotype and turn nursing into a profession that does seem masculine or male appropriate [noise]\nSomething along these lines happened to Robert Vaughn when he was considering whether to become a nurse at twenty three he just finished for years in the navy\nHe wanted to go back to school his wife's dad had a suggestion\nMy father in law who's a respiratory therapist\nSaid hey you know you should really look into nursing von didn't immediately take his father in law's advice like a lot of guys I think the first thing that went through my head was well that's a\nA woman's job but von did get a job at a hospital working as a security guard and one day something happened that up to and has stereotypes about nursing\nWe had a couple guys who came in to the emergency room and they were just very belligerent fighting there's blood all over the place and the nurses in us and the sheriff's were holding them down and it's a dating and and restraining him on a man this is this is pretty cool [laughter] the actions of the nurses were saying\nWas pretty exciting for me\nYou know you think of nursing do you think of someone sitting at a\nBedside and being like let me hold your hand and and you see what it is realistically day to day\nAnd for me it was\nA hundred and eighty degrees\nWhen it comes to fighting stereotypes we often imagined that the right approach is to explain west\nOther types are wrong but Robin Williams live and Jennifer Boston's experiments suggest a different solution perhaps a more effective one\nStereotype some powerful because the stories we tell about ourselves how powerful the shape how we see the world and how the world sees us\nWe're only stories ... we can rewrite them\nShankar Vedantam NPR News\nShankar is the host of NPR's hidden brain podcast and radio show you can hear more research about masculinity on the latest episode [noise]\nSupport for hidden brain comes from zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution and one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing the count registration and more at zoom dot US\nComing up later today on all things considered freelance workers also called contingent workers the prize up to a third of the u._s. workforce by some estimates\nWill investigate them any financial challenges those workers face to listen to that story as your smart speaker to play NPR or your local member station by name we're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Jennifer state and and this is Austin's NPR station K. U. T. N. K. U. T. H.

U. T. Austin\nIs it normal in the background check like this to try to reconstruct events for more than Thirty years ago\nNo most background checks according to the manual go back Eighteen years so this is twice that time span that these are these spins usually go but it's it's not binding derogatory information is not unusual in the FBI has done thousands of these\nThe way to insulate themselves from being caught in the political storm is to do them the way they've always done them\nNow you just said the political storm how difficult would that be at this moment for the FBI when it's been under so much political pressure already\nUh it it it complicates things I mean for one thing that not to be be make a\nPolitical statement but the delay cause some complications because\nIf it had the complaint come in six weeks ago the FBI could have discreetly interviewed witnesses and been assured that they weren't getting details from the press and we're we're using their own independent recall as opposed to finding details in the press or having details are embedded in and reporters' questions\nLawyers and you're you're you're you're noting that Dianne Feinstein of California senator along with another lawmaker had a letter from Christine Blasey Ford back in July we think um but did not reveal it at first because of concerns about confidentiality\nA and that that is taking things out of order I'd like to ask just your guts sense I'm In the end would you expect in a few days for FBI agents to come up with conclusive proof that\nThat event did or did not happen in the early Nineteen eighties or in the end is it more likely that senators are just going to have to look at a little better information and make a good judgment\nI think it's that they're going to get a little better information maybe a lot better information but no conclusions will come out of it\nThey they don't make inclusions in these reports in that sense Joe Biden was correct they report the information they record any corroborating information that they have obtained or any contradicting information and then they they provide the report that the president who will share it with the Senate that's the way they've always done these and that's the way this one's going to be\nDone I guess people are being professionally question to the methodical way rather than hearing about one allegation than another allegation which is what's happening right now other media\nCorrect and the sequencing of the interview will be ... I Believe a Dr Ford and a Brett Kavanaugh will be the last to be interviewed they'll have as many answers in their hands as possible\nTo test out you know the details that will come out of those two interviews and I know they've been interviewed before but not by FBI agent so that it will be a very thorough interview they have these people narrate and not provide them answers and the questions and better than the question\nOkay Chris sweater former assistant director of the FBI thanks very much\nThank you Steve [noise]\nRight there was some big news out of one of the world's biggest companies today the Seattle based company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour and that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers are going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what does change means I mean I can mining and just to note here and it on his wanted in Paris and angel supporters filling out what other details can you share\nRight so they should press release in here as he takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically they issued a number as the months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year which is a very uh\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year on a topped one trillion dollars in ways and so for the contract\nIs that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is on it well\nI mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um is a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that uh the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with a if you're counting all the benefits and and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff basis came to speak in Washington a few weeks ago and I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical\nKind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man and history and running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um and they had a little science talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford the chain\nIt's I think that's part of it and you know\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleets of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of\nUm you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anymore she'd be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail um and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nMean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big us being in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working to gain congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge it's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um this is perfectly time for that\nCreates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment right during the holiday season All right great\nExplainer NPR business reporter Alina Selyukh for us on this announcement that Amazon is raising its minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour they so much Alina thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News and this is K

Internet service providers this weekend California passed a law making Internet providers\nTreat all websites the same no speeding up or slowing down access to certain sites within hours the Trump Administration announced that its suing California earlier this year the administration removed those standards at the federal level Tim Wu is with us now he's at Columbia Law professor\nAnd they actually coined the term net neutrality Tim welcome to the show or good morning why is this a priority for the department of justice net neutrality\nYou know I I think that that they are of decided they really want to have a a a environment where are you know it's open for business I guess is their argument and the other concern that California's meddling with a federal policies\nWell how effective is California's a position I mean the federal government argues is as an issue of interstate commerce so federal laws are more effective than state laws I mean don't they have a point the Internet doesn't exactly recognize state boundaries\nAre I think that well first of all California's law I think would be very effective in the sense that the ... the broadband providers and California would have to listen to it and you know California is very large state of how if you're asking their legal position I think it's a little bit of an open question what California is going to say\nIs listen they're not trying to regulate the whole Internet they're regulating how it's delivered ... and it's always delivered locally when you think about it um you know just between it's just the thing in your home and the word the local state that's all they care about they're not trying to control everything and so I think that's the ... uh California's argument will be\nWhat is the president this could sets and dozens of other states are considering net neutrality laws right\nIn fact dozens of other states have a new neutrality laws you know it gets it gets to a really fundamental policy question which is one of the states are sort of free to the experiment economically Phil and gaps\nThe federal government has abandoned the neutrality um for reasons known to themselves and they want that to be the rule for the whole union in other words we want there to be no rules or for any Internet providers\nAnd other states feel differently Internet's a sort of California where where much of the Internet was invented and so I think that that's what's at stake here is really the question the fundamental question of federalism and who gets to decide\nHow do you think this plays out in this particular skirmish in California we should note has is battling with the Trump Administration on a lot of fronts on immigration uh on on climate change this is the latest\nSo one thing I think that makes it hard for the Trump Administration is a California is legislating to a vacuum you know the Trump Administration says we don't want to have any rules in this area in California says we do you know we think this is is dangerous\nSo it's not a case where the Trump or the federal government is directly preempting that's the word the California law on the other hand it's a question of the California law goes so far that it really does regulate interstate commerce of fruit goes\nAnd so it's all a question of whether the Internet at some level is really local or really national or international and I think that is a very complicated technical question depends on how you see the delivery of Internet services\nWhere do you see uh the big Silicon Valley firms lining up on us\nI mean I think almost all of them one they've also they they like in the intro the law they don't like the idea that you know Comcast are already TNT we'll we'll try to charge them extra block their content know most people vast majority Americans wanted ... sort of the uh\nIt's a it's an audience of to the slow the it's the abroad been lobbying the Trump Administration like this law and so I'm not surprised how many states are are trying to fill the gaps\nTim Wu professor at Columbia Law school thanks so much for your time\nIt's been a pleasure how much besides the title is really changing of the north American free trade agreement\nOnce you prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker\nThat as President Trump's few experts say the new NAFTA resembles the old one although with some improvements NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nAmong other things in the U.S Mexico Canada agreement would encourage regional auto parts production open up Canadian dairy markets and set new rules for digital an intellectual property Celeste Drake analyzes trade and globalization for the AFL CIO the largest union in the U. S.\nAnd her view it could also address one big problem with NAFTA it would require Mexico to allow its workers to unionize\nThat would make a meaningful difference for workers in Mexico and their ability to organize and get their wages which by the way have positive benefit on American workers that Canadian workers because now there isn't such a huge wage differential\nThis is a departure for unions which have historically opposed trade deals in the past they argued globalized trade hurt their members interest by off shoring jobs so it's unusual to hear unions praising some facets of this new deal\nBut to be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nAnd unless strong labor and environmental standards are subject to swift and certain enforcement the outsourcing and race to the bottom and wages isn't going to stop\nShe likes the fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to sue the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach cries for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic drugs", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "02"}
