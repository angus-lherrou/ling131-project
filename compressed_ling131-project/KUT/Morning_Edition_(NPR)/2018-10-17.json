week against Harvard University and it's led by a conservative activist who has no past charge the College of efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move\nWasher with the New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line from order\nMorning how widespread use Asian American skepticism about anything that it's seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Americans still lower court or with action but the um the groups I talk to represent\nA growing and very vocal faction and our by social media powered by their own\nAnd diligent as organizers are quite in the fact that we can offer and actually\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action [noise] well\nThey they're very much into a kind of number I should mission or a or coach or admissions isn't actually often exercise in reality but\nAre they view the quote unquote penalty toward Asian students [noise] um in categories like personal renting a very subjective rank harbored offers as a disadvantage Asian American\nOr you say numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be we'd be all and end all\n[noise] yeah and some of the folks I talked to create a ... a because a lot of them are okay newer immigrants from mainland China or testing is very much a make or break way of social mobility or they do believe\nThat the test scores American um get food out for more than I Am shocked features like\nOr I'm I'm a personal ranking\nIs this debate any different if we move away from it all the university like Harvard to a lesser ... university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her ... what'll down to this question of Harvard because Harvard is an unusual one hundred years ago during um when we look at work\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people in American leaders are supportive of her adoption so that's really provide the you'd go into the issue at all\nNo okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh you'd as easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own reasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks that doctor would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before I'm waking up with it were grown so\nYou know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to all along could be able to partner with something someone like a ... gloom sort of serendipitous for both sides\nVery briefly what is it we're bloom the activists give them that they wouldn't otherwise have\nYou know I think he really has a long term vision he's been working a part of the uh the goldfish located in University of Texas Wild I K still going on he was already planning his next move so uh I think he's just as a level of strategy that they they didn't quite themselves\nWhile she was a staff writer at the New Yorker thanks very much for the time banks\nAre the CDC is

mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNow ... says given the rising cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery they do know that some kids who get it and also had viruses such as intro virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response on the arm or leg weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio and disease that have been almost completely eradicate it nothing ... pointed out that this does not polio\nRight now we know that polio

results now from the latest marketplace Edison research poll conducted at the end of September sixty percent of Americans think the economy is strong up from fifty three percent earlier this year\nThose feelings of optimism or greater among Republicans and Democrats and Rosen president of as more research is here to walk us through the numbers hey Larry good morning\nSo Larry we've been tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good\nVery good I Would say it's the lowest level of anxiety that we've gotten any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickled down to them any individual such that they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from a kind of miss and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tests that it will raise prices and hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly sub protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for goods but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by America campaigns things like that they might not actually follow through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things were all of a sudden their paycheck isn't going as far as they thought it was before\nAnd we also saw this kind of cause I hierarchy maybe in terms of the priorities people had when it comes to terrorists told me about that\nRight so we asked what's more important than different pairs\nAnd one pair we asked about was what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintain good relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies was more important than protecting us jobs\nOr by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods\nBut I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every country that means the ones that we are close to like Canada the western Europe et cetera [noise]\nRight Larry within president of Edison research things much thinks Tracey [noise]\nYou can

Inskeep\nAnd I knew well king good morning we're going to turn now to recent developments in the economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand and Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he\nCalled the said quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake\nIt's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David warning so the president has colorfully criticized the fed before but calling it the the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nI think it's very hard to argue that the fed has raised its restricts too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though unemployment is at a fifty year low and inflation is starting to creep up but I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go to fast the\nExpectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThese shoring deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements\nOf but one thing uh that jumped out this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not come up in at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot\nIs clearly supported by the facts of what the congressional budget office in other um uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that could happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nBut you're disturbing images ruined addict or a big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here\nDoes he have a link [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong it's Social Security Medicare and Medicaid or fifty\nPercent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages over the next decade are going to be retirement and health programs\nWe're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David\nYou're welcome this fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote\nGeorgia the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls and then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra open a member station WFSU ...\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be inside early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all sites within a county to be open from ... to ... pm during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites that selection\nEarly but he's very popular and guess county and and\nI Would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus\nAre this year he responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights in a state where a voter id redistricting on early voting rules have all been struck down by the courts at various points in the last few years\nDuring a June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos Quick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discouraged counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has been prefer and has been referred by a certain population and certain populations who's right to vote as not only been alive but has been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we set out with the issue to do is to be able to make you more reliable and dependable voters would

irony for many young people in the nineties it was cool\nNot to care about anything those who did were mocked one definition of nerd is just somebody who's really under something in the world of a new movie directed by Jonah Hill caring can mean you're not manly Rachel Martin has the story of a film about which he'll cares a lot\nJonah Hill didn't want his first directing project to be just anything he wanted a story that matter to him personally mid\nNineties isn't a story about his life per se but it is about the universal longing of a teenage kid who just wants to fit in\n[noise]\nThink you're pretty cool new good\nDiverse look\nIt's about a group of friends growing up in LA yes in the nineties and skateboarding is at the center of their universe Jonah Hill was determined to treat it with that kind of reference skateboarding\nHas always shown is like ... and like you know\nAnd it's offensive answer skateboarding is really sensitive even when they heard oh it was a kid from supervised going to make a skateboarding moving you know like some down that was the reaction oh yeah skateboarding is the most protective insular community which is why it's so difficult to make a film involving its butchered you know it's misunderstood imagine if there was like ten movies about NPR hosts\nAnd none of them have economic us right [laughter] that's my next door but none of them had ever set foot in a recording booze interviewed anybody you know what I Do\nIt's like any really proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beats him up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection\nStevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of a skate shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the kind of closeness you can see from ten thousand miles away it's sort of a idiosyncratic\nPerverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and on the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation\nDid you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends I did\nI've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film but I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's gonna be an Olympic sport for God's so mainstream but when I started the boarding it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the non judgmental mission in certain ways escape orders and I think that created a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really wasn't ethic anesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are still\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nAnd the point zero one percent were someone views the toxic masculinity or the homophobia as me thinking that's funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's\nThat is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history than to show it just as it was and let the audience see how ugly\nFeels our pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find it\nHow do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate\nI still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not a moral list I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel I think the way they speak about women and gay people is really a messed up way to go about that and then at the end of the film they still are there for one another\nSo I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them\nCan I ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribe [laughter] oh\nThat's really nice I mean the singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all and the kids along curly hair who's very like light in fun and funny at lunch I was you know all the kids would joke around talk trash and stuff and I saw he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nAnd you feel kind of big brother earlier protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his like rumbled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch you know and as a kid who had never thought about acting before\nWhich is so funny right because the guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything it's not cool to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I grew up in and what I Love about spending time with these kids now is that they are motivated and these kids give such naturalistic performances\nI and just so proud of them it's very moving you got the directing but now\nYou know my whole dream my whole life was to be a writer director I fell into this Fifteen your acting career where I got to learn from a lot of my heroes\nAnd it's something I wanted to do and would have done sooner [noise] it's just that you only get one chance to make your first film and I really wanted to wait till it was something that really meant something to me I Love this film I stand by it and\nI Hope to just keep making things that I care about that would be a great life I should be so lucky\nThe film is called mid nineties Jonah Hill is\nThanks so much for talking yeah it was a pleasure thanks for having [noise]\n\nMuch cared enough to them to MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm students\nAnd I'm Noel King and time

assemble thanks Peter Thanks Noel\nRepublicans have some reason to hope the Latino vote will not sink them in this fall's elections President Trump called Mexicans rapists was criticized for slow response to hurricane Puerto Rico and then separated migrant families at the border and there's little doubt that Democrats will win the Latino vote but\nBy how much some Republicans hope to do better than expected which could be good enough Senator Ted Cruz has some Latino support as he runs for re election in Texas and then there's Rick Scott a Florida the Republican governor is running for Senate in a state where the Latino vote is big NPR's Asma Khalid reports\nAlong a busy street in Orlando a group of Rick Scott supporters chanted known more now say in Spanish and they wave Puerto Rican flags\nBut just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing starts opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I Am endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping people avoid them\nBut even in endorsing now and the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend\nScott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans arriving after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses and through that all he's won over some skeptics\nMe the Betty honest with you I don't live in is that in the beginning that he was governor electing\nCarrying the as far as considers herself one hundred percent Democrat we first met him twenty Fifteen she despise Donald Trump back then and she still does but she says Rick Scott is no Donald Trump Scott has done a lot for Puerto Rico\nOr my input to go you know he'd do something good for me\nAnd so she plans to vote for Scott this November\nFor not MIT is a democratic pollster in Miami he says they are really two main strategies for any Republican to win Florida you either maximize the white vote or you chip away at the Hispanic vote\nPolling shows Nelson has the support of the majority of Latino voters that a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican ... and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that she was in a position to kind of deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is a concern of many Democrats because potentially could up and any plans to recapture that chamber\nBut a Monday says even those Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in the year where at least the political atmospheric conditions suggest that it's good to be a Democrat\nDemocrats insist the choice is clear when you look at policy but voters don't always pay attention to policy sometimes they pay attention to who reaches out\n... started very early in the year and it's been cooking for their eyes presence and the Spanish media will radio and TV\nThat's like listen to a lot of progressive for works I'm Puerto Rican outrage and the Orlando area he is not a fan of Scott and thinks the governor was disastrous on health care and housing but he admits Scott is running a clever campaign\nWhat he has done a good job of building a PR campaign to change from the little victories they may have had\nFor months Scott was bombarding the airwaves in Spanish and even the Scott previously raised millions of dollars for Donald Trump he now rent ads in Spanish and which he tries to distance himself from the president\nOne of the news doing their little relocate I see no reason to throw some Democrat he privately worry that Nelson ties with the Latino\nCommunity are not deep enough he's been in office for decades and during that time the Hispanic population has nearly tripled but now since campaign dismisses the criticism Amy McCotter that state lawmakers supporting Nelson says Scott might be more visible but that's not a reason to vote for it\nHonestly I don't think that's the most important thing the fact that you see somebody all the time doesn't make them effective it's what they're doing that I think the most important so actions speak louder than words\nMouse and says he's been busy with the Senate in Washington DC he points to his efforts to get hurricane relief fund for Puerto\nRico he's held dozens of

a New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian American skepticism about anything that it's seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian Americans still largely poor live action but the um the group that I talked to represent\nA growing very vocal faction and our by social media out by their own and diligent organizer it had quite an effect that lead in affecting ... ...\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action [noise] well\nThey they're very much into a kind of number I should mention a a a coach admission that isn't actually offered an exercise in reality but\nAre they view the quote unquote penalty tort Asian student I'm In category like the personal ranking a very subjective rank harbored offers ... ... pages Asian American\nAre you saying numbers based do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be they'd be all and end all\nYeah and I'm of the folk I talk to create a ... a because a lot of them are a newer immigrants from mainland China or acting is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count for more than I Am shocked features like\nLeadership or um personal ranking\nIs this debate any different if we move away from an elite university like Harvard to a lesser ... university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her ... what'll down to this question of Harvard because Harvard is an unusual institution here suggesting um\nWhen we look at work play\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people Asian American leader or a quarter of a kind of action so this really provide a you'd go at an issue at all\nNo okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own reasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks that talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before um linking up with that were grown so you\nKnow they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they want to do all along to be able to partner with something someone like Edgar gloom sort of serendipitous for both sides\nVery briefly what is it we're bloom the

tracking the country's economic anxiety since twenty Fifteen basically how people are feeling about their own personal economic situation and it looks like right now people are feeling pretty good very good I Would say it's the lowest\nOf anxiety that we've gotten in any of our surveys that we've been tracking since twenty Fifteen\nSo despite all of the headlines and attention paid to the ongoing trade war this is not really a big issue for people\nYou know some people definitely said trade was a very important issue to them but well behind other things like health care and immigration and so at least as of yet whatever problems or issues that the trade\nStories that are out there are causing seemingly hasn't trickle down to that many individual such as they're telling us it's affecting their lives\nYeah despite warnings from economists and critics of the president's trade policy that this is the downside to these tasks that it will raise prices that hurt consumers\nRight but we also asked a really interesting question which was we asked what's more important having generally low prices are protecting us jobs and people overwhelmingly set protecting us jobs was more important than lower prices\nBut I think the research would show that people say they're willing to pay higher prices for God's but when it comes to actually paying those higher prices in by America campaigns things like that they might not actually fall through\nExactly and so again this could be a case where it just takes a little while for people to understand the influence of these things

about that\nRight so we asked what's more important than different pairs and one pair we asked about what is what's more important are protecting us industries and jobs or maintaining good relationships with our allies and in this case people were much more likely to say keeping good relationships with our allies was more important to protecting us jobs\nA by comparison people said protecting us jobs was more important than maintaining low costs on on consumer goods but I also emphasize that you have to make sure use focusing on that word allies because that doesn't mean every

economy because there have been a lot of them the federal deficit grew to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year that's according to new numbers from the Treasury Department and it is a Seventeen percent jump from twenty Seventeen\nAnd President Trump went on Fox Business network yesterday where he said the U.S would start reducing spending but he also turned to a familiar complaint the Federal Reserve he\nCalled the fed quote his biggest enemy and said nominating Jerome Powell to lead it may have been a mistake it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to fish\nDavid Wessel is joining us now he's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and he contributes to the wall Street Journal morning David morning I said the president has colorfully criticize the fed before but calling their the Federal Reserve his biggest enemy is something new\nUm he's critique is it they're raising interest rates to aggressively does he have a point\nTo make it very hard to argue that the fed has raised interest rates too much so far after all the Fed's interest rates are around two percent pretty low even though on employment is it a fifty are low and inflation is starting to creep up\nBut I think there are people who argue that the fed is preparing to go to fast the expectations are they'll raise interest rates perhaps another in a percentage point twenty Nineteen\nAnd some people think that's more that's needed given that there's not much inflation and not much of a wage increase going on\nBehind the president appears to be in that camp let's turn to this uh this growing deficit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and some lawmakers immediately came out and blamed the Republican tax cuts here's a democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen tells you to budget committee hearing last month\nThe soaring deficits are\nHighly unusual given the fact that the economy has been growing for more than nine years when you look under this you find a number of elements\nOf but one thing uh that jumped out this most recent reporters that corporate tax receipts have fallen by thirty percent in the aftermath of the passage of the Republican tax bill\nI mean David advocates of these tax cuts said look they're going to pay for themselves because cutting business taxes spurs economic growth are we seeing that play out and and it is that argument wrong\nWell look the economy is growing pretty well but revenues total revenue have not come up at all so the case that the deficit grew because we cut taxes a lot is clearly supported by the facts it's what the congressional budget office and other uh uh you know arbiter say\nI think the case that I'm cutting taxes which for growth is untested because that argument really was a long run one that businesses would invest more of the economy will grow faster overtime and that would offset the cost of some or all of the tax cuts that's not something that can happen instantly\nAre at that that that argument may be jumping the gun at that Republicans though blame a government spending for the deficit Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking to Bloomberg TV yesterday\nIt was very disturbing it adrift ruined addict or a big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend over here\nDoes he have a point [noise] [noise] well I think that uh Seventy percent is wrong at Social Security Medicare and Medicaid are fifty\nPercent of the federal budget you have to throw in all benefits including farm benefits veterans and interest on the debt to get to Seventy percent but he does have a point we have a deficit because we spend more than we take in and the big drivers of government spending as a society ages\nOver the next decade are gonna be retirement and health programs\nWe're not going to fix the deficit without touching them in my opinion and without touching taxes at the same time\nDavid Wessel of the Brookings Institution thinks David You're welcome\nThis fall's election comes in several parts before the fight to win votes there was a fight over who is allowed to vote in Georgia or the Republican candidate for governor also heads the office that has been purging voter rolls\nAnd then there's the fight over how people may vote early voting starts today in North Carolina so popular that more than half of North Carolina votes were cast early in two thousand sixteen\nFor two thousand Eighteen lawmakers altered the rules in ways that could lower turnout here's Alexandra Olga member station WFSU\nTo prepare for early voting elections director Adam Reagan in Gaston county just north of Charlotte is testing voting machines by running sample ballot through them [noise]\nThese machines were meant to be in five early voting locations throughout the county but the new law requires all sites within a county to the open from ... to seven PM during the week and as a result Reagan can only open three sites this election\nEarly but he was very popular and gifts to county and and I would have loved to have more early voting locations it came down to having more locations you know helping more voters versus\nAre this year he responsibility to the county\nSome democratic lawmakers see this as another attack on voting rights and a state where a voter id redistricting on early voting rules have all been struck down by the court at various points in the last few years during a June debate about early voting democratic state representative Amos\nClick said the requirement that if one side is open on the weekend the rats also have to be could discourage counties from having any weekend hours\nWeekend early voting has them refer and has been for a certain population and certain religions who's right to vote is not only been alive it would've been rejected in a recent court decision\nHe's referring to black voters and appeals court ruled a twenty Thirteen lot that among other things caught early voting by a week targeted African Americans with quote surgical precision but Republicans who champion this law argue they're only trying to minimize confusion here state representative David Lewis also during the Jim debate\nWhat we set out would be in use you to do was to be able to make you more reliable and older voters would know the early voting site or soccer in their county was open ...

many young people in the nineties it was cool\nNot to care about anything those who did were mocked one definition of nerd is just somebody who's really under something in the world of a new movie directed by Jonah Hill caring can mean you're not manly Rachel Martin has the story of a film about which hill cares a lot\nJonah Hill didn't want his first directing project to be just anything he wanted a story that matter to him personally mid nineties isn't a story about his life per se but it is about the universal longing of a teenage kid who just wants to fit in\n[noise]\nThink you're pretty cool new good\nDiverse look\nIt's about a group of friends growing up in LA yes in the nineties and skateboarding is at the center of their universe Jonah Hill was determined to treat it with that kind of reference\nSkateboarding has always shown is like Cowabunga dude and like you know\nAnd it's offensive into skateboarding is really sensitive even when they heard oh it was a kid from Superbad is going to make a skateboarding movie you know like some down that was the reaction oh yeah skateboarding is the most protective insular community which is why it's so difficult to make a film involving its butchered you know it's misunderstood imagine if there was like ten movies about NPR hosts\nAnd none of them have economic us right [laughter] that's my next but none of them had ever set foot in a recording was interviewed anybody you know what I Am so it's like any\nReally proud subculture so that's the backdrop at the center of the story is a Thirteen year old named Stevie things are bad for him at home his brother beat them up he is lonely and looking for some kind of connection\nStevie sees this group of kids hanging out in front of a skate shop and instantly he feels close to their tribe it's the kind of\nCloseness you can see from ten thousand miles away it's sort of a idiosyncratic perverse closeness haired with a lot of toxic masculinity and\nOn the surface cruelty but such a deep connection and family situation did you have that did you have that group of skateboarding friends I did I've had it in many various ways whether it was skateboarding film\nBut I definitely felt like an outsider I definitely felt like I didn't belong and\nThere's a certain person that skateboarding draws ... you know skateboarding now is such a it's going to be the only big sport for God's so mainstream but when I started the boarding it was not cool and society really look down on you as a nuisance\nOne of the things I loved about it was the non judgmental and this in certain ways escape orders and I think that created a lens that I saw life through whether it was sense of humor musical taste cinema taste it really wasn't ethic an aesthetic for me that I carry with me to this day\nThere was something about maybe it's just me but it was the Potter of how the guys talk to each other and maybe that's universal like this is how adolescent boys are with each other they are still\nYeah and the only thing that's ever even come close it's been such a magical experience showing this film because it is my heart it is my heart and my soul\nThe point zero one percent or someone views the toxic masculinity or the homophobia as me thinking that funny right has been heartbreaking because\nIt was done so intentionally to hold a mirror up to how people in this generation grew up in the changes we're having to make in the wrong lessons we've learned to me they speak so aggressively about women and gay people that it's it's that is how it was and I felt it would be way more disrespectful to change history\nThan to show it just as it was and let the audience see how ugly feels\nOur pop culture critic here at NPR Linda Holmes said this about the film quote it felt like a salute to how toxic masculinity makes boys feel included which is true she writes but not sweet as he'll seems to find that\nHow do you respond to that\nI just disagree I found that it was connective tissue which is unfortunate\nI still think these people were there for each other even though they had a lot of behavior I don't think is cool the point of the movies that nothing's black or white I'm not a moral list I'm not here to like\nTell an audience how they should feel\nI think the way they speak about women and gay people is really a messed up way to go about that and then at the end of the film they still are there for one another\nSo I don't think anyone is purely good are purely bad I Hope to create complex characters that constantly are challenging what you think of them can\nI ask you about the casting because they're not a lot of names that people would perhaps recognize I mean the acting is pretty phenomenal especially the star the film and the guys who play the people in his boarding tribes [laughter] oh\nReally nice I mean the singular most moving experience in my life was casting first time are not actors\nAnd they became these people and became actors in art is one of the kids all in the ... with the long curly hair who's very like light and fun and funny at lunch I was you know all the kids were joke around talk trash and stuff and I thought he looked really offensive and that was abnormal\nAnd you feel kind of big brother leader protective over them so I was concerned and then I looked down and he had his like rumbled up script under the table and he was rehearsing his lines during lunch you know and as a kid who had never thought about acting before which is so funny right because\nThe guys the characters are playing are struggling to be perceived like they don't care about anything cycle to care\nIn the nineties especially it was the lame missing ever to say that you cared or tried at least in the culture I I

reason to hope the Latino vote will not sink them and this fall's elections President Trump called Mexicans rapists was criticized for a slow response to hurricane Puerto Rico and then separated migrant families at the border and there's little doubt that Democrats will win the Latino vote but\nBy how much some Republicans hope to do better than expected which could be good enough Senator Ted Cruz has some Latino support as he runs for re election in Texas and then there's Rick Scott a Florida the Republican governor is running for Senate in a state where the Latino vote is big NPR's Asma Khalid reports\nAlong a busy street heartland a group of Rick Scott supporters chanted known more now say in Spanish and may rape Puerto Rican flat\nBut just steps away the governor of Puerto Rico was backing Scott's opponent Bill Nelson\nI Am proud to say that I Am endorsing Bill Nelson for uh once I get in the U.S editor of Florida and helping the people of wisdom\nBut even in endorsing now and the governor of Puerto Rico described Rick Scott as a friend Scott has gone to Puerto Rico eight times in the last year he also created a welcome center at the Orlando Airport where Puerto Ricans arriving after Hurricane Maria could immediately get driver's licenses\nAnd through that all he's won over some skeptics\nMe the many honest with you I don't miss that in the beginning and his

a majority of Latino voters that a couple of surveys in August and September showed scot doing well with Puerto Rican ... and older Latinos\nAnd the fact that Scott was doing better than thirty five percent suggested that she was in a position to kind of deny Bill Nelson reelection which I think is a concern of many Democrats because potentially it could open any plans to recapture that chamber\nBut among the five even though Scott is trying to make inroads in the Latino community now since still has one big advantage\nHe happens to be on the ballot in the year where at least the

campaign\nWhat he had done a good job of building a PR campaign that sharing some of the loop\nVictories they may have had for months Scott was bombarding the airwaves in Spanish and even though Scott previously raised millions of dollars for Donald Trump ... ads in Spanish and which he tries to distance himself from the president\nOne of the ... the widow located in DC a reason to throw some

campaign dismisses the criticism Amy McCotter state lawmakers supporting Nelson says Scott might be more visible that's not a reason\nTo vote for it honestly I don't think that's the most important thing the fact that you see somebody all the time doesn't make them effective it's what they're doing that I think the most important so actions speak louder than words\nMouse and says he's been busy

a lawsuit is underway this week against Harvard University it is led by a conservative activist who has in the past to charge the College of efforts to balance their admissions discriminate against white students\nYet the Harvard suit alleges the university is unfair to Asian applicants and should be admitted even more than it does some Asian American groups support this move washer with a New Yorker has been talking with some of them is on the line can mourning\nMourning how widespread is Asian American skepticism about anything that is seen as affirmative action in schools\nYou know the data shows that Asian American still bar or affirmative action but the um the Greeks I talked to represent\nA growing and very vocal faction and our by social media out by their own and diligent organizer they'd had quite an effect that lead in affecting ... ...\nWhat what is the case that they make against affirmative action\n[noise] well they they are very much into a kind of number I should mention a a a coach or admission that isn't actually often exercise reality but\nAre they view the quote unquote penalty tort Asian students um in category like the personal ranking a very subjective rank harbored offers mhm as a kind of an aging Asian American\nOr you say numbers base to do you mean to say Asian Americans a lot of them do really well on tests and so they think the testing should be the be all and end all\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to create a ... a because a lot of them are a kind of knew were immigrants from mainland China or acting is very much a make or break way of\nSocial mobility or they do believe that the test scores that Asian Americans get should count her more than I Am shocked features like leadership for um personal rankings\nIs this debate any different if we move away from it all the university like Harvard to a less elite university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is unfortunately in a way that the debate around her neck faction has went all down to this question of Harvard because Harvard is an unusual institution as you're suggesting um when we look at work play\nA job hiring contracting a lot of people Asian American leader or a quarter of a heart attack so this really provide or you can go into the issue at all\nOkay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country\nI Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression that some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own reasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks that talked it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before I'm waking up with Edward Blum so\nYou know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they wanted to all along could be able to partner with something like ... gloom sort of serendipitous both sides\nVery
