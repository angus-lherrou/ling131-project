there will be big consequences\n[noise] it does indeed the report is based on a large body of scientific evidence that indicates that with each additional unit of warming the adverse consequences from that warming grow quite a bit\nWith the adverse consequences actually looked like\nThere are places where it will become more difficult to grow our crops\nBecome too hot and too dry there's places in
