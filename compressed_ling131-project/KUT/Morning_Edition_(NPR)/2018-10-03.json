{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Told from listening to Daniel Lipman from Politico or through a political play book what masses done you is how this will be headed by women who are going to vote in November ...\n[noise] yeah it's very ... very damaging for the Republican effort to keep\nA moderate Republican uh women voters from the suburbs to vote for them as they\nTry to save their majority a\nAnd it really seems to lock people who are victims of sexual assault a and that is a really for a Democrat or to a Democrat you got to take a huge advantage from this because they see they are going to play these clips in Republican or anti Republican hats\nOn I'm confused and it doesn't take much but I don't know when the FBI is going to report sometimes I'm told it's going to be friday but now it might be oh the oh they haven't spoken to dump to buzzy for to go into her loyal where we\nAre so they're supposed to actually wrap up the investigation today according to our sources um but\nIt could you know take until the end of the week because that's a reasonable reason that they were going to get given a week give us a and so Republican senators like Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins they really want to see that FBI report but unclear if it's actually going to be released public\nUm because we could have some sense an details from their investigation\nUh and Democrats are going to cry foul as it is reporting that they if I did not interview crucial witnesses like doctor for that almost seems like they weren't doing the investigation properly or the White House has tried to put handcuffs on the FBI\nOr as they pursue this investigation because they didn't want to jeopardize the chances of Calvin ought to get confirmed\nNow another story I just wanted to check with you Daniel and this is about the Trump family apparently according to New York times reporting avoiding millions of dollars of tax\nIn the Nineteen nineties or he is one of the reporters are saying that Trump's father Freda ah had written a lot of things down and they've got the documents for his uh his team have paid Mr Trump promoting himself as a self made billionaire might not be entirely accurate\nRecord shows back\nThat Donald Trump threw out its life deeply dependent upon his father's financial support starting from a trip and support continued lecture through adolescence and adulthood actually you\nKnow in his forties fifties with anywhere from five six seven million dollars a year from fathers financial empire\nDonald Trump says I build what I built um they were pages and pages of this report saying one bit that ah I noticed was uh apparently poker chips being both but never used the gambling that just as a way of getting money into one of the companies\nThat Donald Trump was running a again once the significance of this show the people who like Donald Trump well listen and those who don't like him will say well of course\nThat's always been the case\nUh with negative Trump is but I think the broader point is that the the New York state tax or is there going to investigate the civil already said that uh they wrote concerned by the New York times investigation because uh if it's true and you know there are times is the great paper then it shows that they were evading taxes\nOn a way that you are a lot a lot to do that and so a name the schemes are they used to basically cranked how much in taxes that they would have paid from uh we're supposed to be five hundred and fifty dollars\n... billion dollars of transfers are they\nOnly pay fifty million dollars is a link to iris a light gay under scrutiny and to try to investigate Trump as\nWell but it's tough when he was president ... tax returns\nAnd that you use the way to be a argues the weather boy I guess that's where the IRS the Revenue Service will have to make a judgment a if a evading is illegal avoiding just having these schemes isn't uh we'll see where that story goes Daniel ... thank you from political playbook\nLet's go back to our talk story the president of Indonesia visiting the city of ... devastated and the earthquake and tsunami James

McDonald testified yesterday Jason Van Dyke is accused of shooting the Seventeen year old sixteen times in what he says was self defense\n... towards me\nDo we know you're\nFrom Moore writes our ports crosses party\nAnd what what is Boston\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ in Chicago has been following the story Patrick good morning\nIt's MORNING okay so ... are just now I went back and watched this dashcam video again and again ... McDonald is not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shop that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes those very events are very differently [noise]\nYes he does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam\nVideo which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um ... you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was on the stand yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he served the dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his you know he describes his huge eyes and and his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke\nAnd then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him ... and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the desk and video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from what we have a video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense a requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer to borrow a for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that desk can video to show why he would reasonably be feared for his life like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the desk and video\nI guess that [noise] excuse me I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys\nIn court Russia watchers are the first two weeks of trial or do you think's going back I take the stand a what we heard were mixed answers we heard from a lot of attorneys who said um where you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify\nIf you're claiming self defense that's what's gonna bring it home from the jury we'd all sorts of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when\nLobster Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he describes shooting when he was being cross examine that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony\nWas contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports and I did not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video he was he was combat and prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid his initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements five on McDonald's the raising of the night raising the knife and and it describes officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonald none of those things are on the dashcam

just as that last year's version of the same meeting she has tried to get her party behind some plan for Brexit in just two weeks she is supposed to meet with the European Union leaders and find a new plan that they will accept\nNPR's Frank Langfitt is covering all of this Hi there Frank ... is this moment any more desperate than all the other times that conservatives have gotten to fail to agree\nWell at the time is running out as you point out I think that's what his creating a lot of tension here is there's not a lot of time left on an incredibly difficult and intricate negotiation of the problem for the prime minister has been\nShe can't cut the European Union to agree to replant and many people in her own party up there in Birmingham they don't agree with the plan either she didn't have a speech today a lot of it's going to be about domestic policy but she's she needs to appear strong and confident\nAs the country goes into what many stories would say is the biggest challenge making them has faced since World War two ah so that's she's going to be coming on actually very soon and we'll be hearing what she has to say\nWhat half her critics said\nWell she has a lot of critics but the probably the most prominent one is a man named Boris Johnson he's the former foreign minister\nHe's frankly seen as widely gunning for a ... job and he gave a big speech yesterday where he trashed her plan to leave the European Union she calls for one for more closer relationship with the youth still be able to trade goods seamlessly he\nCalled this a a cheat an outrage not what people voted for back in two thousand and sixteen he'd like to see a sharp break with the European Union a more independent independent Britain and and here's what he said yesterday\nIf we get it wrong army proceed with these on democratic solution\nIf you made in Hong Kong we will protect these\nTalks the tedious business toxic tedious business it certainly is toxic how does the prime minister respond to that well\nShe put him down gently uh yesterday on the on the TV she she said Boris and that's not how everybody refers to him he's a major figure here always puts on a good show one of her criticisms is that the plan that I'm Mr Johnson's putting out there\nUh she says doesn't really address the need to avoid a new heart border on the island of Ireland this is a huge issue we've been talking about right now as as you know Steve the borders seamless you can't even see it people and goods flow freely across in the Irish people in Ireland they they want it that way\nUm there's a real concern that it could change and she one of the reasons she's trying to continue to have good going back and forth with the EU is to avoid a border of any kind\nOf behind these details I have an image Frank Langfitt of an ocean liner I don't know maybe a the Titanic had imported iceberg and you've got several people jostling for control of the wheels Boris Johnson being one of them what if what rank and file conservative thinking this [noise] well\nI I think that for the moment I think they're going to stick with prime minister may it's it's sort of hard to imagine given the stakes here that they would switch horses in midstream and wall Mr Johnson is a very good performer in terms of speeches there there are concerns that he's not the right guy\nFor such a delicate time I was talking to a man named Anthony Martin he's the chairman of east Hampshire conservative association and here's how he put it yesterday in Birmingham\nHe would be great to have the big picture great inspiring people but he would need to have a long day and we can deal with a D so\nWould you want to see him as a feature Pam [noise] yes and no I'm undecided I Am a supporter of Laura ... but he he's a ... character you either love him all night and I'm ...\nCharacter as an expression here in the United kingdom Martin ... is this sticky dark brown foods bread and it's probably Britain's most divisive food products [laughter]\nWell suppose they get on the same page and come up with a plan is there any chance that the Europeans are going to accept the ... [noise]\nWell that's that's a very good question and we what was interesting to see it as we haven't seen a new plan they sent her back to the drawing board the leaders in Brussels and we're waiting to see what she's going to come up with negotiations right now seems stalled\nUm and we just got to meeting two weeks to go um and the concern is if they don't come up with a deal they could uh you take a crash out of the you could do a lot of damage to the economy here\nNPR's Frank Langfitt always a pleasure talking with his are happy to do it Steve\nThis afternoon at exactly to Eighteen eastern time you can expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one the station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the ...\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe share a good thing that the president might be using such a shift though for clinical purposes or get great diversion of the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure sure I I liked about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nDome is all things considered studying this afternoon at four o'clock\nAndy with us for the next installment of the K U T book club this Monday Night at seven at book people often other caring Olson will be there to discuss her political novel Waterloo set in Austin politics journalism love death Waterloo has it all it's the Katie book club Monday Night at\nSeven will for more information visit K.

us [noise]\nMorning we know a little more to say about President Trump's finances how here's wired much of his money from his father and how his world has changed\nThey says Austin's NPR station K. U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one on than we are online at K. U. T. died or\nNew York times reports Trump's father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in various ways to avoid some taxes but according to Forbes the president has tried and failed to profit from his presidents and I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the death toll continues\nAnd tsunami in Indonesia\nAnd the decades old back story of Americans from like\nAnd the newscasters coming up next\nAs you mentioned or by taking campaign money and putting it into his businesses are it's it's hard to believe it's all good tent there\nYou're reporting about his dropping net worth having to coincide with the New York times huge investigative piece about how Donald Trump got a lot of his wealth according to the times his father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to him in order to avoid taxes does that reflect what you found too\n[noise] yeah it does it does a ring a bell you know in Nineteen eighty two was the first year that we put together the for four hundred was of the richest people in America\nDonald Trump and his father were on it each of them was a two hundred million dollar fortune the next year they called us up and said well now it's actually all Donald tubes four hundred million dollars to Donald if you take\nThat two hundred million dollar difference in Nineteen eighty three adjusted for inflation up to today that's about five hundred million dollars for the times looking at the actual documents found that he had inherited four hundred and something million dollars from his father so it does seem consistent with what we've seen over the years\nThat Alexander was for thank you thank you\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces questions not only over accusations about his past but about the way he has defended himself\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nHim sworn testimony Kavanaugh spun out a conspiracy theory with no evidence saying among other things that the Clinton family was out to get it Jeff Flake one of the very few undecided senators told the Atlantic festival this week\nBut he's troubled and I don't myself you give a little leeway because of what he's done through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nHow important is this question Joe dashes vice president for Strategic engagement of the American Constitution Society which is a liberal legalized advocacy group mourning\nMourning can you really conclude the Kavanaugh would be unfair on the bench just because he says people are out together\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on a this past Thursday a ending with a phrase what ... what goes around comes around so I\n... for the future if there was a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out to get them they really don't want her to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone a sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they were black robes and they sit behind\nA lectern said literally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion but he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing anything\nWhat is the manner in which he could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense it if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it\nBut his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era where not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from ... in the courtroom\nThe judge would be shocked\nUm so I think uh you know there was a way for him to make his case and\nIn fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not\nOverly emotional and now it's somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if a Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats what do you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices recused themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he knew\nIt is to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving ...\nDo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerned about his temperament\nJob at

corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what

carefully to how it's being described\nBut with the sexual assault allegations against\nCatch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault

investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because\nAnybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned the song so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten and\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nCampbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying and doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus

trying to influence in Africa plans to build an entire new city in Morocco\nAnd the news is next\nProtests are kind of a way of life in the capital what we see them every day but the in the Capitol building it's all in one more in the office buildings that's around the capital but on the campus where the senators are that's just kind of the way things are but there have been near daily protests about Kavanaugh specifically and they had become confrontational\nAnd you know some Republican members on ... on the Judiciary Committee are now walking through public spaces escorted by Capitol police because there's a question about their safety\nBut I thought that they were instrumental in at least a portraying Jeff Flake is changing his mind after he was confronted by a protest\nYeah and so the protesters and the relationship between the protesters and the Senate and the capital has just become incredibly ... and it it actually brought the protesters went to some of these centers are flying into Washington in the airport\nAnd they some of them said they were really shaken about the way this conversation has ratcheted it up and what it's doing to the I'd like I said the political conversation about sexual assault and where that goes from\nHere All right NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell for us this morning thanks so much thinking\nThe Chicago police officer accused of murder wrangler Kwan McDonald testified yesterday Jason Van Dyke is accused of shooting the Seventeen year old sixteen times in what he says was self defense\n... towards me\nBe we've been knife\nFrom more rights side of words crosses\nAnd when he was\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ in Chicago\nHas been following the story Patrick mourning mourning okay so I just now I went back and watched\nThis dash cam video again and again ... not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shot that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes those very events are very differently\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um ... you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happen from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot about things that that he said the dashcam video can't see like McDonald's face and his\nAnd he describes his huge eyes and and his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonald turning toward him with and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical that does the fence I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the\nJury of his that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his wife like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right in and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Ross watchers through the first two weeks of trial or do you think the end I was going to take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify out top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWill have the cross examination go\nWell um when ... was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examine that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony\nWas contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nAnd directed not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nIt as initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements by requiring McDonald the wave of the knife raising the knife and and it described officer Van Dyke backpedaling from Guam and Donald none of those things are on the dashcam video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering this trial and his reporting among other

U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one on than we are on line at UT data\nAnd there are times reports Trump's father bottled him hundreds of millions of dollars in various ways to avoid some taxes had according to Forbes the president has tried and failed profit from his residence and I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin the death toll continues to rise\nQuake and nominate in Indonesia summer it out after that in early warning fail and the decades old back story of American like north\nAnd the news cast is coming up next line\nAs you mentioned or by taking campaign money and putting it into his business is uh it's it's hard to believe it's all good tent\nThere you're reporting about his dropping net worth happen to coincide with the New York times huge investigative piece about how Donald Trump got a lot of his wealth according to the times his father funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to him in order to avoid taxes does that reflect what you will sound too [noise]\nYeah it does it does a ring a bell you know in Nineteen eighty two was the first year that we put together the Fort four hundred lists of the richest people in America Donald Trump and his father were on it each of them with a two hundred million dollar fortune the next year they called us up and said well now it's actually all Donald since four hundred million dollars to Donald if you take\nThat two hundred million dollar difference in Nineteen eighty three adjusted for inflation up to today that's about five hundred million dollars to the times looking at the actual documents found that he had inherited four hundred and something million dollars from his father so it does seem consistent with what we've seen over the years\nThat Alexander was for thank you thank you\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces questions not only over accusations about its past but about the way he has defended himself\nWhole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political heck\nIn sworn testimony Kavanaugh spun out a conspiracy theory with no evidence saying among other things that the Clinton family was out to get it Jeff Flake one of the very few undecided senators told the Atlantic festival this week\nBut he's troubled and I\nDon't myself you give a little leeway because of what he's been through but on the other hand we can't have this on the court we simply can't\nHow important is this question drill dashes vice president for Strategic engagement at the American Constitution Society which is a liberal legalize advocacy group\nMourning mourning can you really conclude the Kavanaugh would be unfair on the bench just because he says people are out to get him\nI think there's a real concern there you know he spent the first week of his uh hearing for the Supreme Court nomination talking a lot about how judges should be neutral arbiters and calling balls and strikes and he went to great lengths to explain the importance of that\nAnd then he ended up on this past Thursday a ending with that phrase what ... what goes around comes around so I\nI ... for the future if there's a time when he says Democrats are up to get him he may have been hyperbolic but some Democrats are out to get them they really don't want it to be on the Supreme Court\nWell I think that's not really inappropriate role for a Supreme Court justice a candidate let alone is sitting judge to talk like that we expect judges in this country to be above the fray it's why they wear black robes and they sit behind a lectern said\nLiterally sit above the fray in a courtroom we don't expect judges to get down and dirty where politicians are I think it's bad enough to have senators yelling at each other we really don't expect judges to be politicians\nIf we except for the moment for the purposes of this question his assertion that he's innocent he says he didn't do anything or he doesn't remember doing a thing\nWhat is the manner in which you could have defended himself that would have left him on tainted\nI think it would be fine for him to be impassioned I understand it some basic level the defense say if you feel like you're being wrongly accused of something of course you're going to have passion about it\nBut his behavior on Thursday was frankly shocking in an era we are not very much a shocking anymore he interrupted senators he answered questions with questions\nUh it it was it was unprofessional and it was a very surprising to hear a judge speaking like that I don't think a judge would tolerate that from a lead again in the courtroom\nThe judge would be shocked um so I think um you know there was a way for him to make his case and\nIn fact I think Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not\nOverly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo if Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats whether you have to be recusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would filed motions to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I that I Do know that I Would make that argument that far but I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and over again and ...\nDo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society effect so much thank\nYou a new State Department

players end in violence in football if roughness weren't necessary there wouldn't be a penalty called unnecessary roughness\nBut the NFL has come to realize it must redefine its governing body of acceptable violence player health is no longer something to be taken lightly with the same time the NFL has rightly come to believe that for football to remain high scoring entertainment\nThose gun slinging quarterbacks need to be special we cared for clay Matthews would say coddled and successive weeks\nThe Green Bay Packers delivered hits on quarterbacks that would have earned the player praise from pop Warner level to the pros instead Matthews hits were met with appropriate the NFL said that Matthew tackles were violations because he had put quote most if not all of his body weight on the opponent\nWhich is to say the NFL seems to have to find an illegal tackle by defining the word tackle and then saying that you into the NFL had gone too far and was attempting to appreciate if we enforce rules that would've just soften are safe and the game but would confuse it\nAs societal acceptance of violence changes and it's our knowledge of head trauma expands sports obviously must change to\nThis change might come in fits and false starts in the NFL but there must be progress however Hercules jerky toward a set of rules that balances the old roughness with the new sensitivity\nThis last Sunday rough in the past or penalties dropped two two from thirty for the week prior\nI don't know if the true with turkey or the thirty four was jerky but it's an indication that the NFL is trying to get the balance right\nNFL tough guys of course like seeing fewer flags for crunching quarterbacks but diehards will always opposed softness they will even be more expensive version of acceptable violence and in the case of one specific thing glaring over correction they have a point\nBut the NFL's broader reach calibration no matter three weeks of excessive whistling there is still an existential challenge\nMike Pesca is nearly always turkey and his hosts the slate podcast the gist\nAll right stay with us now as we move ever so desperately from Pesca to painters one nineteenth century painter in particular named John that he's ... he's known for his love of landscape split ... also loved costumes now an exhibition at Washington's National Gallery focuses on the costumes and the women wearing now Here's NPR special correspondent Susan Stamberg\nHas shown that teased Camille cover oh\nMade thousands of landscapes he did them well and he did well by them by the Eighteen fifty she is a seriously successful nationally renowned landscape painter corrode didn't start painting figures women mostly until the last two decades of his life he died in Eighteen Seventy five\nAnd didn't exhibit them except to friends that his sociable studio\nHow come curator Mary Martin says the stick your work is a departure for ...\nIt's very proud of it has a very different emotional temperature than the landscapes it's a little bit and melon colic it's quite poetic it's very much about interior subjectivity and I think he just felt that it wouldn't players well\nNone of the women look very happy they said they stare they contemplate Mary Martin says it could be because ... made them feel so comfortable other artists expected personal services from their models as lovers mistresses prostitutes\nThat was not the case apparently and Colorado studio he was very gentle respectful kind\nThe models called him papa courtroom and Goodman lax with him show their true selves\nBeaming and smiling they're performing for the lens or the artist here relaxing this is what you look like\nTen sieve pondering he puts the women in various exotic costumes there was a family fascination with fabric ... mother was a famous melon or his father textile merchant\nIn the Eighteen Seventy painting Jewish woman of Algeria\nThe model was a bright red skirt and black velvet looking jacket lose was full graceful striped sleeves and embroider gold circles\nThe costume in North Africa of a Jewish bride I think it is a perfect piece of painting his Augustine us from Eighteen sixty six is an Italian country woman in a burgundy jumper guest Dina is imposing\nHer shoulders are so broad that these big arms no\nDaisy little thing standing there it's a well with her picture the top of her white under shirt peeking out kind of an nineteenth century Madonna the singer not diverge and\nYou know the erotic sort of a powerful woman\nThere is one real beauty in Eighteen seventies interrupted reading long earrings lovely bead necklaces full based skirt\nSitting thinking maybe about the book open in her left hand her head rests on the right hand and\nArm on arms again there he's changed her outfit to reveal more flash but it's modeled dabbled not nearly as worked over his face and the skirts looks unfinished you still sort of working it out but it's a ...\nFor him for him it's completed although as not completely a refined and finished in a contemporary academic way we're not beautiful skin it's not smooth\nSkin right it's not skin you left to touch it looks as if it needs a little body lives yeah [laughter] well yeah I Know he's left there's press strokes there yeah on purpose or maybe got bored\nWith that is a good job and I think it's enough\nFor him and this is of course is Eighteen Seventy is this is what impression ism is going to be in this becomes the conversation for the next Twenty years and he is starting curator Mary Martin says courtroom in his seventies is changing experimenting and entitled to paint as he pleases\nWhen you're an artist that lived as long as he's lived here in the twilight of your career and you're listening up and you're painting for yourself in a way and certainly not for the academy or for exhibition this is how we wanted to just like this\nPut due to the aging admired landscape

eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR I'm making a taco party\nThis is on point the closer we get to the mid term wider though the eyes of political observers in Texas because there's a bona fide competitive Senate race in the Lone Star state just a handful of points between Republican Senator Ted Cruz and democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke but if a war is writing a blue wave it\nCould still clash headlong into the towering\nRed wall of Texas politics however Texas demographics are changing rapidly so could that red and take on a slightly purple tinge\nOf next on point a close look\nAt the Texas Senate race\nAnd maybe a generation but on the other hand I mean ... is is part of the issue here that Senator Ted Cruz incumbent though he might be he's not the perfect Republican candidate right he has the likeability problem so if some other candidates the Republican were running would we even be talking about this race at all\nYou know I I hear this question a lot but I I feel like Ted Cruz is not like a bull in a national audience but he's likable in Texas um which is why he's kind of hanging in there so so well I'm you know why he still has an edge in the polls\nYou know this is a red state it's very religious having like a delicate right it's very organized here have you likable in Texas\nI see his campaign is just not being as strong like Ted Cruz didn't have you know there is the story and the local papers about how Ted Cruz's campaign hasn't even had lawn signs until somewhat recently to give out to people so it's just you know he he's doing you know it's been kind of active in Congress so there's that kind of pulling his attention away from the campaign\nUm you know I Would argue he probably has a little bit of election fatigue this man just ran for president not too long ago and he came in pretty close\nSo you know his campaign just doesn't have as much energy as federal works but he's still in a favorable standing in Texas you know this is a state that light that a lot of people like Ted Cruz that historically has like the people like this\nYeah well I Want to listen to a little bit of sound from a a debate that a congressman Beto O'Rourke and a Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nHad on September twenty second it was their first debate and a first if you're going to hear from overwork talking about what you were just mentioning actually about the nature of his he calls his grassroots campaign and he says that that's a movement that Texas voters want\nThey don't want somebody this job for corporations and political action committees and special interests because that's where Ted Cruz gets us money our campaign is the largest grassroots campaign the state has ever seen funded by people and only people in every single one of the counties affects every single day\nAnd here's Republican Senator Ted Cruz at that same debate a really criticizing O'Rourke for saying over and over again that Iraq has visited every county in the states\nCongressman O'Rourke doesn't seem to understand that representing Texas is not doing a photo often each county in Texas with reporters into\nWhat it really standing up and fighting for the people affected but I can tell you in six years I've represented Texas I hadn't been there on the ground\n[noise] so that's a that's a Republican Senator Ted Cruz at a debate with Beto O'Rourke on September twenty second uh Ashley Lopez but you know before we talk about sort of the deeper trends in Texas politics and in Texas demographics to\nActually ask give us a snapshot a little more of a snapshot of Beto O'Rourke I mean what is it that made him think that this would be a good year even to run against an incumbent Republican senator\nWell it's a good year for any Democrat to run for office right I'm like and I mentioned Democrats or more you know energize and they've been in a very long time but also you know we had an interesting election the presidential election here\nHillary Clinton came within a single digit of Donald Trump in Texas um that was nine points which is very surprising because Republicans have historically done a lot better Republicans running for president that is\nAnd so you know I think that was assigned to Democrats that things are changing um at least under a Trump Administration or the possible threat of at that point with a possible threat of Trump becoming president\nUm you know they were looking at you know this is possibly energizing racial minorities um you know and people young people people who typically don't vote and ... and especially don't vote in Texas so I think that that was the catalyst for that was that close or election and anyone was expecting and twenty sixteen okay\nWell you seem to Ashley Lopez she's senior reporter for K. U. T. joining us today from\nAustin, Texas actually standby for just second because I Want to bring in another voice into this conversation Brandon running house joins us now he's with us today from Houston he's political science professor at the University of Houston and co host of the Houston Public media ... political podcast called\nParty politics and he's also author of inside Texas politics power policy and personality\nOf the Lone Star state brand and running house welcome to on point\nThanks pregnant so I let me just get to kind of a fundamental question here that I Want to ... I Want to sort of um explorer through the course of this hour is this race um and the closeness of it between Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Beto O'Rourke\nIs it simply race it's emblematic of two thousand Eighteen and Democrats and the position they find themselves these would be the G O P and Donald Trump\nOr is there something deeper going on in Texas politics are we sort of seeing the beginnings of what might be um a demographically driven political change in the state\nI think that in some ways both are happening the Democrats like to say that the demographics our destiny and I think in large part that's right\nThe problem for them and part is that it's hard to bridal horse while you're writing it and the goal is for them to be able to try to invest now and harness these trends which I'm On paper would work for them but which in practice can be very difficult so\nDefinitely it's a case that the state is younger it has a changing suburbs that are much more demographically diverse than they were you've got a rising number of Latinos Asians especially in\nThe suburban counties which are breaking ports of Democrats but like you say to there's also a unique moment in American politics where Donald Trump is\nUniquely on popular in what is otherwise a really ruby red state so he has exposed\nThis risk within the Republican Party in Texas He is advocating for things like the border wall which has split many of the party's them but also many of the voters she has advocated for trade policies which potentially hurt rural Texas so there is still a lot of\nDispleasure with Donald Trump even though his approval rating remains fairly high within the Republican Party\nOkay so do your point though that if Democrats are looking at a at a demographic change and and pinning their hopes on that I Am seeing here that even though of course there's been a huge growth in the number of Latino residents in Texas that turnout among Latino voters has been consistently very low in the state\nThis is a big problem for Democrats they need to be able to harness this population to things were employed I think number one for when the case that the Latino vote is not uniform so it's clear that you're not going to be able to use the same message for each different Latino and that's something that\nIs common but in taxes because of the diversity within the Latino community that certainly the case\nBut it's also of course the case that I'm getting people to come vote for Democrats not so easy there's about sixty forty split so Republicans are pretty popular in Latino community\nYeah and and you know as Ted Cruz a cash just check me on this year but I'm reading that Ted Cruz talks about you know sort of the silent majority of Republicans in Texas and that those are the folks are going to go to the polls in November actually just got about Fifteen seconds before the break [noise]\nYeah I Know this happened to also be the voters that are more likely to come out and vote and have\nCome out to vote in Texas All right well we'll pick up this conversation when we come right back actually Lopez's joining us today she's senior reporter for K. U. T. K. U. T. and Brandon running houses with this is well his political science professor at the university\nOf Houston and we're talking about the race between Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Beto O'Rourke for Senate in Texas wrote one eight hundred and fourteen three eight to five five and eight hundred for two three talk I'm going to talk of already with his own point\nAnd this is that at one time special broadcast of NPR's on point here on K U T Ninety point five they talk about Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz and what the Texas Senate race means for the country thanks for tuning in this morning it's nine Nineteen\nSupport comes from Austin resource recovery universal recycling ordinance now requires all sued permitted businesses to have a plan for donating or composting food waste plans can be completed at Austin, Texas dot Gov slash you are oh\nSupport comes from the safe alliance with the belief that child abuse domestic violence sexual assault and sex trafficking are part of the same cycle of violence working with the central Texas community to stop abuse for everyone safe Austin daughter lord\nPatchy morning fog partly sunny skies ahead today high near Ninety degrees at Seventy eight in Austin at camp ...\nSupport comes from A M M collusion centers were locations all over central Texas A M M never requires an appointment Anglo comes military and first responders twenty five years locally family owned andme collusion dot com our reputation as no accident\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information that Colo guard test dot com\nAnd Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance on Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms\nAnd we're joined today by Ashley Lopez she's a senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas\nThere is a level of excitement that is just something I I don't even know how to wrap my head around\nRight so but you know how the ... the um the push back to uh\nThe analytical push back to a campaign that's run on hope is that hope is actually a policy right so what is what is federal work saying beyond this idea of a hope and reaching out and\nAnd inspiring voters who haven't felt like they've been heard before is he saying specific things about what he would want to do in Washington that are surprisingly resonating with Texans\nI mean it's generally pretty boilerplate national\nDemocratic policy and he's for the legalization of marijuana he is um that the packs not taking pac money as a super big deal [noise] um but what I think it's bigger than that as\nIf you want to see a work if you want to touch him he can he has a I think it's been sort of not appreciated this two hundred and fifty four county to her I'm from the city of Fort Worth which is basically the size of Washington DC\nIs completely ignored in Texas politics it's Dallas Houston Austin those are the only things that matter in our work is from El Paso which is as remote in Texas as you can possibly be it is closer to San Diego then Louisiana\nAnd so I think he's sort of has this way of making Texans feel relevant who aren't from these places and so\nThere is just um I compare it to when the ice cream truck comes to your neighborhood there's a level of excitement and doesn't really matter that the ice cream is terrible and the truck and you've got Blue Bell in your fridge you're just really excited to have the ice cream truck and knowledge or existence and so\nI I think part of it and he makes people feel a part of their campaign he will stand around for hours after these events and take selfies and then no selfies are posted on Facebook and so I Would say since\nLate spring there had not been a day that I've logged on when I didn't see someone I knew in Texas with a photo with that to our art\nHuh well let's take a little I just let me say this first that I'm making a chocolate party this is on point we've got another call here coming in from San Antonio let's go to Jerry who's on the line you're on the air Jerry\nOh there are just wanted to comment you know or if you're about Beethoven\nHe's different in these non partisan and not biased and not owned by corporations as the fact remains all politicians do include included they are biased and they are old and that's just the fact so\nTo me this this race is about the minorities getting that boat who's going to get to vote you know for myself\nYou know I'm tired of being portrayed as a racist the Republican which I Am I mean I'm not\nAn extremist or anything like that but I'm not racist allowed it to a lot of anti immigration and I'm not a big law structure just tired of about focusing on America for a while that's like a ghost cruises\n... Jerry you still there\nOh looks like last year but you're thank you for your call Brendan running house uh ... what are you hearing Jerry's voice there because I think he juries obviously not alone there might be a lot of energy on the side of federal rocks supporters but\nKnow Texas still is what it is and voted for Ted Cruz multiple times and and Jerry says it's I think what he was getting too was that he doesn't see this and so much about as about a better or worse because he does about people pushing back against Donald Trump\nI think that's probably right I think one of the things that Trump inspired and a lot of people and not just in Texas but abroad is that there's like a book the dissatisfaction with the current climate in Washington\nI think there's a real risk that that there hasn't been really any change to that and so it's difficult to be able to catch lightning in a bottle twice Ted Cruz ran the first time as somebody who was going to go and change Washington and hasn't done so so\nI think he might get a little backlash from that to\nAll the energy question just to brag on a hobby for a minute here she wrote a great article about yard signs in Texas New York times we're lagging indicator support but there's been a tremendous grassroots enthusiasm for what's happening for Beto O'Rourke the damage though the problem is that how she applied\nNo Democrat has won statewide since Nineteen Ninety four this was the first year that Frasier and friends were on the air so there's been a long time and you've got Republicans at\nThe state level who are Republican when their elections by upwards of twenty points to the same as we found in two thousand fourteen so\nThe Democrats have captured enthusiasm and\nThat's something that can be built on in the future because even if it was a fluke election and it's an unusual cycle where there's a lot of antipathy towards Washington like we heard from the caller\nIs definitely the case that historically that's been successful for a party in Nineteen sixty one Republicans elected John Tower to the Senate and although it was a fluke election because it was the sort of\nJungle primary was definitely the case though that they were able to parlay that into more resources back home they could recruit candidates and raise money those are all fundamental campaign thinks that Iraq\nCan help the party do what they desperately need right\nNow actually Lopez I'm I presume that you've been out on the stump with a with the candidates and I'm thinking oh ... or work as Abby Livingston\nSaid a a second or two ago that ... is is talking about actual policies um that are somewhat democratic boilerplate and if so could that ended up somewhat backfiring on him when it comes time\nFor folks to actually uh to cast their ballots [noise] um I guess we'll see\nRight he I mean this is a big question for Democrats after Hillary Clinton lots I heard\nA lot of you know Democrats wringing their hands about whether or not their candidates are too often focus on the details of policy versus inspiring people um and they think and you know I've heard some experts say that they think that might have hurt Hillary Clinton\nUm I mean if you think back at Obama he was sort of a mix of inspiration and sort of like boilerplate you know like like health care for example like ... like democratic\nPolicies um you know I Wonder if that's maybe helping instead of hurting um I mean that could be why younger voters or maybe really attracted to him because his campaign rallies aren't really very focused on\nDetails it's more about talking you know giving a narrative of how your life fits into his campaign I'm seeing he talks about expanding Medicaid in Texas at every event he goes to\nYeah and that's a big one in Texas because we have um the highest number of uninsured people in the country um and the highest rate so issues like health care is really important here\nRight and I'm sixty percent of Texans seem to support expanding Medicaid even as the attorney general Texas is doing a to basically under the Affordable CARE Act so maybe perhaps um some daylight there between Texas politician some of them and\nUh what some voters may want let's explore that more when we come back we're talking about the Texas Senate race race between incumbent Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Beto O'Rourke read one eight hundred for two three eight to five five and eight hundred for two three talk I'm making a jogger body doesn't on point and\nThey see as KU the Ninety point five ...
