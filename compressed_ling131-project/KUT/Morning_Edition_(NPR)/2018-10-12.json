David McGrath a Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder for me it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\n... ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had I known\nAnti bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for the bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can't ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean I I have dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm\nRacist by any means and I saw anything\nNothing like I I went to a majority black college it's one of the only white girls on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason we support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really hit you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nI think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white living in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divide in the country it looks more like a mid western state than its neighbors to the south or the east\nAnd sell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the\nTeacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants this is becoming a more diverse state has\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits are those the Hispanic population a and a uh eastern Kentucky a particle which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states how\nReal than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of on Donald Trump synthesis Frank that in that style ah I'm emphasizing conflict in ... often that's been racialized right quite often it addressed um toward immigrants and the ... has my immigrant\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that kind of cross\nIn this state um ah the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls from two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was eight oh was it ran a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet\nShe says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen

personal finance what do you think should each of us do the math and see if and how much we actually lost this week with any good come of that\nNo it's kind of fascinating you know stock surprise second by second you're home price varies day to day but you you certainly don't track it the way you attract the stock market [noise] most people are far too concerned about what happens yesterday and they're not concerned enough\nAbout what their portfolio is going to look like decades from now it's it's an ongoing issue it's part of the reason why we have such an underfunded retirement crisis\nYeah but you hear about these lightening fast algorithm is moving stocks around you think you're missing out if you're not fussing with your own portfolio\nEven all the more reason to if it's you versus the machine and all these MIT\nPHD's and computer programming what makes anybody think that\nThey're going to log on from their their phone with a little laptop and they'll be able to compete with those those folks listen I I I like football is next to this as much as the next person but I don't want to get on the field with these giant guys who were bigger stronger faster than me\nThey're professionals I stay out of their way we should really approach high frequency traders ... way\nBut I've been out on the street you're talking to people and you know the one metaphor I hear is that it's a little like an earthquake the earth shakes a bit and you wonder though is it a foreshock of the big one to come and you may be okay with what you lost this week but maybe it's time to take some money off the table is what some people have been suggesting\nWell since the bear market ended in March two thousand and nine we've seen twenty days where the S. and P. five hundred was down three percent and during every one of those days it feels like this is it this is the end have you taken money off the table on any of those\nPrior uh events you would've left a ton of upside there and then you run into the real significant problem which is why don't you sell how do you get back in people are very very bad\nAt objectively evaluating things like markets because it's red

regular White House press briefings were must see TV for a lot of people they commanded big ratings for the sparring sessions between the White House press secretary and the media\nBut in recent months those things have become less frequent to the point where calling them daily would not be accurate NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has the story\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders last locked up to the lectern in the White House press briefing room on October\nThird 'cause if everybody this year\nIt had been twenty three days since she last\nFree to press set out there and is\nThis

Martha joint Kumar is a political scientist who for years has sat in on the White House briefings pits in important forum for the public\nAnd we shouldn't let it go the number of briefings began declining in the spring falling below levels of the last two administrations at the same point in their president sees it dropped precipitously in the past\nTwo months briefings have also gotten

briefing say let's just go party\nBut he didn't instead he showed up in the briefing room and feel that the incoming\nIt just felt like it was a responsibility and you know sort of a democratic duty and\nNo one from the Trump White house would go on the record for this story and Sanders hadn't been to the lectern in eight days so there hasn't been a chance to ask the briefing but former press secretary Sean Spicer defense the White House\nThe idea that the briefing is to be all and end all and the standard bearer for the degree of accessibility is rather silly in this age\nAnd he argues that when the briefing became a rating sensation in the Trump Administration is\nIt's ... decree\nIt dynamic and the purpose of the briefing shifted from reporters using it to gather information to reporters using it to further their own personal careers and they were\nBefore the start of the Trump Administration to former press secretary McCurry and Ari Fleischer argued that to turn down the temperature that briefings shouldn't be live televised event that met with a lot of resistance from the press corps and didn't happen\nFleischer who was press secretary for George W.

Bush says regular briefings had value the press secretary isn't just speaking to the press Xi speaking to the whole world\nIt is a mutually beneficial thing for a daily briefing to take place\nMutually beneficial she says because taking questions forces the administration to hone its policy and message it's a kind of accountability Purina says she welcomes\nInternally when the cabinet or the staff knows that the press secretary has to got an answer questions from the press it can force decision making or consensus\nThat question how am I going to explain this to the press can be a powerful motivator parakeet NPR News\n\nAnd later this afternoon on all things considered a month ago there was a series of gas explosions in Massachusetts thousands of residents are still without gas service\nThe crews are working to replace pipelines but with temperatures expected to drop officials are also arranging alternative housing you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local member station by name\nThis is NPR News and this is K U T Ninety point by community supported by public radio from the University of Texas and as you and then and it's six Nineteen a hairstylist in\nWolf county Kentucky talks about why she supports President Trump\nI Do think in a business and economical way I think that he he has the right idea for America\nComing up we'll hear more from voters in one of the poorest\nCounties in the United states that's at six thirty for\nSupport comes from Senator ranch community in the hill country northwest of Austin offerings sixteen model homes were touring from twelve builders and twenty move in ready homes more than a reader ranch dot com\nSupport comes from Travis central appraisal district now thinking Travis County citizen to serve on the appraisal review board next summer online applications for these compensated position or do no later than October twenty more at apply A R B dot com [noise]\nYour central Texas forecast for today partly sunny skies with a high near eighty two degrees and tonight thirty percent chance of showers and thunderstorms with Lowes around sixty nine\nAnd for the weekend you're likely to see some rain there is a sixty percent chance of storms on Saturday with high stepping up to eighty one and Sunday that chance of rain shrinks to about forty percent it's sixty one degrees right now in ...\nThis is K U T Ninety point five\n[noise] he had no idea man be distorted something big perhaps the biggest in the world\nWhen I was working for those jobs are familiar you're closer to ... and he was struck to what his courage to pick it up to the to the trash can or what you're going to show it can I Am sure and that's how I started\nPreserving the legacy of ... that's ... this morning a tent on to UT [laughter] it's six Twenty one\nChinese exports to the U.S have at least temporarily defied forecasts they would weaken after being hit by punitive tariffs up to twenty five percent and the fight over American complaints about Beijing's technology policies\nSeptember mark the second straight record monthly trade surplus with the U.S according to analysts part of the reason is that producers have been rushing to fill orders before American ...\nThis is NPR News from Washington\nAnd we have ... news in Austin I'm Josephine flaky good morning or two billion dollar natural gas pipeline his plan to cut through Hayes and other surrounding counties can you choose to live Jones has more on the four hundred and thirty mile project\nThe proposed Permian highway pipeline will transport up to two billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from west Texas to the Houston area with connections to the U.S Gulf Coast and Mexico\nThe pipeline is being commissioned by Houston based company Kemper Morgan Texas pipeline and is expected to be built through the central Texas counties that have Caldwell Blanco into Gillespie\nAccording to the company the pipeline will help to increase natural gas production from the Permian Basin to areas along the Gulf Coast it's estimated that the project will create twenty five hundred local construction jobs as well as a teen ongoing positions\nThe company says they're still conducting civil and environmental surveys and reaching out to stakeholders construction is slated to begin next fall and be completed by late twenty twenty to Leah Jones K.

of the only white girl on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reasons to support President Trump because he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things things that aren't really is you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions of the state [noise]\nWell I think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state than its neighbors to the south or the east\nAnd sell to the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization\nFrom the African American and Latino community because they're small\nThere are communities here LCROSS we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with\nCentral American ah waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago was teaching English as a second language to immigrate to immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state as\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits Sosa Hispanic population a and a ah eastern Kentucky a article which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real then gives the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and there are multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter things all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in threat often not spin racialized right quite often it address um towards immigrants and the threat posed by immigrants\nBut there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um ah the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls and ... and they have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was a whole was ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population well\nLet's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and\nWe met her outside a farmer's market but she is help to get going near historic theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen does your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen and his congressional elections\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does\nThat marble fall dot org slash and that's and that's again that's marvel ... dot org slash and ... and [noise]\nYou're listening to community supported by the radio from the University of Texas is the Eighteen Ninety point five and they're on line and Katie's ... [noise]\n\nThink about it is ... is an amazing what do you think is arteries aren't really in any normally alarms go with your heart and we don't have any idea why lord\nIt's everything your mother hated about the way that you grew up I'm ...\nI'm Rebecca ... and this is the guys on your head today scooter culture\n\nAnybody who spent any time in Austin now knows that are almost on every street you will see somebody either riding a scooter or you will encounter a scooter that is parked or trip to the left or something\nAnd they're and they're listening to the voice from ...\nTo get off my lawn [laughter]\nAnd so there ... there are several\nIssues here that are interesting to think about when we think about shooter hygiene are not just what you do with the scooter when you're done with it but first of all the attractiveness of just being able to pick up this thing this just happens to be located at a place where you are\nAnd be able to hop on it and the go somewhere in it\nAnd then just leave it when you're done with it now there is sort of a a carefree attractiveness to the whole idea of that right I don't have to take your responsibility I don't know if that put fuel in it or not to recharge it got a credit card and I see one of these things and it's not occupied I got me some wheels it's it's\nEverything your mother hated about the way that you grew up except what you just take the toy when you want\nTo leave it wherever you want that we use it because it's convenient right now doesn't build any carrots [laughter]\nSo so but what's interesting about it is how\nBecause things are so available and so easy for people who might in other circumstances you like that they're responsible people seem to shed all sense of responsibility when\nIt comes to this thing I mean not only in terms of their personal safety you know the safety of other people when they're hardly down the street at Fifteen miles an hour with their protest reruns of cars and those kinds of things but also what they decide to do with the scooter when they're done did they put it someplace that's out of the way of history in traffic or\nDo they just cut up plop it down wherever they just mountain [laughter] and it remains there for some other people to deal with but I think what's particularly interesting about this is how something that suddenly introduced into an environment we have this other thing we're now our species\nHelp and confronted with this set of options that we didn't have before and how\nPeople different people respond to that because I'm sure\nOf course we don't notice them because they're not doing things of course introduce them there are many responsible scooter users who very carefully\nYou ride their scooters and park there scooters in a very responsible place but the fact that there is the opportunity to do things that are not necessarily a a considerate of the people with whom you shared environment\nSo so I'm going to back up when you know several years ago they they expanded the number of available a Internet addresses and and that led to the dawn of of what has become known as the Internet of things and\nAt the time people are like well what in the world is the Internet of things going to allow us to do things need Internet and and initially people were like oh yeah yeah because now your thermostat could be connected the Internet oh yeah that makes sense\nNow we we we've reached the point where we can also just leave things in the world\n[laughter] and and they know where they are because because because\nOf all these Internet connected devices young and so the scooters or a or a or a phenomenon related to bicycles and some other transportation devices in which companies basically are buying up a bunch of things like scooters dumping them living in a city creating an app\nWhere you can use the device if you pay a small amount of money when you when you use it the beauty of this is your pick it up where you find it\nYou use it while you're using it you leave it when you're done with it and then somebody else comes along and they get to use it yeah and so we've gone from thermostats\nTwo major Republican [laughter] in one\nSwoop up but his father was pointing out it creates this interesting opportunity to observe the development of social norms yes because we we actually\nUp until this point in the in in the United states Italy's private ownership of of things was the norm so the norm\nWas if you wanted a scooter to ride around you bought a scooter and it was yours and ownership means that you have control over who else gets to use it\nWe have this whole other\nA way of thinking about things which is we have these objects that that they belong to somebody else they are available\nTo use for a small fee by anyone who comes along and wants to pay that small fee to use and what this does is to create a different set of social norms which is a beautiful concept in some ways because it presumably leads to less waste but\nBecause it's so novel it creates this opportunity\nFor people to develop a set of norms about how to use them and and what we're seeing with this is that people are really suck [laughter]\nHe'll develop a bit of a norm\nYeah what you said about new things in an environment introducing opportunities for\nBehavior that's not practice than not learn and and Twitter is an example right I mean we've talked on preview shows about the idea that on created suddenly an opportunity for people to communicate with one another and vast numbers of people potentially\nWithout having any feedback about the reactions that they're getting from or the effects that they're causing all the people that they're broadcasting to\nNow no one was used to that because they were very few people in public life who could communicate across vast swaths of other human beings\nAre so effortlessly and and so cheaply I mean for free right it was nothing to it so ... what would happen is we we reverted to many of our baser instincts I mean many people describe\nView of behavior in a civilized society is learning how to tamp down\nWhat we've also talked about our previous shows is our short term attention to what kinds of things were going to respond to white respond to things in the very near future and long term consequences are not often on our minds unless we learned that they should be honorable\n[noise] next week we'll talk about political language grips with Dr ... and Dr ...

K. why our member station here\nIn Lexington we are in the sixth congressional district where tightly contested race will help decide control of the house President Trump campaigns and the district this weekend and those who will be in the audience include Allen halls the editor of a rural newspaper called the swift creek courier\nThat was actually a Trump voter was and I may vote for him again I'm going to read some of the same as we can or maybe I won't get shot\nHe leans conservative though he also says he prefers divided government checks and balances which makes his congressional vote tricky\nThis is a time of political ferment in Kentucky teachers staged protests this year against a Republican governors effort to cut teacher pensions and those waving signs and the state capital included Audrey law\nDid those protests cause some teachers to become more politically active than they would have oh heck\nYeah oh heck yes if I remember correctly it's more teachers running for state office didn't this year than ever before\nThose are some of the voters we've been meeting and now we'll talk over what we have found with Emily ball you a political scientist at the University of Kentucky and LCROSS journalism professor at the same University Good morning guys thanks for joining us early Al Cross how hard fought is this district between Eddie bar the incumbent David McGrath Democrat\nIt couldn't be any harder phone I mean it was almost like a Senate race in terms of the money that's being spent a the stakes that both parties see in it or it's just one for the book\nMoney being spent how much money are we talking about here\nWell Amy McGrath expects to have a million dollars and a a total\nPages ... is an amount that used to be huge for a Senate race just a few years ago yeah OK and Andy Barr also had I known\nAny bar will have a comparable amount and plus there's all the outside spending\nEmily bow you do you see that money being spent if you turn on the television or you drive around this district\nYou absolutely can in fact you hear it on the radio\nBitter bitter radio ads as well as television ads television I've seen tons of TV ads for the bars and restaurants\nAnd online ads to you can't ignore that\nAbsolutely not let's drill down in some of the divisions in this state and here a couple more voters one of them we spoke with is Laurie Graham she's in camped in Kentucky and wolf county a rural county she is the manager of a newly expanded Jim and she's a newcomer to the states she favors President Trump\nAnd she gave a lot of reasons why she favors his attitude she likes the economy and she also says she doesn't understand why people are talking about racial divisions in this country let's listen\nI played college basketball I went to the majority of black cool [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean I I haven't dated a black guy at one point in my life I'm\nRacist by any means and I saw anything\nNothing like I I went to a majority black college is one of the only white girls on the team\nAnd we all got along everybody got along great\nIs that kind of part of the reason you support President Trump 'cause he kinda as you see your calls BS and all this and you kind of agree with that\nKind of yeah [laughter] I just I feel like [noise]\nI don't I felt like a lot of people have made a few things that aren't really it's you\nKnow I Believe all year when we interview African Americans we hear a radically different perspective there how deep or the racial divisions in this day\nI think what's more important to recognize about this state is how overwhelmingly white it is right so it's about eighty four percent white living in this way that Kentucky sits at the intersection of a lot of divides in the country it looks more like a mid western state than its neighbors to the south or the east and sell\nTo the extent that there are racial divisions I think what you see more acutely is a is that feeling of marginalization from the African American and Latino community because they're small\nAlthough there are communities here across we ate in a in a Mexican restaurant with Central American or waiters in wolf county Kentucky the teacher we heard from a moment ago is teaching English as a second language to emigrate immigrants is just becoming a more diverse state has\nIt's becoming more diverse but it's slow you know the African American population is a a single digits or so the Hispanic population a and a uh eastern Kentucky a part of which is in this district is one of the widest places in the United states\nHow real than is the anxiety over race are you surprised at all to go to a very very white county as we did and your multiple people say I don't understand that this black lives matter thing is all about and they're actually actively bothered by\nIt to me this is again a reflection of um Donald Trump's emphasis right that in that style of I'm emphasizing conflict in track often not in racialized right quite often it\nAddressed um toward immigrants and the ... has my immigrant but there's there's definitely a racialized element to that across\nIn this state um ah the racial element has been bad for Democrats or you know the election of Barack Obama was a historic event but it was bad for the Democratic brands and Kentucky\nYou look at the exit polls from two thousand they we have about a Fifteen Percent acknowledged racist electorate will say I embrace no they said that race was eight oh was it ran into a reason for my vote\nAnd yeah there would have been some African Americans and that but very few because we've only got seven and a half percent black population\nWell let's hear from a person who identifies as mixed race and lives in a historically black neighborhood of Lexington on the east and April Taylor is her name she's a community activist on the east and we met her outside a farmer's market but she has helped to get going near\nHistoric theater there so she's very active politically active has strong opinions and yet she says she doesn't always vote let's listen\nDoes your vote matter in two thousand Eighteen and his congressional election\nI'm honestly not completely convinced that it does", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "12"}
