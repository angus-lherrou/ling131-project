{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "That's the economic argument even if the political argument would be let's keep all the popular stuff get rid of the stuff that people don't like so\nWe're talking about this with less than two weeks to go before the midterms are as as much as we can predict the future what would it mean if the houses and democratic control versus Republican control when it comes to bills being passed that deal with health care\nIf Democrats were to win and save the house and Republicans were to keep control of the Senate than a Democrats would at least be able to prevent the Republicans were making another run at repealing the Affordable CARE Act\nThey might also be able to use their oversight powers to discourage the administration from chipping away at the Affordable CARE Act although the White House would still have considerable leverage to make administrative changes in the law\nNow Democrats some Democrats on the left who have been calling to go further than the Affordable CARE Act and pass something like Medicare for all which Bernie Sanders has championed if they were to control just one chamber of course they wouldn't be able to do that but they might be able to make some noise about it\nDoesn't really want to jump in and also point out what Republicans are saying about health care of this year which is it's not just playing defense is not just pushing back on democratic ads I mean one third of Republican ads are about health care it's less than Democrats but it's still sizeable\nAnd what they're doing aside from playing defense is also attacking Democrats on Medicare for all saying you know my opponent so it's so and so is just too liberal she wants to or he wants to take away your Medicare as you know it take away your healthcare is you know what if you like your employer sponsored health care\nSo and so it's going to get rid of it if they vote for Medicare for all and and you can see that shaping the health care discussion not just this year but for years to come as more Democrats back that\nThere's a lot of fear mongering going on there we saw for example the president wrote an op ed for USA Today was widely criticized for factory factual inaccuracies in fact USA Today itself had to run a fact check for the following day\nBut it has long been a successful gambit for either party to play on the fears of Medicare recipients that the other party might try to go after your Medicare in particular because older people are very regular voters\nAnd if Republicans keep control can we expect more attempts to repeal Obamacare or do you think the current climate the waves his late politically the cycle would keep them from trying to do that\nI mean you can certainly imagine that there would be more attempts but then again I mean there's also given how fearful so many Americans have been about healthcare during this cycle especially about things like preexisting conditions\nI Wonder and I'm just guessing here 'cause who knows I Wonder if they might be a bit ginger about the specific provisions they might be attacking like preexisting conditions\nI think there are definitely some Republican activist who will want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced and the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda but Danielle is right there will also certainly be some wariness given the backlash they've gotten already\nAnd if for Republicans gained some seats in the Senate ah three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop or repeal effort like they did this year That's NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben thank you very much you could we would [noise]\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow so every week we focus on one race and we already talked about the Georgia governor's race in the show but here's the thing is just a week and a half left before election day a lot of big races to talk about\nSo this week we're going to add a second race of the week and to do that we've got to ... in our old NPR hate America pay there and we're gonna bring bread jasper's of member station ... in Phoenix hey Brad hey hey so dumb ethical let's start with you catch us up to speed who's running in this race why does it matter\nWell no matter who wins here the Arizona Senate races going to make history is elected eleven senators since becoming a state Nineteen twelve none of them though have been a woman and that's definitely going to change this November that because voters here will either elect democratic representative here since ...\nShe's a former social worker or Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally she's retired from the military with the rank of colonel and she was the first woman to fly in combat\nThis is for the seat that's being vacated by Jeff Flake who decided not to run again because he said he just couldn't see myself getting elected given on the Republican Party has gone one way and and he is gone the other way Brett what is the strategy that that makes Sally and send them are taking into this campaign what if they both been focusing on\nWell both of them have tried to re make themselves to some degree cinemas project of remaking has lasted many years she was in the state legislature in a very progressive member of that years ago and she's been one of the most moderate members of the house of representatives in Congress whereas like Sally\nAlso started off as a moderate congresswoman but in this campaign she's really embrace President Trump\nSeparate we could really say this for for most Senate races at this point in an election but this has gotten really\nNegative while we were in harm's way in uniforms cinema was protesting us anything to to\nMix seeds and things you can say whatever she wants as long as she shows picture of herself in uniform your show by just to get a link to show why about anything\nIn the midst of all this what are you hearing from the actual voters that you talk to\nPeople talk about the ads um they they are disgusted by them you know one particular voter you know it was really striking she didn't want to give me her name but she\nSaid that she drives two hours a day on her commute and she fears these ads on the radio\nOh my God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible honestly\nIt reminds me as petty school ground catty girl just going at each\nOther so I just prefer to distance myself from that\nSo you might not vote in that race because of that crack was talking to a a political scientist here who said she wasn't sure if that was a strategy by makes Sally but\nYou know the people who might be turned off from voting are people who are a less likely to vote in the first place and the women and so those might both be constituencies here since ... what meat so you know the negative ads are definitely having an effect especially if they're like irrelevant to you know important salient issues\nYou know people like to say that negative ads don't work in that they don't like negative ads but the thing is negative ads do work\nOr the fact of the matter is that cinema was leading in these polls her favorability ratings were much higher\nAnd there's a reason why she is now a started to to lose some ground and it's all because of those ads and by the way if anybody is annoyed with those ads and you're in the car listening to the radio what are you doing not listening to NPR [laughter]\nRight jasper's reporter with kj ... thanks so much for joining us thank you for having me and the minute
