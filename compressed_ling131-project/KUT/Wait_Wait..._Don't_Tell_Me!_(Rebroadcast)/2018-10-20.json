{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Dinner war mongers radically opposed to fight climate change their images of wildfires and people wearing masks do extreme\nTo Dana Rohrabacher so they're here you know it's this idea that these guys are not addressing climate change you got a you know voters are seeing it so both accordingly in the in the upcoming ...\nI see what you're saying I think the thing that politically makes it a difficult sell maybe um for some time is that you know Republicans are framing this as an economic issue we hear a lot of that deregulation and how'd you regulation\nHas has helped improve the economy and candidly the economy in doing pretty well by a lot of metrics right now so you you don't get it said that there's a real motivating factor for Republicans to see climate change is real tangible problem right now\nIt's the idea of like if it ain't broke don't fix it right but is anybody who owns a car you know if you don't you don't change oil when it eventually you're not going to have a car\nNow and that and I think that's the argument that Democrats would make this is an existential issue while there may be some economic harm to begin with you have to balance that against the economic harm that you're preventing\nAnd there were certainly be job creation with I mean we're seeing that with the solar industry right now with a reasonable energy\nRight yeah so you were talking a little bit of go about President Trump he is the party leader at this point and he has been extremely outspoken in his belief that\nThat climate change is not necessarily a mad may problem he has talked about pulling out of the Paris climate accord he sees that in fact it's one of his major achievements in office and he brings it up a lot at rallies that he sees it as a way to potentially get Republicans out and vote\nWe knocked out the Paris climate accord very very expensive job killing Paris climate accord\nJob killing terrorists flying\nA little bit more about what the Trump administration's approach to climate changes in the ministry approach to climate change is essentially that it doesn't really exist and President Trump he\nWas just pinned down on this and the sixty minutes interview and this was his first time as president before he was president he called it a hoax do\nYou still think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions intrusions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nDo we have a sense of you know really that the real tangible side effects of it\nSo the idea is by not pursuing climate change your protect these coal jobs even if you don't bring them all back\nBut then there's also this idea that if you make energy more expensive\nThan people will have to pay more companies that rely on a lot using a lot of energy will have to Jack up their prices it's like what you hear about the terrorists that they raise prices on consumer is basically the same thing that you'll raise prices on consumers and therefore customers will have to ... well\nYeah it's just an interesting thing though because I mean really what this is is it's it's a debate about\nI mean for sure if we were to address climate change tomorrow right let's just say that the Trump Administration somehow woke up tomorrow and said hey we actually think climate change Israel we want to do something about it in the short term for sure there would be job loss or it'd be economic loss just because you know that would require\nA complete change a mark on the way things work but\nWhen you look at the implications of not doing anything I mean it's hard to put a number on the future right it's hard to know exactly\nWhat the effects of climate change you're going to be and how much it would cost but I mean the research that has come out saying it's going to cost trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars parts of the country of parts of the world are going to be unlivable right so there are some really big issues that you're you're just kind of kicking down the road and at some point somebody's gonna have to pay that cost if we're not paying it right now\nSo let's talk a little bit about what is this difficulty at stake in the mid term right if Republicans keep Congress do we get a sense that anything would change things to kind of acts but I did that we've seen in terms of the Trump administration's um rejection of climate change into\nI mean yeah a lot of what you've seen right if you think about the Obama administration you could think about the Trump Administration is doing right now in terms of environmental policy almost everything that's happening is in the executive branch right Congress has not they're not really doing anything that haven't for a long time when it comes to the environment\nToday on the flip side than if Democrats\nAre who do seem to see this as a pressing issue right now right politically you are hearing Democrats talk a little bit more about climate change and some of the threats they hear from the Republican opponent so if Democrats were to take control even if one chamber of the house I mean what could they do too I mean beyond say oversight\nThat's about it every Democrat I talked to said oversight oversight oversight which ... you know we shouldn't be what does that mean exactly are you hearing you know expect to see Ryan Zinke key\nUh Andrew wheeler the head of the EPA runs it could be in the head of the interior um you know you would expect to see those guys on hearings over and over and over again where they'd be having to come up and explain a lot of the roll back to their doing explained why they\nGot rid of the mess and ruled explain you know the spending cuts for climate science at NASA or those sort of things where it makes it very difficult for them do their jobs because they're basically having to spend all their time preparing for hearing some took a potentially slowed down the process you're saying yeah could slow down the process you know there was another interesting thing that uh\nYou know Tom pile who is with the American energy alliance very supportive of Trump's agenda he said it would actually also give Democrats an environmental groups of stage to craft a narrative that\nThat hasn't really gotten out there right now against what Trump is doing with the environment um which I thought was really interesting you said there's just so much other news happening that environment issues really haven't you know taken center stage um and it would give them an opportunity to actually really to craft that narrative and put it out there\nThat's basically what the Republicans did on climate change under President Obama when they took over the house they would be bringing in a you know the EPA administrators and others and basically kinda yell at them and say you're going to put a tax on all these weird heard all these people they were they use that to frame their narrative and make ... any climate change\nAction seem like it is a tax and it's going to hurt people\nAlright well thank you both
