{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "The junior senator saw it in Texas cruise early on one of his you know his strongest speaking points was with what I think about immigration I can sum up and forwards\nLegal good illegal bad\nWell Republicans really think this is going to work with their base voters the question is is this an important enough issue that it's going to make a difference with voters that they need to get they can't just when these races with their base alone\nThis is the politics you from NPR I'm Scott Detrow my co host ... is talking to NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson about immigration and how big of a rural it's going to play in the midterms\nMy isn't that the argument to be made I was speaking with Whit Ayres geo people start some months ago about this issue of immigration and he made the argument that let me terms are different right these battles are going to be fought in sort of swing suburban districts\nYes it it plays differently in different races\nBut then of course you have the the unexpected effect or perhaps of\nSo let's say you follow through with this and all these immigration enforcement policies continue and there are fewer and fewer undocumented immigrants in the country to do the jobs that they have a hard time hiring Americans to do so now we have contractors in Houston we have growers in\nUh Southern California and they're all screaming for workers because they cannot get enough people to do the work and this is also you know a lot of the constituency of the G O P and\nThis labor shortage for these really tough jobs is is coming\nAnd it's only going to get worse\nIt's really hard to have these conversations about immigrants for not talking about turnout among those like Tina voters an Asian American voters who fits jointly at them as the the worst voter turnout is not just in general elections but in mid term elections and\nI was just looking at some data from the NBC News Wall Street journal most recent poll they looked at enthusiasm essential your interest in the midterms and let you knows when you're at the bottom of all demographic ribs right I mean I think they were slightly above young voters and whatnot but the but the enthusiasm isn't there\nYet to me this is one of the biggest mysteries of the twenty Eighteen election cycle you had this huge burst of activism among the DACA kids they were fearless they were potentially open to deportation if their DACA protections were stripped away but they were going out in public\nThey were leading protests they were inspiring to a lot of Hispanics who weren't who were perfectly legal but generally didn't want to get involved but you still see this\nLack of increased registration levels among Hispanic voters why the Democratic party hasn't made a bigger push or why would ever push they have made hasn't had more success if Hispanic voters can't get energized in the Trump era I don't know when they ever would\nBe there is a young woman I met in Las Vegas a she's a college student her name is Norma ... and I talked to her about voting and what she thinks about President Trump\nYou know with President Trump I personally felt attacked because he had stuff to say about\nMexicans and on and so that kind of played a very bad taste in my mouth\nSo I asked you know did you vote twenty sixteen no she didn't do and I asked him do you intend to vote in the mid ... probably not\nAnd you just happened to pick somebody to interview who's a member of the two demographic groups that turn out the least young people and Hispanics and this is a year where we're going to test the theory that there are a lot of reasons for young people\nEspecially round all those school shootings to turn out there are a lot of reasons for Hispanics to be energized and turn out and now we're going to find out if they actually do\nThat with my co host ... and NPR's Mara Liasson and John Burnett is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow\n\nAnd this is the part of the show where we talk about the things political or otherwise that we just can't let go of that you\nDon't hear by NPR's Ayesha Rascoe and Danielle Kurtzleben hey guys hello\nHey poke at throughout all the news that have happened the last week this one thing has kept me sane and I've gone back to it in my mind over and over again I'm going to start this way picture in your mind Dick Chaney [laughter]\nKeep going if you were to make a bio pic of Dick Cheney who would you cast in that role\nJohn Goodman and John Goodman and very good but he doesn't look like them but he could be ... yeah yeah\nRight if it was I'm gonna blow your mind okay there is a Dick Cheney bio pic coming this winter and do you know who's playing Dick Cheney who go Christian Bale\nBatman Batman site when\nDick Cheney I think Batman\nBatman and the like vigilante like Batman voice that he uses you can hear that translating into the Dick Cheney kind of a rumble growl\nBut no so this is a new movie it's called the vice it is it like a comedy it's a drama tea and it's a Adam McKay it's a whole group from the big short a Christian Bale is Dick Cheney Amy Adams is Lynne Cheney Steve\nCorral is Donald Rumsfeld there is a lot going on I Want you to be ... be that is a very George W. Bush vice versa Georgia and Christian Bale has gained all the weight you have but residents say mostly Somali job he gained weight in my suit\nHe gained like twenty or thirty pounds he apparently seek grill said Christian Bale did exercise is to make his neck bigger they\nOnly method I almost\nMore excited about the co stars than I Am about Christian Bale as Dick Cheney which which itself you know I just live ... I just wanted to say something like Iraq needs me or [laughter]\nIs Donald Rumsfeld and also I'm Sam Rockwell is W. as what's really going about this that's inspired which\nLeads to the question you can spend a lot of time thinking about it how would you cast a Trump Administration movie\nI'm Russell Crowe would play Steve man and I have thought about that hard I think Russell Crowe and make an amazing Steve Bannon that ... that would work\nIf you have any ideas on that you can send them to buy hot [laughter] it is yeah [noise]\nAnd that that is clearly the thing we can't let go of this week\nThis is the politics show from NPR we are here every weekend with a special broadcast leading up to the mid term election where we break down all the major themes issues and raise is playing out this year the news keeps happening all week all weekend long when it happens we do a podcast on it the NPR politics podcast is out every time there's big news\nCan find that wherever you get your potash I'm Scott Detrow covers Congress and Daniel ... political reporter and mice and rats I covered the White House and our show is produced by Barton gurdwara barbers front and clearly Weiner our editors Donovan surely\nHenry andme sonics hurry with support from here for ... thank you for listening to the politics show from NPR [noise]\nFrom the K U T public media studios you're listening to UT and K.
