Senate race that's the Democrat running and came out against it that the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nWas incredibly notable because she has been extraordinarily apolitical and a lot of people were wondering in the twenty sixteen election why she didn't chime in and you know and I have my own theories about you know do we really need singers are actors or sports stars to be\nPolitical but pretty much like everybody else weight in I mean Katy Perry fiance everybody was like doing concerts for Hillary\nAnd Taylor Swift was silent I think a lot of people assume maybe she was a Republican even\nAnd you know there's been some let's say series that after she posted this on Instagram she has over a hundred million followers on Instagram that that there was some sort of taken voter registration you know we can debate whether or not that is entirely true or registration always sees an up tick just a couple of days before the deadline\nBut I mean look at the end of the day there is some indication that they're that a lot of young people were registering they let these last couple of days and and I must\nBelief that Taylor Swift who is noticeably been very quiet if you suddenly start seeing somebody who you are a big fan of post about it it might have made some people will be considered\nYeah I mean I'm sure she got some people to register I'm sure there are some young voters in Tennessee who maybe weren't paying attention to the race who now suddenly were but I mean ascribing any kind of real political power to a celebrity endorsement always makes me a little queasy and I you know kind of\nDon't necessarily think that there's a huge influence from that person and and sometimes they can really backfire frankly I mean\nI Know that brought us and embraced this endorsement but at the same time her endorsement was kind of a pretty part is an endorsement you had to do with ... writes for example um I'm not so sure for someone like Brett is and that's the whole message that he wants to embrace because\nHe is running as a pretty nonpartisan guy there's a lot of people in Tennessee you don't even know Bredesen is a Democrat he was governor there and uh you know putting a celebrity or as a face of as part of your campaign essentially you know that can be polarizing for a lot of people who may not have even realize that\nYou were a Democrat in the first place\nFor younger voters eh LGBTQ rights is not really a partisan issue in the way when I was\nTalking about the younger voters necessarily right I mean we're talking about Tennessee you know middle of the road a older voters the kinds of people who actually do vote in elections\nBut there is some talk that younger people are showing enthusiasm level that are not traditionally what we see in the midterm elections so they might surprise us all [laughter]\nAll we can say is that there's some bad blood between ... and look at it as maybe Marsha Blackburn just wants to shake it off really telling them that that was pretty mediocre but it's all I got four is less than New York everyone [laughter]\nI'm done [laughter]\nAnd this whole thing was voted no oh my God [laughter]\n[noise]\nOkay those were the things that we can't let go of we'll continue this conversation about Taylor Swift off line\nThis is the politics show from NPR and we're here every weekend with a special broadcast leading up to the mid term elections will be breaking down the major themes issues and race is playing out this year and as the news keeps happening all week long you can keep up with our pod cast the NPR politics podcast\nTo get the inside scoop on the biggest political stories right as they happen I'm ...
