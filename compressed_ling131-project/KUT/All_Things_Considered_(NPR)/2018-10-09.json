busy morning at the camp single un un relief and works agency on raw has been preaching education and in some cases feeding refugees since Nineteen forty nine but the Trump Administration doesn't like it [noise]\nWhen I began it was dealing with around seven hundred and fifty thousand refugees people who fled oil like saline were driven from their homes in the fighting that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight\nAround forty thousand of those original refugees are still alive according to the un day and that descendents now number around five million\nWhen rouse director in Lebanon is cloudy our core donor\nOr does not inflate to the number of refugees artificial refugees is in fact in line with a general understanding of what is a refugee in the world unfortunately it looks like we're being brought into a the politics of the middle east and what bearing the brunt\nOf political decisions that have very little to do with our humanitarian mission\nThey stop funding on reform unreal an organization that instead of solving the Palestinian refugee problem for ...\nAt the U.N General assembly Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu set up ready to the Trump administration's decision to count all funding to on raw slashing his budget by about a third\nOf the donors have come to the rescue but along with the Trump administration's other moves this year it feels like part of an effort to weaken the Palestinians softening them up perhaps before unveiling the deal at the century\nIs so clear that that he can walk to adjust to

the urgency of dealing with global warming a cool in the Netherlands has added some legal to that message the appeals court upheld the ruining in a case brought by an environmental lobbying group called agenda it commits the Dutch government to reducing carbon emissions\n[noise] well that's the administration's view or you know miss Haley has been faithful\nTo the administration's position what's your view my own view is that there were flaws in the ... agreement negotiated by the previous administration particularly allowing Iran to a resume certain activities like a missile testing and stuff like that after a certain number of years\nAnd I think the fiery days has always bothered people but probably what bothered this administration more than anything else and it is a troublesome\nFactor is that the the agreement didn't do anything to curtail Iran the aggressive behavior throughout the region\nHow would you assess Nikki Haley's time at the un has she been successful in advancing U.S foreign policy goals\nI think as defined by the president of the United states and the current administration yes that'd be my first point the second\nIs I think she was very well suited for the job she's an outgoing politician there's quite a political aspect to being ambassador to the United nations you gotta go schmooze with other delegate you got to walk around and get to know everybody I think she also got interested very interested in fact in the substance of the work and she was a proactive\nAnd it was a time I think a marked contrast to\nThe secretary of state Mr Rex Tillerson who was really kind of a shrinking violet than a closeted himself in his office and just to establish much of a public persona nor much of a relationship with his environment\nOne claimed though that Nikki Haley made is that the U.S is now more respected at the un do you think that that's a fair characterization you that accurate\nLook I think we've always been a respected uh you know maybe in one respect or another you might be able to point to that but I prefer to view it as the fact that we're the most powerful country in the world is still\nHasn't seen that the status of the U.S has been elevated to under her in the well the un\nI you know she can make that argument I'm not going to over there but I'm also going to say that I think for a long time since the end of World War two of the United states has been the largest economy the largest military and the most influential country in the world\nI think she's taking seriously the responsibility of trying to maintain our influence of the United nations she hasn't laid back she's been forceful she's been a bit forward on her ... but I think she's taken seriously the idea of playing a leadership role\nOn behalf of the United states at the un and for that I commend her\nWhy do you think President Trump should be looking for when considering as he's considering the replacement for Nikki Haley\nTwelve first of all I mean president should always consider people who they are going to be comfortable working with secondly ideally somebody with a some international experience of whatever\nWhether it's international business or a think tank or or politician ... somebody who's got a an a mind that the you know it's OK America First for the American idol alone and\nOne of the people most responsible for taking care of but not alone part mhm is the U.S the best in the United nations you're dealing with all almost two hundred countries\nIt's international relations seven by

rounded up enough money to reach the million dollar mark\nIn Fresno, California prosecutor Andrew Janz pulled in more than four million dollars this summer from his Democratic donors one reason is his

today\nAnd was never seen walking out Robin Wright wrote that New Yorker article she is a long time chronicle or of the middle east who's been visiting Saudi Arabia since Nineteen eighty one and she joins me now Robin good to speak with you\nGood to be with you [noise] let me flip back on you that question that you posed in the New Yorker how real a possibility is it that Saudi Arabia murdered Saudi journalist democracy okay\nIt's just stunning that there is no proof of life now in a week and that the Saudis have offered no explanation for what happened to him his fiance waited for eleven hours outside of the conflict and\nFinally because he left it felt on behind with a warning to call ... she did and that's where we stand in that as little as we know today\nThe Saudis have offered a denial of any involvement the embassy here in Washington put out a statement calling or any claims of involvement outrageous and expressing concern for ... well being um it sounds as though you take those denials with a grain of salt\nWell I'm very struck by the fact and all that talk to me quite frequently over the past year about the threat he fell to his life even being in Washington DC\nYou've known him for decades I should mention I've known him for a long time and Jamal head I've talked to you and quoted off over the past year\nIn his growing criticism about the government effectively led by the crown prince Mohammed bin film on\nAnd he he told me in August that he was worried about the threat to his life and that that the kingdom would like to see him out of the picture as he put it I think he didn't realize how real that possibility would date or otherwise he would not have gone into the consulate\nIn Istanbul yeah you're right that the mystery surrounding his disappearance fit into a broader pattern a trend of silencing just sent it to me about that what's the pattern that you see\nThe pattern is a clamp down on activists even as the\nGovernment talks about reforms in modernizing society and opening up to whether it's women wore the young a social life and\nAllowing movie theaters for the first time it's very striking that the kingdom jak as it allowed women to drive all started picking up some of the biggest women activists one that's recently been sentenced to death and one of the most striking things drum Oliver said to me\nWith quite recently when he said that the crown prince with totally autocratic and\nTotally a liberal and\nThat he was concerned not just for his own life but for others which had led him to take a position he never thought he would remember this is a man who was a reluctant dissident he was someone who had ordered the monarchy and still didn't principle it was the type of role and the the ...\nOf the young ... print that had led him to worry that his own life and to sneak out for the first time after years of saying nothing when his own friend arrested\nHow far outside the realms of what is normal and Saudi Arabia are the crown princes tactics I mean Saudi Arabia as you well know it's never claimed to be a liberal democracy\nLook there are many murders governments around the world and Saudi Arabia has arguably the most dismal record on human rights of any country in the world but it's kind of extra territorial action\nIs really very unusual and a crackdown against someone who's not in Saudi Arabia crack down on people who shouldn't be the face of a new young person who claimed that he was a reformer really is very telling about the state of the kingdom\nThank you Robin thank you\nThat's the New Yorkers Robin Wright speaking with us about the disappearance of Saudi writer and dissident Jamal ... it's been a little more than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging

here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any well training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as new\nPeter shelf co owner of Chelsea

Greg ... so do people where you are seem to be taking the hurricane seriously enough at this point the adequately preparing\nWell it's hard to say you know here in Tallahassee is very calm um you know we didn't get a lot of advance warning on this this a hurricane or just kinda popped up over the weekend in the holiday weekend for some people and the government city\nSo I think a lot of people were slow to pick up on it plenty of water and other supplies still available the store's not big crowds here down in Panama City as we heard of that big county area there is a much more concerned because that's near where the hurricane made make landfall category three in a high winds a massive storm surge\nAnd so there's a lot of concern about getting people out there especially because a major bridge will be closed when the winds get too high what about the Tallahassee\nArea specifically what are the concerns there\nWell you know you have a couple of hundred thousand people who live in Tallahassee it's the capital of course and hear the concern really is about ... of the high wins I Will get from a category three storm you know um we'll get it at least hurricane strength maybe a ... strong tropical storms are wins but that there are a lot of trees and this in this town here\nAnd the trees come down to power lines come down and that of course we lose power a it's a town that there's all these big ... live oak trees Spanish moss very picturesque city but these big trees have relatively shallow roots around and do a a guy named Harold barber or who's up picking up last minute hurricane supplies\nAnd he was born and raised Tallahassee here's what he says about the trees\nAnd we'll recap five either and the stone I see that come up by the ... the whole room come out of the ground the leaves get heavy get top heavy and you got that wind pushing it yeah they will come all\nYou know two years ago her main was a category one hurricane but that one knocked out power here for some people for a week so there's a lot of concern what\nWe're hearing though is that officials are most worried about hurricane Michael storm surge how high of a surge are we talking here at this point\nRight this is a good one of those we haven't had a hurricane like this and quite some time or maybe ever in this part of Florida and putting them attract you may see an eight to twelve foot storm surge we're all just say in the Big Bend area you know that's the corner where the let's look connects to the panhandle in Florida\nAnd they'll be significant search all along the panhandle going uh west that would be that's the reason for that all these coastal counties have had these evacuations it's the water that actually is the risk to life and limb\nAnd it has to do with the geography here at the continental shelf extends real far out into the Gulf relatively shallow and the water just piles up and that we may see here ah tomorrow\nOK That's NPR's Greg Allen in Tallahassee thanks very much crank you're\nWelcome now to the Supreme Court where this morning protesters had a message for the newest justice\n\n[laughter]\nDays after the Senate voted narrowly to confirm him Brett Kavanaugh made his first appearance on the high court bench\nNPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was watching the oral arguments and she's here now to tell us about them hey Carey Hi Mary Louise so we heard the protesters outside the court what was it like in say today well after all the rancor of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings in the Senate things were quiet inside the court know disruptions no arrest\nKavanaugh's wife actually was there his two daughters skipped school to attend\nRetired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there to of course Kevin replaced him on the bench\nAnd at the start of the day chief justice John Roberts said it gives me great pleasure\nWelcome justice cabin out of the court and Robert switched him along and happy career ...\nHe has been busy already he has hired for clerks all of them women I Will note uh we're told who spent the weekend reading up on cases did he actually speak much from the bench today he was really active for his first day on the job that counted more than ten questions from him to both sides mostly technical questions about the state of the law\nThe court today her two cases about what kinds of crimes should trigger the arm career criminal act\nCongress passed that law to take dangerous people off the street it sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past the question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or burglaries counted or not [noise]\nSounds like neither of those cases today or ones with big political or ideological divide winner cases going to come before him that would test this new five for makeup of the court\nYeah the docket is not super polarized so far but there is a good chance the high court will consider whether to accept some cases that could wind up being blockbusters cases that they have to do with President Obama's docket immigration plan he says they might hit religious liberty against the rights of algae P. T. people or cases about the power in return the executive branch\nAt least one of the justices today appear to be playing a long game that Elena Kagan ... she was appointed by President Obama but she and Brett Kavanaugh go back away she hired him to teach at Harvard law school when she was a dean there they behaved very warmly together today laughed a lot\nHe shook her hand as he left the bench the issue is whether she's trying a charm offensive on this new justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench Everytime huh\nBut what about the the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan whatsoever in Christ I think is the word you used that there would be this cloud of partisanship hanging over him and a hangover the court did you see any\nSign of that not in the courtroom today Brett Kavanaugh of course introduced some of this himself in the Senate when he mentioned in organized campaign to go after him even citing the Clintons he spoke Monday Night at a ceremony at the White House saying he wanted to be impartial in fair and part of a team of nine justices on the court\nBut Kavanaugh also went out of his way at that event at the White House ... thanks senators who made the difference in his confirmation people like Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd President Trump did not help matters when he sat Kavanaugh had been proven innocent of assault allegations that actually did not happen the president also apologized cabin on Monday for what he called that terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to him during this campaign to get on the bench\nThere was no hint of any of that in the Supreme Court today a very different story inside the Supreme Court it sounds like a thanks very much carried my clash and That's NPR's Carrie Johnson [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News the or on to UT\nNinety four and five support comes from live oak Brewing Company of European style loggers nails and the black forest and German inspired Texan made to trust our menu and catering and grief order details at black forest age he acts that time\nI ever whether Jeff now from the ... of Mary Washington spectrum news\nWe had a line of thunderstorms that moved across central Texas that around that last today and that was a cold front stone now behind it and dry and cooler weather for the rest of the work week overnight not expect partly cloudy mostly clear skies temperatures dropping the lower half the sixties and if you offer fifties and the whole country plenty of sunshine for your Wednesday afternoon\nTemperatures climbing it's the upper seventies lower eighties but just slightly below normal to have an ear\nInfection is I mean they're all just marry Lawson for K U T Ninety point five\nThank you Mary right now and the Austin area [noise] temperatures in the seventies and a window to the more support\nComes from Austin community college reminding students that federal applications for student financial aid now open for spring and fall two thousand Nineteen more at Austin C.

who donate to this NPR station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I now said Chang this morning began with a surprise resignation from the White House Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations says she will step down by the end of the year\nWhen she and President Trump spoke to reporters that the White House today they took turns praising each other\nShe's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important blade but she also is somebody that get sick\nAnd Haley tried preemptively to answer a question about her future\nFor all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing it for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nAnd All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now to talk about all of this he Mara Hi Elsa so why now why is really stepping down ...\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote her resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's terminally millionaire self she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure forms\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe some time in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as kind of a raft deserting the sinking ship\nRight might have been held it yeah so that they have different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen the ... that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet you know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out\nThis independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of many relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate herself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia and Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley has confused and she retarded very friendly and said I don't get ten times a day she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different with the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately not some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burn a Sharon brand as someone independent\nForeign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician\nSo as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but are we to assume that this is really the end of her political career\nWe are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty um she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run in twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established\nAnd it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared\nWas such a hidden genius that no one understands [laughter] of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump family\nThat's NPR's Mara Liasson thanks Martin thank you [noise]\nThe national Security Agency is the country's largest intelligence agency\nAnd among its most secretive from NSA headquarters is a huge black cube of a building surrounded by endless parking lots and tight security out in Fort Meade Maryland just outside Washington agencies work touches everything from Russian hacking to cyber warfare to the privacy of us citizens\nYet the NSA rarely speaks oh NPR's Greg Myre we paid a visit there to meet someone who would speak and who wants to make the agency more open\nThe innocent he's Rob Stuart is a talkative guy at a place that specializes in eavesdropping\nA big federal government agency it spends a lot of taxpayer dollars and so it was a general matter I think the public has a right to know uh how it's funds are being spent\n... became the NSA inspector general in January as an independent watchdog the sprawling intelligence agency he really likes to talk about whistle blowers\nI felt very strongly that this was a key function for an inspector general's office to have a robust whistle blower program\nHis office received five hundred and sixteenth calls on its hotline during a recent six month period they run the gamut from complaints about contractors who allegedly charge too much to whistle blowers who claim they suffered reprisals\nStorage of former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms still he's playing a visible role at an agency that often seems invisible with its spy missions and classified budgets\nAnd they say it's always been the most secret agent ... a far more good than the CIA\nAbove sacrifices a lot to be here he only gets to call his mother once a month there's no Internet back home no space time he tells me in broken English\nEvery month I call my my I live in a

the Pakistani students will become Mandarin teaches right now he says there's about twenty two thousand Pakistanis studying in China the fourth largest Saudi of foreign students\nIn the country

can tell her age [laughter]\nShe's currently studying fuzzier therapy\nAnd from my high study I may go to China do you think it opens job opportunities that he's studied Chinese [noise] I think so because as I'm studying to be if I go I should I be like to smooth and visit her faith do their best and that\nSo I can go there for my high status\nShe says even if she doesn't study that she hopes she can visit some day and that reflects something else happening in ...\nThis new sense that China is cool it signals a profound transformation in Pakistan's relationship with China for decades it was centered around security and a shed just trust that neighbor India\nNow it's slowly becoming a relationship between people and that might make this old relationship even stronger Andrew small is the author of the book the China Pakistan access\nI think you start to have something that is actually a more sort of sustainable called home prices for the relationship and you had before it it just being so then in the ... I think it would be interesting to see to what extent kind of long um national outlook does that she change\nAnd this changing relationship between the two countries has led to long term relationships of another kind of that so I Need to narrow at her parents' house she's Pakistani her husband in heaven is Chinese that they've been married for four years and have a toddler they call her a hybrid\nName is ... that's about to send you name had Siamese name ...\nHer name is ... feet\nHe's eleven months old in Chinese people maybe people\nFrom all the narrow onion hang met on Valentine's Day he was at a hotel translating for a woman offering acupuncture and she was then to get a free session\nSo I saw him the first time\nI remember she's my somebody told me\nThese kinds of ... unheard of in Pakistan before the pack before this massive influx of Chinese money and industry in fact their relationship was so new that her father initially refuse to give his blessing it took him for years to approve a union you know hand says it was worth it\nBefore getting married always the lead them seeing me the but it was good amenities that go to all I Want\nBut the couples own experience suggests that things aren't so easy you know doesn't think Pakistan is safe for their daughter but the nearest feels like an outsider in China they hope to immigrate maybe to Canada even as they try to figure out their own situation ... says China is transforming Pakistan\nAnd its transforming relationships at the same time no matter how fragile and difficulty off\nShe says look at these on the highways China is building protests out\nWhen people are making the rewards it's not just started or it's kind of an opening a new word ... date NPR News Islam of that [noise]\n\nTomorrow on MORNING edition each year about five million Americans become ill and end up in intensive care doctor say more than half of those who recover going to suffer serious mental problems like dementia\nWe've been following people for over ten years now in the brain tissue study which we didn't hear Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dimension you hear about the steps being taken to address that's on tomorrow's MORNING EDITION just ask your smart speaker to play NPR or your local\nStation my name is Jean from [noise]\n\nUh\nOh\n[noise] oh\nYou are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more it alliance for lifetime income dot org\n[noise] from constant contact with hundreds of customize ... emailed tablets for small businesses to reach customers where they are every day there inbox learn more at constant contact dot com\nAnd from gobble a meal kicked company that delivers semi ...\nFeels to be finished at home in Fifteen minutes with one pan gobble sous chefs do the prep work like chopping and marinating this week's menu is at ... dot com slash NPR\nYou're listening to all things considered here on cutie\nKU cheese advisory board meets throughout the year\nThe meetings are open to the public a schedule of meetings can be found in the bounce section of K.
