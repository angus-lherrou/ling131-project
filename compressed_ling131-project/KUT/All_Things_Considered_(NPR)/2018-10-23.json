{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Has cold haze talks in Moscow today with President posting productive despite a main subject having being America's decision to pull out of a Cold War era nuclear arms control treaty speaking after the talks he blamed the Russians to the U.S decision to pull out of the treaty\nI think this recognizes the change reality and I think a\nGiven Russian violations of the treaty as well you ... you have to rely on the ah the facts on the grounds of the\nBest of both inside relations were in a new era and he highlighted Russian interference in us elections is harming them with regards to the u._s. unilateral decision to pull after the Tracy Mr Bolton has struck a sanguine tone downplaying the risk of a new nuclear arms race\nBut how could that be the case with President Trump having already talked about upping America's nuclear arsenal a Moscow correspondent et cetera rains that when\nI think it's inevitable if you listen to what set by science or a ... at least in public and certainly President Putin made it came in the past that if the U.S wants to withdraw from this treaty and John Bolton to set up is going to happen it's simply a question of of when uh the u._s. submit sit formal\nA notice of that uh if if that happens when that happens then Russia will respond in mirror attempts to whatever the United states does\nI think there's a question about how far Russia in particular can go economically on this you know how much you can afford to keep pouring into a developing and then building producing will miss files but at the moment the intention is absolutely clear that Russia will never any move for the United states\nDoesn't help the states that the relationship with Europe is this little ... than it was because it's Europe it's going to ban the consequences of this isn't it\nWell I think absolutely your cars going to buy the consequences and in fact that's what people have a point to a they say that Europe is becoming a hostage of an American move on you know I think there's a slight sense here in Russia that\nUh the politicians think perhaps that there is a still time to to persuade the United states to to shift position I sent me the language and the crime and although with stock warnings that language has been quite calm the tone is being quite calm saying this is a risky step to take it\nUp and not ready to ... if you'd like it sounds almost like they expect the United states to step back and they've been sort of suggesting that this is about domestic politics in the United states that Donald Trump is simply\nA saying what's his audience needs to head so I don't know if that's the ultimately to be true but setting that don't get the sense that Russia is really all that worried about what's going on\nAnd to what extent does the suits the domestic political agenda in Russia\nWell it's certainly allows president who tend to grandstand pets or if we bear in mind that the president has talked about the collapse of the USSR as a as a tragedy and he said he wants to see Russia\nAs a superpower again then I think this allows him to to sort of a play that role let puts Russia back a nose to nose with the United states talking about nuclear weapons and nuclear capability so I think you know place very much the domestic audience\nThe BBC's Sarah range but in Moscow let's hear now from Franklin see Miller in Washington he's principal of the Scowcroft advisory group and he's so for twenty two years in the U.S department of defense and four years as a senior director for defense policy an arms control on the national Security Council staff\nI asked him if the U.S had made a good decision to pull out of this Cold War arms treaty\nYes because what you heard from your correspondent ... no doubt is what they're telling her but it stands truth on it said so I think it's important to understand what the facts are\nThis treaty was signed in Nineteen eighty seven that prohibited the U.S and the Soviet Union that Russia from building missiles anything anything between five hundred five thousand five hundred and fifty kilometers range\nIn about twenty twelve the Russians began a covert program cheating program to develop such missile by twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen they were testing it which is prohibited by the treaty and by twenty sixteen they were pulling it and they are deploying battalions of these weapons today which threatened Western Europe\nThe United states has abided by the treaty in its entirety so the treaty is that the Kremlin killed this treaty was a very cynical decision to proceed with a prohibited weapons system of course Mr ... calm because he's currently deployed weapons while the United states is constrained by the treaty knock to deploy weapons\nSo it's what Mr Trump often says they'd be making fools of us those foreigners\nI wouldn't go that far I Would say that the Russians have cheated on this treaty justice they treated on the chemical weapons convention and used used nova Chuck in Salzburg when they're not supposed to have those kinds of weapons anymore\nHow can what the us is proposing which is up ... nuclear weapons can't possibly make the world is safer place\nGo back to Nineteen eighty seven why did the Soviet Union sign the IMF treaty the Soviet Union signed the IMF treaty because it did not like NATO's cocker deployments of ground launch crews and purging to to counter the van Russian ss twenty threat recognizing that there was a NATO counter Mr Gordon\nJust signed a treaty Mr Clinton is currently free to deploy this treaty violating system without any western counter\nAnd American counter to the system which doesn't have to be deployed in Europe can ... it could be the basis of some sort will say to the Russians there are consequences to violating a treaty and perhaps maybe one or we think this whole thing\nThese weapons that they were talking about Thirty years ago world trained on Europe one day and presumably they will be again not just that can send you a tool\nIt's not a will be it's they are these weapons have been ... by the Russians and yes it does concern me because as a member was full of people saying this makes it more dangerous but the ... the Russian weapons are out there right now that's the whole point\nThe Russians are threatening Western Europe where these weapons right now having violated the treaty to deploy them and what we would like is for those weapons to be discarded in scrap\nWe've been negotiating with the Russians for four years to ask them to do that they're only response has been to put more weapons in the field so if the west deploys a counter perhaps we returned to the to the days when the IMF treaty was originally negotiated and the Russians back often we've destroyed those new weapons as well\nIf President Trump espousing on short term proliferation delivering on loan to an arms control it's quite a gamble isn't it\nKnow what's the alternative to do nothing and let the Russians continued to deploy additional numbers of these violating systems\nWould Russia perhaps ... a a a universal treaty bringing the likes of China\nThat's an open question but the way they do that would be the beginning some diplomacy in that regard not to violate the existing treaty and put battalions of these weapons in the field to strengthen Western Europe and China isn't it\nAnd when John Bolton said that his talks with good humor and and pleasant enough in Moscow do you believe in\nI couldn't possibly comment that wasn't there\nBut it doesn't sound from what you're saying there's anything good humid all pleasant going on behind the scenes\nLook a treaty is our son and the expectation that both parties will abide by when one party has a record of six years of cheating on that treaty it doesn't sound very good for for international diplomacy in fact it undercuts the whole notion of signing treaties and the first place\nFranklin see Miller from the Scowcroft advisory group in Washington DC\nThat was news out thank you for listening to buy for now\nYou've been listening to the b._b._c. on

leading into the mid term election day October twenty third and this is all things considered\nI'm Audie Cornish and I know if the Chang low fat check the president claims on the caravan of migrants making its way to Mexico later Sandra Day O'Connor and now says she's been diagnosed with what made the Alzheimer's will learn more about the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court\nDepressed and fleas challenge to decide I Want to point qualified woman to the courts and I'm going to do it if I have a chance and he did and voting rights advocates raised concerns that new restrictions at the ballot box\nFor many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten NOW News\nAll right let's turn back now to the caravan of migrants thousands of Central Americans are now on route from southern Mexico heading to the U.S to seek they say a safer lights\nSituation puts Mexico in a tough position the Trump Administration doesn't want these migrants to cross into the u._s. but Mexico doesn't seem to be making much effort to stop the migrants from continuing their journey north\nTo talk more about makes it his position in all of this we're joined now by Arturo ... he's a former Mexican ambassador to the U.S welcome thank you thank you for having me\nSo how difficult as a predicament is is from Mexico right now\nWell there's no doubt but Mexico's cope between a rock and hot place first because the dynamics of the U.S Mexico bilateral relationship tries migration and North American security of the fact that Mexico in the United states would be working hand in hand to ensure that our borders are secure it's also challenge because of our own\nWith Central American the need to ensure that the Central American nations particularly on Buddhas what the mother I'm just I Love old can develop in such a way where their economic prosperity can be strengthened\nOkay so you had a number of concerns there or the U.S relationship with Mexico the very real migration concerns is there a concern for Mexico about its international image and all it\nIs absolutely there's no doubt that since two thousand fourteen when Mexico started repack creating a very high numbers of Central American migrants that there's a double challenge one is domestically because a lot of people in Mexico believe Mexico's during the U.S is quote unquote dirty work by\nStopping in deporting these individuals back to their countries taking care of the problem for the U.S taking care of a problem for us with very little returned from the U.S for doing that\nAnd then the other challenges with international multinational organizations of NGOs that believe it or not I I agree with them in many ways that Mexico is not observing it since national politicians to provide individuals who have a bona fide reason to fear for their lives with a refugee or asylum hearing in Mexico\nWe seen Mexican authorities deploying riot police but at the police don't seem to be using force they don't seem to be stopping these migrants in any way does it seem like Mexico is not making a real effort to stop the flow of these migrants into the U.S\nMexico was being doing humans work and supporting us since two thousand and fourteen but in an area like why does that mean what does it mean to support that it it means that does not fleeing because of persecution or fear for their lives most of them are being detained\nAnd deported and I think that Mexico using force\nTo shut down its border would play into the hands of those who are in this country or weaponized sing or seeking to weaponize immigration policy\nAren't who would use only deterrence to modify tries migration partners would have structural reasons I'm good will not be addressed by deterrence loan\nDo you get the sense that it should be the Mexican government's obligation or it should be they're burning to process has many asylum seekers as possible within Mexico's borders rather than letting them continue their journey to the U.S\nThose who wish to stay in Mexico after you leave the problem is the majority of the Central America and don't want to stay in ... migrants don't want to stay in Mexico Mexico is a ... to the U.S Mexico border\nThe challenges when you are Mexican authorities tell them you won't apply for asylum in Mexico they say no we want to go to the United states\nSo unless you have something akin to what the us has to be with Canada in terms of safe third country agreement it's very hard to ensure that by processing them they can stay in Mexico instead of right during the trucks with us for well I\nThink the incoming Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador how do you think he might approach the situation differently if these caravans do continue into the next Mexican administration\nSaid that he will try and give these many of the Central American migrants a work visa to be able to stay and work in Mexico\nFor ... years of labor pat as as a source of jumper labor the problem here is that unless Mexico and also the United states devise a feasible temporary worker program that allows for the legal flow of temporary workers coming back and forth our borders\nThese issues will be stopgap measures\nFormer Mexican ambassador to the U. S.

President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton is in Moscow today he reiterated the administration's announcement from this weekend that the U.S does intend to withdraw from the thirty year old nuclear nonproliferation treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and the cow Gorbachev\nToday in Moscow Bolden said the treaty has outlived its purpose\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral listing missile related treaty in a multi polar world\nJoining us now to talk about what all of this woman is Melissa hand them at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ... nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thank for having me so is what John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed its prime\n[noise] no not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union a first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven at one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect our lives by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them how we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe when they originally created disagreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able\nTo prevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do and\nTo ah Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nDon't take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out\nThis treaty so it's true\nThat the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called a ... on twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installation or to hit an aircraft carrier and that's what the U. S. is kind of considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal then they can do so\nCould pulling out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations\nAt this point certainly they both holds today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world\nAnd it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now does leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world\nLess safe for a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nAnd deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't do\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under ... ... and she's in pain we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nThe largest warhead is the one that has the security\nUm that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent ...\nMelissa ... of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\nThank you for listening to all things considered here on K U T Ninety point five where we so often hear fascinating interviews in the afternoon and not just interesting interviews been ones that\nAt least in this case and often in other cases deal with\nOur future the future of humankind and which is certainly among the broader implications of weapons of mass destruction proliferation something that I could we can safely say affects the song [laughter]\n[laughter] I don't think so and we all I think all of us have our own areas of expertise topics that we know a lot about that we're passionate and we there's no way that we could possibly have depth on every subject and that's what's so great about being able to spend four minutes\nListening to Melissa head I'm Talking about weapons of mass destruction bringing us up to speed now you walk away a little bit smarter\nAnd every day you do that day by day by day is like exercising your brain gets a workout you become a more intelligent more well rounded enlightened human being and if that has any value to you\nAll we're asking you to do today it's put a dollar amount on that is that worth five dollars a month to is it worth twenty dollars a month or two [noise]\nWhatever it is go to ... dot org click on the donate button and let us know and then you're done and you remember and we're working on this matching pledge which is going down where we are now to\nA less than two thousand dollars to go now on this five thousand dollar matching pledge from serious logic and also Jason new lender and Sarah Andrea Shea of generously put up that five thousand dollars to encourage other folks\nWho haven't yet or become members of this a public radio station\nOr to go to the phone or go on line at K.

to the caravan of migrants thousands of Central Americans are now on route from southern Mexico heading to the U.S to seek they say a safer life\nSituation puts Mexico in a tough position it ... doesn't want these migrants to cross into the U.S Mexico doesn't seem to be making much effort to stop the migrants from continuing their journey north\nTo talk more about makes it his position in all of this we're joined now by Arturo ... he's a former Mexican ambassador to the U.S welcome thank you thank you for having me [noise]\nSo how difficult predicament is is from Mexico right now\nWell there's no doubt that Mexico was caught between a rock in the ... first because the dynamics of the U.S Mexico bilateral relationship\nTries migration and North American security of the fact that Mexico in the United states would be working hand in hand to ensure that our borders are secure it's also challenge because of our own relations\nWith Central American money to ensure that the Central American nations particularly on Buddhas what the law undecided voter can develop in such a way where their economic prosperity can be strengthened\nOkay so you say in number of concerns there uh the U.S relationship with Mexico the very real migration concerns of migrants coming from Central America into Mexico is a real concern from Mexico about its international image and all it is\nAbsolutely there's no doubt that since two thousand fourteen when Mexico started repatriating very high numbers of Central American migrants\nThat there was a double challenge one is domestically because a lot of people in Mexico believes that Mexico is doing to us is quote unquote dirty work by stopping in deporting these individuals' back to their countries taking out of the problem for the U.S taking care of a problem for us with very little returned from the U.S for doing that\nAnd then the other challenges with international multinational organizations and NGOs that believe it or not I I agree with them in many ways of Mexico is not observing it since national politicians to provide individuals who have a bona fide reason to fear for their lives with a refugee or asylum hearing in Mexico\nWe see Mexican authorities deploying riot police but at the police don't seem to be using force they don't seem to be stopping these migrants in any way does it seem like Mexico is not making a real effort to stop the flow of these migrants into the U.S\nI think Mexico is being doing humans work and supporting us since two thousand and fourteen but in this area like why does that mean what does it mean to spoil that it it means that does not fleeing because of persecution or fear for their lives most of them are being detained\nAnd deported and I think that Mexico using force\nTo shut down its border would play into the hands of those who are in this country or weaponized sing or seeking to weaponize immigration policy and who would use\nOnly deterrence to modify tries migration patents that have structural reasons and that will not be addressed by deterrence loan\nDo you get the sense that it shouldn't even Mexican government's obligation where it should be they're burning to process as many asylum seekers as possible within Mexico's borders rather than letting them continue their journey to the U.S\nThose who wish to stay in Mexico absolutely the problem is that the majority of the Central America and don't want to stay in ... migrants don't want to stay in Mexico Mexico is a\nConduit to the U.S Mexico border\nThe challenges when you uh Mexican authorities tell them do you want apply for asylum in Mexico they say no we want to go to the United states\nSo unless you have something akin to what the us has to be with Canada in terms of safe third country agreement it's very hard to ensure that by processing them they can stay in Mexico instead of right doing the trek to us ... well I\nThink the incoming Mexican president on three if men my Lopez Obrador how do you think he might approach the situation differently if these caravans do continue into the next Mexican station\nHe has said that he will try and give these many of the Central American migrants a work visa to be able to stay and work in Mexico for years the labor pat as as a source of\nJumper labor mhm the problem here is that unless Mexico and also the United states devise a feasible temporary worker program that allows for the legal flow of temporary workers coming back and forth our borders\nThese issues will be stopgap measures\nFormer Mexican ambassador to the U.
