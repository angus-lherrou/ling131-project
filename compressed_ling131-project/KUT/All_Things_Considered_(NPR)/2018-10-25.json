S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and she knew you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more caravans which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument so actually\nStates over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measure\nThey're just trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nWelcome back guys that you often to be okay so what is going on in Nineteen eighty eight that is feeding all this energy and hip hop\nWell I mean eighty eight is a banner year I mean and it stretches estimation\nIt's the last time there was truly a meritocracy where the best art is sold the most amount of records based on the fact that they would do we saw independent labels collaborating with major labels to get water distribution but not compromising the music\nAnd we saw a hurled of black consciousness we just saw a of a great variety of women and men or if it was just like if you look at the tops and artist of of the era none of them sounded the same and they also talked about something different\nYou have comedians like this marquee you had a rock him who's very serious some pretty much made a career of Romney but how dopey is yeah you have Chuck the militancy you had more accessible hip hop with Jesse Jackson the fresh prince of which was incredibly buried and just really rich\nAnd then you had a storyteller like slick Rick\nLadies and gentlemen and low light\nIt is without than in ... that we are here to present tonight slid right\nI Want to talk about that because his album the great adventures of flick Rick is one on your list um but of course he had that you think we should talk a little bit more about flickering has got an eye patch and an attitude\nAnd ... and go again goal and the lyrics that I Can't even really discuss or play in front of my parents like I said well\nI mean he he was a phenomenal stories of what kind of opens the door for hip hop to imagine beyond New York\nHe was born in the u._k. and to not shy away from the British access\nHe also was a style icon he wore jewelry and not that big Kaine didn't as well but because his album went platinum because you want to be raps at the time was blasting\nImagery of rap music on national television in a in a matter of what's unprecedented slick Rick's with his ... suit was ice patch\nIt just kind of breathe life it's a hip hop and so many ways\nThe compliments just went up almost flowing to the beach so that\nThat is not even try to just wipe them why she almost should try to disrespect them regularly\nNow here's the thing with the introduction of\nCharacter and swagger you have a lot of massage and eat right and you have a lot of lyrics that for women hip hop fans we listen to but we weren't loving so how do the women and Caesar apply like what's going on in Nineteen eighty eight what is the music that we're hearing\nYeah you know it's funny in eighty one end up the way came out one of the things that was so shocking about them was there sort of very free use of of curse words however us up to say that massage the kind of awful ideas and stories weren't conveyed without using curse words because there were\nDefinitely a woman countered that and by eighty eight we see a\nA sophistication and relevance of women and hip hop that I don't think we saw prior on the level that it was right there is a release of\nGreenland teeth song wrap my madness oh we love this\nBecause\n\n\nShe arrived on the scene it felt like fully formed like I think people forget just how young she was especially now that she's just like cover girl award winning yeah I mean ... I mean yeah she's had a talk show but back then she was a kid and she was striking she\nIs a phenomenal singer and she was a phenomenal lyricist and M. C.\nYou know despite the massaging the and hip hop when some of my ... came out with a song like this she was immediately accepted when it came out you hurt it everywhere every mix show every club but it was a that record was running\nThe other person I Want to bring up is mc light because I think well I think a Cleveland teeth and someone who does the kind of like singing Iran thing and feels very mainstream I feel like and the lights went really hard [laughter] uh and we have her song here ten percent\nChange can be the main cities jam I really don't like Dan hold their show Ross\n\nSo both of these artists you have people who I think Larry ... are very good but also those lyrics are not just about being attractive [laughter] being about attractive to men um and it feels like that's something I'm gonna remember from eighty eight\nWhy I think overall an eighty eight the premium was to be original unique or really attempt to push the platform forward so what we see what MC lie what was the ... who is the rise of the time as well uh let's see for what we see all the the men who we well we've already mentioned as well\nIs that it was super competitive and it was just like the the doors wide open and and the possibilities which is endless\nYou also see artist having an eye on expanding that that success UC artist that had real street credibility start to make records that perhaps compromised the style that endeared them to to fans or did you look at salt and pepper excuse me salt and\nPepper also better crossover hit in Nineteen eighty seven called pushing which you'll still hear in clubs today MC laying on the other hand had no interest in crossing over she was in the street and was just kept ...

a very big part of the anger we see in our society Kathleen Hall Jamieson who's an expert on political rhetoric at the Annenberg School for communication says Trump's rushed with the conventional didn't last\nHe acted in that moment in a manner that is appropriate for the presidency unfortunately the rhetoric appeared to shift to beginning to blame the mainstream media\nCritics pointed out that Trump himself has a long history of demonizing opponents and at times even condoning violence but speaking to reporters this morning when spokeswoman Sarah Sanders rejected the idea that Trump's no holds barred approach to politics might contribute to a hostile climate and the country\nYou guys continue to focus only on the negative and there is a role to play yesterday the very first thing that the president did was come out and condemned the violence the very first thing your network did was come out and accused the president of being responsible for it that is not okay the first thing should have been to condemn the violent\nScene in President Jeff Zucker who's network was one of the targets of the would be bomber complained yesterday that the president has shown a quote complete lack of understanding about the possible consequences of his continued attacks on the news media in the past Jamison says Americans facing hardship and division have looked to presidents to help wind up their wounds\nShe wonders if perhaps we've lost that capacity not only because Trump is ill suited to play the role of unifier but also because his audience the American people are hard wired to reject\nThat moved to tribalism in this moment is suggestive of deep measures that are making it harder to do things that have unified the country in the face of real threats in the past and that

clear tonight lows in the lower fifties tomorrow\nHides in the mid seventies clearing sky sixty one agrees to five fifty five\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish ten suspicious packages had been intercepted so far packages contain would appear to be explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now\nAnd this story is but the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies welcome to the city among either we don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages of what's known so far but how they were delivered\nRight so the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted at this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service\nOr the packages address for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance we're flag and mail screening facilities by the secret service and two of the packages addressed of Joe Biden were also found in postal facilities in Delaware\nObviously that's important because us yes has screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like this\nWhen it comes to mail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance or maybe most importantly is who that package is going to\nIf you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance uh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we're talking about\nA period of a sense using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process or at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they that because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with\nThey can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own mail\nOn the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have caused can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYet it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they the the U.S Postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I kind of puts it into perspective\nA specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into\nA hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions or in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics ah is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nUh not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now uh I talk with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials and the media members in the case of CNN who seemed to have been targeted by\nThese packages but there's also postal workers who were put in danger who are carrying pacts pointed to point B were also in danger in these situations uh if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers or who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are gonna be changed but we're definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's Miles Parks thanks so much

available that this person is done or anything that suggests you that there may be a lot more packages after\nOne area of his behavior that I find very concerning that suggests any he may not be finished as a person evolves in a serious crime so does their motivation\nThis individual may be really becoming very motivated and excited about all of the attention that he's being given\nAnd the fact that you turn on any um network and all you're seeing is his handiwork what he's doing so in order to perpetuate those feelings of power and I'm ... and many serial offenders will tell you\nI felt so powerful when the news was all about me and they decide midway through their series that that's what's causing them to continue and and that could be something that we're looking at down the road here and if that's the case he's not done\nYou're raising them poured important for those of us in the media covering this investigation which is but the public attention and media scrutiny can
