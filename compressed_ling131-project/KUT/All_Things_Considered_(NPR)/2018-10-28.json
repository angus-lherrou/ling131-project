Pittsburgh the city's struggles to make sense of that\nEveryone's saying how you know thoughts and parents ought to that but where\nWe go to ... when he would say for Sunday October twenty eight this is all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nHi Michelle them we're bringing you this program from Pittsburgh where Mayor Bill ... calls it the city's darkest day\nThere's an underlying tone around the world of enough is enough to slow of all of hatred ... and\nWe'll learn more about the shooting ... residents where they go from here\nThe sun was shining and I I felt like that was telling me that you know it's going to be dark and gloomy for a little bit but another part these clouds insure you that I'm Still here\nBut first this news\nAnd finally you noted that you have been hearing from your colleagues phone over the world you know we've been here in the city and we see that this has residents if you know far beyond this neighborhood certainly far beyond even the city and I just I Wonder\nI don't really have a really good question for you just wonder if there's something to do I do data you entertainment is if something I think\nThere's two takeaways than the number one is there are levels of evil or evil manifests itself in a multiple homicide and certainly seemed eleven people's lives being taken from them is definitely something that is\nA felt strongly by a lot of people but it also\nIs when those people are being murdered simply because of the way that they pray and then it takes on a different level when you pray on the elderly or\nYou've prey upon children\nAnd then it takes another level when you go into a place that is sacred to those people end up place that is considered a safe haven becomes a mass grave yard\nWhen all of those different levels of evil or\nOpen there is a natural reaction for people to want to reach out\nAnd just try to help other people but there's a secondary level as well because all the rhetoric and the talk about our different all the notions of how we should not welcome people or people are different and Americans are different\nThere's an underlying tone around this world of enough is enough\n... at this level of hatred hasta and\nThat's Mayor Bill do as far as Mr ... thank you so much for talking to\nThanks have a great day\nAnd now we're going to speak with a member of the congregation door had dash which\nWarships in the building that was attacked and why says with us now in our studios in Pittsburgh who am I thank you so much for speaking with us at such a difficult\nTime ... and we know that

Dan ledger\nIs a tourist steady group many people would be there but he arrived he is now in critical condition and hospital and Jerry ... anyway also arrived early\nHe has died shooting everybody else came later it was actually one of their man Margie gainer came and he had a moment where he could get ... to the basement\nBut otherwise other people are on their way so you know men who died that come earlier and they always do because they are they part of the strengths and core of the congregation\nWhether you're drawing upon to help you process this to live with this\nPeople read poetry at a gathering today I thought that was very useful last night there was a vigil that we attended my husband and I attended and my son with his friend so being around people who are going through the same thing and just having come from a gathering that included to service\nA congregation and getting everybody was saying hubs really matter at this time\nAnd then people you know are

everything and the men Dan ledger was in hospital and Jerry rigged they knew it was killed\nOr too cold where members of our community\nShould not say we're about Dan because he's still alive and I

synagogue here was the target of a mass shooting yesterday eleven people were killed throughout the program we will be hearing from members of the community here and other people who have been touched by this tragedy but I'm joined now by NPR's Sarah McCammon who was in the world hill neighborhood today close to the tree of life synagogues there I think so much for\nSomeone could commit such a a an ... um disgusting crime um you know our organization celebrate mercy teaches about\nThe uh the life and the character of the prophet Mohammad 'em and many of his teaching as hum tell us that we should try to respond to evil\nThat was good you know when someone there's a person the Koran that says\nRepel evil with that which is better and we thought that you know what better way to embody the prophet Mohammed teachings than to try to start a campaign that will help 'em reach out first and\nForemost as fellow human beings but also to you know our Abraham Mick cousins or from the Jewish community\nUm and try to help out in ... in in some way I'm through this horrific ordeal\nHe original goal was twenty five thousand dollars now that you've so you've exceeded its so quickly now you've bumped it up to Seventy five thousand does that say something to you\nI think it says a lot I think it says that there's a lot more good inhumanity than there is a bad and evil and hatred um had to increase the goal now twice and a lot of the donors are not even Muslim I mean we we said clearly under crowdfunding page that\nAlthough this is a Muslim led campaign we welcome people of all faiths or even no faith\nBut but the fact that this is a Muslim led campaign is there some message that you would hope to impart with that\nYeah one particular story from the profits life inspired it and it is like\nThere was a time when the prophet Mohammed was a sitting down with some of his disciples and he noticed a Jewish funeral procession passing by at a distance and he immediately stood up when you saw that Jewish funeral and paid his respect\nHis disciples asked him why are you standing up um this is not a Muslim funerals it's only a Jewish funeral why are you standing\nHis response was so beautiful he said\nIs it not a human soul is it not a human soul and that that that story you know when I when I first saw the desecration at Jewish cemeteries last year and now with what happened at the synagogue um it reminded me of that story from the prophet Mohammed life and ... and ... and it really inspired me\nTo want to start something to want to help out and really to put aside I mean if you look historically Jewish and Muslim communities in America have not worked that closely together I mean often politics gets in the way things that are happening overseas often gets in the way\nBut what's most important is our our shared humanity and we want it to reach out as human beings to help out\nAnd do you have a plan for the funds now that you've exceeded even your own expectations what do you hope to do with the funds that you were raising\nWell we want to do is go to any of the affected families to say you know any costs that you have whether they are deductibles for medical treatment whether you know you've had to have relatives come in from out of town or you know book hotels to to be near you whether it's funeral expenses\nWe as Muslim Americans want to list that financial burden off of the families we we want to be there\nThat is part of the city of the Muslim run nonprofit celebrate mercy attack Emma CD thank you so much for talking thank you for having me\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWe're\nGoing to talk briefly now about the man who allegedly committed these terrible crimes Robert Bowers is forty six years old he was captured alive yesterday and he is in a hospital being treated for multiple gunshot wound\nIf in stable condition NPR's Brian Mann is with us now here in Pittsburgh you tell us more Brian thank you so much for being here Michele so what can you tell us about Bowers background\nYeah this is a guy who wasn't on anybody's radar until he walked into the tree of life synagogue Saturday morning and open fire a here Scott Brady the U.S attorney for the western district\nTo Pennsylvania speaking at a press conference earlier today\nBowers made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people after a standoff with police powers eventually surrendered and remains in federal custody today\nAnd we understand that that was talked a lot about his anti Semitic views before the attack on a social media platform called gab and we understand has become popular with some far right conservatives and All right activist what did he say they're\nYeah his writings reflect really hardcore anti Semitism vicious hatred and a lot of it echoing conspiracy theories Michelle about Jewish leaders including the idea that they're secretly funding undocumented immigrants who are\nComing to the U.S federal investigators say they're looking for a dollar or social media activity is part of their investigation here's Robert Jones with the FBI\nAlready we've conducted a search the subjects house in Baldwin\nAnd the search the vehicle will take place this morning I Can't comment on what was found in those searches we continue to conduct interviews scribes social media review possible surveillance camera video and exploit digital media to determine how wide powers committed this terrible act\nBut I should say the gab this All right social media platform that Bowers used they've been struggling to stay afloat census attacked the Internet service provider kicked them off their servers today so they've been scrambling to find a way just to remain active [laughter] what what kind of\nThought he's been saying about how this attack which is not the first mass shooting we've been seeing but fat in the late ... how was it so deadly\nOnce again this was a gunman who amassed a really incredibly powerful arsenal he was armed with an A R Fifteen semi automatic rifle is as a weapon with a very high rate of fire as well as three ... three fifty seven hand guns\nHas already said today he used all of those weapons during the attack a and it appears so far that he acquired the mall legally and I should say that officials do think he acted alone but there is heightened security tonight across Pittsburgh\nAnd I said earlier powers is in the hospital under arrest which are just does he face\nTotal of twenty nine federal charges so far including a murdering victims who were exercising religious beliefs are and also harming police officers at the press conference today they were blond about the fact that some of these charges do carry the death penalty
