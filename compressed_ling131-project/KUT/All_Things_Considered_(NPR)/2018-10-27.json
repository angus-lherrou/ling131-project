doping the shocking events that have unfolded here will lead song to start to treat those with whom they have differences with a little more compassion and respect David Schaper NPR News Fort Lauderdale\nAs we heard Cesar say I allegedly sent pipe bombs to individuals in a news organization CNN that President Trump freaks\nThey criticize last night though the president bristled at suggestions that his rhetoric is to blame for what he called the sinister actions of one individual\nBut we wonder if it's fair to ask if his tone has created a climate conducive to violence like the mail bombs or the carnage at a synagogue today I talked about this with professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson an expert on political discourse at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of communication\nWe talking about the complaint of critics that President Trump has normalized and quote unquote other ring of people attacks on political opponents as enemies\nThe president the United states has a unique capacity to determine what are accepted political norms of discourse\nAnd to the extent that he it spans those outside the normal boundaries he says to everyone else those expanded boundaries are now Andres in which you can not only speak but speaking public and not be afraid of sanctioned and for them that we have told Donald Trump accountable\nI mentioned you that we've been traveling around a state of this week meeting with all kinds of people I spoke with a group of Trump supporters were going to hear from them out later this weekend\nThey profess not to have heard any of the president's attacks on individuals the media I you know I was asking them about the tone that the president sets but they prefer not to hurt any of that\nWe all live to some extent within our own like minded communities and when we live inside our own media bubble were far more likely to see the world through the filter that it offers so to the extent that the president is saying things that have been normalized inside that constituency they're not going to remember it specifically it's going to be a background assumption\nThere have been any device of moments in American history of any violent moment I mean assassinations politically motivated bombings the civil war for that matter how old are you you can ... the era as a person who studied communication throughout our history\nThe difference between then and now is that now exist in an environment in which these horrific acts that is bombs were sent to people ... two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not\nWhether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them but it suggest as we've lost our capacity be horrified by the sort of action was lost our ability to say whether\nThey were Democrats or Republicans we disapprove of this action profoundly and we're going to ask if the climate that is conducive to it something that we are in any way contributing to for example when someone's driving around with a van with pictures that suggest just remember him at the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun\nThat that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then I tend to rally in park that than go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T shirts how we manage to normalize that so much that in this moment we couldn't come together and say\nWhoever did this this is highly problematic we disapprove of it and we're going to look at the broader culture and ask how we minimize the liquid there will ever happen again\nThat is Kathleen Hall Jamieson professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for communication her latest book is\nCyber war how Russian hackers and trolls helped elect a president what we don't can't and do know professor James and thank you so much for talking with us

will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia\nYou may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nDo you feel that Donald Trump as a factor and your race\nI think the national figures unfortunately are factors in every race what my job is is what I talk to voters to let them know that elections are a decision than a choice between two candidates in these certain branch of government now independence as it pertains to to going in both directions including the direction of the White House is very important because\nMy beliefs as a problem solver member of the problem solvers caucus is that we ... we believe that checks are what the system is designed to have\nTo check has to go in both directions if you have a situation where you have President Trump in the White House in ... closest speaker you can't just have it checked going in one direction that ... got to go in both directions if you go\nBack to Congress and you were in the minority how let's sit with you\nThe only thing I care about is that we have a block of good people and that's what causes about that are going to drive the solutions that's the primary importance when we're in a position where we're supporting democratic members of our caucus that should tell you our view right I mean it's not so much who holds the majority it's for the ... going to be setting the agenda in Congress and\nIs it true that you have committed to only voting for speaker who will sign on to our family into gridlock orange we break the gridlock in Congress has agreed to that and if there is no Republican who signs on to that would you vote for a Democrat for speaker\nSo here's what we agreed as a group to do that we are only going to support a candidate that supports these proposals\nIs it difficult for you that being a Republican part of the Republican caucus given the way the president conducts\nWho I think both parties need to have strong sensors in them and I think if either party is hijacked by the fringe on one side of the other that's a bad thing\nDo you see a way out of it out of the the current atmosphere\nIt's up to each and every one of the ... start to the kitchen table and it goes to the White House and everyone in between uh how we talk to each other the tone use whether review differences of opinion as strengths to harness rather than we consider to be criticized I was very very blessed to grow up in a very diverse community and\nI carry that with me the FBI and one problem solving model that we had in the FBI was anytime we had a time sensitive crime problem\nWe what's around the table with people from completely different backgrounds different educational backgrounds different professional backgrounds coming from different parts of the country different regions of the world invariably everybody based on the family they grew up in the city they grow up in where they went to school what they studied pain they may have felt that you and I couldn't fathom\nThat all that's how they approach problems and we put all that together and it always allowed us to get one step ahead of that criminal by pulling everybody's unique perspective together and that's essentially what the problem solvers ... says it's a legislator version of that and I tell everybody I mean if you ever had a chance to sit on the one of those meetings you'll be so proud of your country\nBecause you ought to see a guy cannot tell who the Democrats or Republicans are that room you know when I leave Congress whenever that is or whatever circumstances that is I just want to be able to say\nThat I I did my part when I was there to advance that belief that we got to get rid of this judging people based on what box they checked on their voter registration form when they're Eighteen we got to get past it\nEver since he was ... thanks so much for for talking to us today like you\nAnd WHYY Dave Davies is still with us for a couple more seconds ... congressman fitzpatrick almost went to ... took pains to identify more as a member of the No Labels group or the problem solvers conscious than he did with the Republican Party what do you make that\nShe has a case to make that he's an independent who voted against the repeal of Obamacare he's gotten support support from gun control groups Democrats like India and he will help the Republicans keep control of committee assignments and small legislation nothing Democrats care about will ever get to vote and that's what matters\n[noise] that's a WHYY state David statements have so much for being with us today good to be with

process it but I I just wonder what's going to your mind and the and the time like this I mean did you did this strike at your sense of safety as an American as an American Jew I just I'm just wondering how you are processing is\nReally a I'm a shock does anybody in this community you know the truth is that ah we're lucky in Pittsburgh that generally the Pittsburgh Jewish community is a one of the safest Jewish communities in the United states\nUm we've had a community security director for a couple of years has really been improving security at the synagogue in that church agencies and\nSo this comes as even more of a shock uh to me and everybody here\nHow do you think you'll process to spend the next couple of days\nThat it's hard to tell him we are having a a community gathering of tomorrow at five PM oh that's a\nReally all of the synagogues and in Pittsburgh are participating and\nI think in my mind it's time to come together joined together as a community I feel like a Jewish Pittsburgh has a family and so this attack really does feel like a an attack on my own family\nAnd and finally how how can others in the community support you I'm sure there are many grieving with people who are not Jewish what what can they do to support you at this time\nWe've had an amazing outpouring of support both from the church community and the non Jewish community all over Pittsburgh\nOr even now you know just a a couple of hours after this terrible incident um local businesses came out with food for our grief center and I've gotten tax than emails from churches I think that uh\nYou know the best thing to do is to come together and help the community he'll some if people want to give we're going to open an aftershock bought a closes a fund\nFor victims of terror and uh they are certainly contribute to that\nShe didn't leave it there for now Mr hearts and thank you very much for speaking with us it's such a sensitive time I think he's still very much
