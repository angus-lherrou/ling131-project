she and her fellow inmates were disciplined a lot so you'll get it to you for having like a piece of candy\nOr like you have a library book that's overdue and you're on your way to the library\nOnce you picked up a shift working in the kitchen she thought she had permission but a correctional officer gave her a ticket for unauthorized movement and send her to solitary confinement for sixty days the offense she says she received the most tickets for was insolence things like talking back to an officer\nOr then Twenty years of media locked up I mean there's only like three he would I Know that I never got to figure for instance\nWe couldn't get Cosby's prison records but at twenty sixteen audit done in collaboration with the state's department of corrections found that women are disciplined more than men women ...\nSaved on average almost double the number of disciplinary tickets and the biggest disparity in those tickets the ones for influence I Would say as a whole\nWe disciplined

academics and prison staff\nWe found that across the country women are disproportionately disciplined for low level offenses in Indiana women had more than double the rate of tickets than men and three times as many tickets for refusing to obey an order\nIn Vermont female inmates are three times as likely to get a ticket for making derogatory comment and in California women or two and a half times as likely to be ticketed for disrespecting an officer\nAlyssa Benedict as a national expert in a small but growing movement to address this disparity she says this system of punishing women for mostly non violent behavior is causing more problems than at solving\nAll people are suffering right now under hidden that's what we're fighting however is that women are happening very unique impact\nBenedict says that's because women in prison often have a history of trauma\nAccording to the Illinois audit Ninety seven percent of female inmates have been the victims of sexual or physical abuse they show signs of post traumatic stress disorder more than any other study demographic including combat fat that's according to a twenty ten study by the Illinois criminal justice information authority\nAnd the ways that women are controlled and punished in prison with things like isolation strip searches or loss of phone privileges Benedict says these responses exacerbate that past

justice system debuted this week on Monday HBO's gonna air the sentence that is a film about a woman given Fifteen Years in prison for crimes committed by former boyfriend\nThen friday Netflix Davies the second season of it hit true crime program making a murder here to talk with us about these project is NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans Hey Eric huh All right let's talk about the sentence first this was filmed over a ten year period\nBy Rudy van ... says he's the brother of the woman sentenced whose name is Cindy shank\nHow does this show expose issues in the criminal justice system\nWell first I got to say I've been reviewing TV for a long time I was crying by the end of this I mean it the sentences the surprisingly emotional story about a couple of things mandatory minimum sentencing and prosecuting people for crimes committed by their romantic partners so\nValdez his sister Cindy was in this relationship with this guy who was involved in drug dealing and he got killed\nAnd it's six years later after she's married and she's had three kids federal authorities arrest prosecute and convict or on conspiracy charges so and the mandatory minimum sentence for that was Fifteen Years now we've got a clip of Cindy describing what it was like to face that sentence let's check it out\nThe Martians died because that's where I felt like that I got a way not that I Would go\nOn\nForever\nSo her brother Rudy Valdez a documented the struggle for the family to cope and so we see her kids grow up over nearly a decade we see Cindy you move to a prison far away from her family and then there's this emotional twisted and that just drives home how much she's lost over all this time\nIn that clip we just heard she says she's guilty\nShe's guilty of knowing about the crimes that um her boyfriend was committing and not calling the cops are you know doing something to try and stop it having knowledge of a crime a can mean that you're part of the conspiracy to commit the crime\nAnd this Friday the second season of making a murderer is debuting the first season was such a hit tell us about the second season\n[noise] so the first season a expose the mission to the story of Stephen Avery who's this guy in Wisconsin and he was exonerated in two thousand and three by DNA evidence after serving almost Twenty years for sexual assault and attempted murder\nThen he gets arrested and convicted of committing a different murder a few years later along with his nephew who's named uh Brendan Bessie so the first season raises some doubts about the evidence that they collected against Avery\nAnd expose allegations that the nephews confession was unfairly course this season is about a breeze appeal of his conviction and effort spread rented to ask you to have his confession throw it\n... it sounds very like getting into the nitty gritty of the legal process\nWell I think that's one reason why the show might be less impact will because it's a more mundane story about how tough it is to appeal these kinds of convictions\nDid you find a link between the two documentaries\nYeah I I think they both trying to humanize people who've been convicted of crimes and show the really brutal impact of these really long prison sentences I mean we're incarcerating a tremendous amount of people in this country for long stretches of time sometimes for non violent crimes\nAnd it's valuable to have a high profile TV project but just kind of reminds us of the consequences\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans thank you so much for being with us thank you [noise]\n\nHave you any membership
