up the president's even the peninsula seemed to be on the brink of war\nWhether today's changes with more personal or political for him a criticism is a\nGood liar or promoting one oh ...\nOh yes indeed my parents as you are aware off from North Korea and they fled to the south during the Korean War and they had to flee their home and their family and they never got to return to their hometown and they never got to see their family again so in a way\nOf their lives were uh lives that were without root for the remainder of their lives and I feel more than anyone the tragedy of war and the pain of separation of this is why I resolved to never see war again on the Korean Peninsula and also to overcome the pain of conflict so these are my main let's go next to ...\nTo ... for us\nWhen it comes hey I'm going to kill young enough to feign a fake moment for you if you met Kim Jong in three times what he writes\nWho are children is heavily comes on a more humble on it\nI guess I'd during the course of my three\nInch screen summit meetings I made a point of them are releasing as much live and\nRecorded footage as a possible of the two leaders having some meetings as well as other citizens of Kim Jong un himself we release these but to just to the Korean people and other world media so that they could see for themselves and I I'm sure that you've all seen them by now and\nAs for our chairman Kim I can say that some he's young but he is a clear vision to develop a his old country and he's also quite courteous and candidates\nAnd he also has a he respects eldest so I Would

has nuclear weapons we think we have that I think the nuclear weapons I told you what he's willing to do with this current nuclear arsenal\nCurrent on ... to ... or ... or ...\nOr so North Korea has promised immigration and it has the lead that it will be uh relinquishing nuclear weapons in order to concentrate on economic developments and what North Korea saying that if they received during the Ottoman tease than they there was no reason for them to cling on to nuclear weapons\nAnd there's no reason for them to go through the pains of sanctions\nSo I when I was chairman Kim saying a complete denuclearization my understanding is that it will stop from refraining from additional nuclear and missile tests\nAnd also it completely dismantling nuclear production and missile development facilities and also dismantling the existing nuclear facilities and unclear on missile off no I saw a although the assistant protests needs to be seen counting in Washington\nNorth Korea is actually asking for the United states corresponding measures so between myself and chime in Kim we didn't go into detail regarding this or that timetable and specific protests but I Believe that all these elements were included in the concept of ... station at a time and it was\nSort of being organized church which is\nWhere the guy to the end of four declaration if the United states may seem unwilling to offer that looming books curvy s have signed a declaration that they want to buy the age of ... ... ... isn't willing to give the Korean War a war what was the day\nOr ... or knowing how's your day to them but that can you were\nAt the end of all declaration I had ample discussions with President Trump as well as other U.S officials on this issue and if a North Korea\nTakes certain measures and then the end of wall declaration would be a political statements which would announce that the longstanding relations between ... and Washington have ended so we need to have this declaration that's

Baker so what should we read into that interview and what message was descending to Washington and Pyongyang his Laura's assessment\nHe if traveling to Europe and the next ten days\nYou're at in terms of its policy towards North Korea I think that more cat in fact approach it's a bit more prepared to be flexible and he feels that European leaders certainly happened quite supportive\nOf his approach towards North Korea I think he's quite a lonely man in the middle here between kids while it's most unpredictable leader Kim Jong un and don't ... I think he's trying to shore up support just in case he meets that help\nMe da ding so I think you can ... this is a message to you but I'm here I'm coming talk to me and let's see if we can find a way that you can help me in my talks with North Korea\nThey also kind of messages there with the guys in the United states and North Korea\nHe's kind of clearly think the U.S needs to be the typical measures if you want North Korea to give up something\nAt the north Korea has already had let we will blow up they sat dismantle the nuclear site whenever only knew when you clear sites if you are prepared to give us something in return and so far the U.S has seemed unwilling to do so that he needs to keep that\nMessage that now it's going to take ... to act\nThe BBC's Laura ... in Seoul you might already had mentioned to my sister program the real story on Monday the inter governmental panel on climate change issued its latest reports and this week my colleague ...

...\nAnd we're going to talk next about economic fallout titans of business and media and the tech world are supposed to be gathering in a couple of weeks in Riyadh for a huge investment summit Davos of the desert as it's been dubbed the hope was it would attract much needed foreign investment to the kingdom\nBut the RSVP list is suddenly shrinking among those pulling out the head of the world bank the c._e._o. of Viacom the editor in chief of the economist British entrepreneur Richard Branson\nNPR foreign affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has been keeping track of this ever shift in ... and she's here now hey Jackie Hi matter so is this all down too concerned about democracy and what's happening there are people pulling up well\nPart of it is the fact that turkey is blaming the death of a show gate on Saudi Arabia so it doesn't seem like a good idea for a lot of these participants to show up in Riyadh talking business or for a photo opportunity with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on\nOn some like tech venture capitalists Steve Case said they had been looking forward to attending the event\nBut they want to find out what happened to show the first and until then they're going to put their plans on hold\nMany media organizations such as the Financial Times in New York Times CNBC and Bloomberg among others it caught on which I just mentioned here on I'm going out there all pulling out as well in a number of their reporters and editors were due to beyond panels despite this uh this Audi said at the conference will go ahead\n[noise] from Saudi Arabia is perspective how worrying is that I mean how big a deal is this conference to Saudi Arabia and its economic plans\nAre hugely important to Saudi Arabia foreign investment in the kingdom\nHas been falling quite dramatically over the past two years and there's also been a major flight of capital so sad either pulling their money out and putting it adds a real estate or offshore banks or or shell companies so this conference is seen as a way to renew interest in doing business in Saudi Arabia\nAnd organizers were probably hoping for a replay of last year's conference which really generated a lot of excitement about doing business in the kingdom\nBut just two weeks after that conference the crown prince rounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and government ministers so that when they were all\nIn in under house arrest and the Ritz Carlton and\nRaul under house arrest with almost three months in the Ritz Carlton which by the way is where this conference is taking place again this year [noise]\nUh and I know you have recently visited that hotel you've just been reporting for NPR in Saudi Arabia I mean\nTo what extent does\nThe kingdom remain an attractive investment opportunity for the rest of the world\nIt's still remains an attractive place to do business for sure and there is still keep business leaders that are going to attend this conference\nBecause of those opportunities the head of the major Wall Street banks um such as J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie diamond I still expected to attend\nYou know they've been are vying for lucrative role in the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco which is the world's largest oil company so that is a lot at stake here I'm also by the way a treasury secretary Steve I'm In Houston is also expected to attend huh\nAll right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there a civil Wall Street will be there of what Congress ... what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says\nThat ah these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans he announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten ... billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for America\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... cars shaggy situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years\nUntil twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry and often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nAnd you're listening to the voice for margin\nTo get off my lawn [laughter]\nAnd so there there there are several issues here that are\nInteresting to think about when we think about scooter hygiene are not just what you do with a scooter when you're done with it but first of all the attractiveness of just being able to pick up this thing this just happens to be located at a place where you are\nAnd be able to hop on it and go somewhere in it and then just leave\nIt when you're done with it now there is sort of a a carefree attractiveness to the whole idea of that right I don't have to take responsibility I don't have to put fuel in it or not to recharge it\nWas all I got a credit card and I see one of these things and it's not occupied I got me some wheels it's it's\nEverything your mother hated about the way that you grew up exactly you just take the time when you want\nTo leave it wherever you want that we use it because it's convenient right now doesn't build any Carrie [laughter]\nSo so but what's interesting about it is how\nBecause things are so available and so easy people who might in other circumstances feel like that they're responsible people seem to shed all sense of responsibility when\nIt comes to this thing I mean not only in terms of their personal safety you know the safety of other people when they were hurdling down the street at Fifteen miles an hour where there are pedestrians and cars and those kinds of things\nBut also what they decide to do with the scooter when they're done did they put it someplace that's out of the way of for this or in traffic or\nDid they just cut up plop it down wherever they just mounting [laughter] and it remains there are some other people to deal with but I think what's particularly interesting about this is how something that suddenly introduced into an environment we have this other thing we're now our species\nHas now been confronted with this set of options that we didn't have before and how people different people respond to that because I'm sure\nOf course we don't notice them because they're not doing things that caller attention to them there are many responsible scooter users who very carefully\nYou know ride their scooters and park there scooters in a very responsible place but the fact that there is the opportunity to do things that are not necessarily a a considerate of the people with whom you shared\nEnvironment so so I'm going to back up when you know several years ago they they expanded the number of available a Internet addresses and and that led to the dawn of of what has become known as the Internet of things and\nAt the time people are like well what in the world is the Internet of things going to allow us to do like the [laughter] things need Internet and and initially people work on oh yeah yeah because now your thermostat could be connected the Internet oh yeah that makes sense\nNow we we we've reached the\nPoint where we can also just leave things in the world [laughter] and and they know where they are because because because of all these Internet connected devices and and so the scooters are eight or ... or a phenomenon related to bicycles and some other\nTransportation devices in which companies basically are buying up a bunch of things like scooters dumping them them in a in a city creating an app\nWhere you can use the device if you pay a small amount of money when you when you use it the beauty of this is you pick it up where you find it\nYou use it while you're using it you leave it when you're done with it and then somebody else comes along and they get to use it yeah and so we've gone from thermostats\nTwo major Republican I [laughter] in one fell swoop but uh but his father was pointing out it creates this interesting opportunity to observe the development\nOf social norms yes because we we actually up until this point in the in in the United states at least\nPrivate ownership of of things was the norm so the norm was if you wanted to tutor to ride around you bought a scooter\nAnd it was yours and ownership means that you have control over who else gets to use it now [laughter]\nWe have this whole other a way of thinking about things which is we have these objects that that they belong to somebody else they are available to use\nFor a small fee by anyone who comes along and wants to pay that small fee to use and what this does is to create a different set of social norms which is a beautiful concept in some ways because it presumably leads to less waste but\nBecause it's so novel it creates this opportunity for people to develop a set of norms about how to use them and and what we're seeing with is is that people are really\nSelfish [laughter]\nMitchell develop a bit of a norm yeah\nWhat you said about new things in an environment introducing opportunities for\nBehavior that's not practice than not learn and and Twitter is an example right I mean we've talked on previous shows about the idea that one created suddenly an opportunity for people to communicate with one another and vast numbers of people potentially\nWithout having any feedback about the reactions that they're getting from or the effects that they're causing all the people that they're broadcasting to\nNo one was used to that because they were very few people in public life who could communicate across vast swaths of other human beings\nAre so effortlessly and and so cheaply I mean for free right and there's nothing to it so ... what happened is we we reverted to many of our baser instincts I mean many people describe\nHuman behavior in a civilized society is learning how to tamp down what we've also talked about our previous shows is our short term attention to what kinds of things were going to ...\nOnto white respond to things in the very near future and long term consequences are not off and on our minds unless we learned that they should be on our mind\nNext week we'll talk about political language

minutes talking about spies specifically Russian Spies not normally there might not be that much to talk about some spy craft is supposed to be invisible but lately Russian Spies have been all over the headlines\nWe've got two stories and in a moment we're going to meet a group of investigators who have been busy on masking Russian intelligence officers\nFirst we're going to dig into these headlines about the G argue Russian military intelligence and here to help us do that as NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre eighth grade and Hi Mary Louise\nSo that you are you has been around for a century since ah around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of two G. argue agents the ledge agents who are accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had a traded ... swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all screwball and his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nAssassination attempt that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on\nThat is correct and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go ... are back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing in solitary but\nSo\nSo there are blaming their explain that solves there is this beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve their to see this tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and flashy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones right\nAnd so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced that just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents ah with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing\nThe the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March um now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow has only been used a couple of days earlier\nI'm even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were caught\nI think what we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of\nActions but what does the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions by we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officer so seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents Greg Myre thank you thank you [noise] turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no such as a conclusion other than the Russians fake who's ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference are they released passport photo so names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would suddenly underwriters says the ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge polar works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is

trade deficit goes up because we're buying a lot more from the rest of the world and trying to of course is a major supplier\nIrwin says part of the reason people are spending more as the Trump tax cuts which have put more money in people's pockets the dollar is stronger against China's currency and there's another reason that trade gap is wider when the U.S imposed tariffs on China China retaliated with tariffs of its own\nA U.S exports to China really not taken a hit particularly soybeans and other agricultural commodities when they are ... there tariffs um those exports really were stopped in their tracks\nThis dynamic could change as the year goes on the U.S is scheduled to increase tariffs on Chinese goods even more in January if trade talks with Beijing haven't yielded any results that may finally make Chinese products expensive enough that\nAmerican consumers buy fewer of them Jim Zarroli NPR News\nWith us instead of compulsively reaching for your phone ... you could reach for a book\nWe wanted it to just be this object that was this kind of comforting thing that kept people company throughout the day\nThat is Johnny son he's an illustrator who collaborated on such a companion with Lynn man well Miranda as in Hamilton Lin Manuel Miranda\nI was aware of him much earlier than he was where everybody [laughter] but eventually I think we just we started realizing that we were kind of floating in the same space and um that's sort of how we got to know each other\nThat's base was on Twitter of all places and that's basically the happy encouraging one Miranda want it to collect his daily tweets that he called the morning and night in a book he writes things such as the morning good gracious are smile is contagious and\nConnect then ... year one for the ages\nSunday we did at Miranda that he had ideas about how this book could come together and that is how Johnny son ended up illustrating around his words in their new book can morning goodnight little pet tax for me Andy you Johnny ... explains some of his thinking behind it\nThe Twitter feed and kind of social media in general is meant to be ephemeral and I think when when it moves from like on line to off line it becomes more of like this capsule or something\nAnd it's meant to be visited and it's meant to be a little more time with and I think the the difference between like the morality of social media and sort of permanence of a book was the reason to do the book\nI Love that Twitter can be memorialized tastefully [laughter]\nSo do you have a favorite illustration in this book or our favorite pairing between when a your drawings and when it lends sweet\nOh man there are so many I think the\nThe real joy of it was really working with Lynn to\nMake sure that the illustrations were reflective of him we spent some time going through each of the tweets and he kind of gave me like the director of commentary of each kind of passage\nAnd told me like here's how he was feeling this day here's what he was thinking of and um the drug for me was taking all of that stuff and trying to fit it into an image\nSo I was flipping through the book and I came across this tweet do not get stuck in the comments section of life today make do create the themes let others tough slid out\nNeither Lin Manuel Miranda words that they made me think of you because because you started your whole public persona on Twitter any by definition you were stuck in the comments section yeah ooh why Twitter why did you choose that medium to introduce yourself to the world\nIt's it's funny that they do even frame it as like choosing to do this thing because I think for me I just had turned to Twitter as this organic way to sort of connect with people\nThey had um just moved to the U. S. for school I had a a grown up in Toronto\nAnd um I realize I had lost touch with a lot of my comedy friends on a lot of my writer friends in Toronto and so I sort of turned to Twitter because I found a lot of people doing a really interesting stuff onto it or they were writing um humor and writing fiction and just sharing\nInteresting pieces and thoughts are aspect of their lives on line and I thought like this is such a great space and community to play and and I just wanted to\nI just wanted to be an optimist [laughter] I mean it seems easier dining out and say this is a vial and toxic and poison [laughter] right\nAbsolutely and like I absolutely don't mean to discount any of that because that is such a huge issue with um with Internet culture and just like the social media space in general um I I Do think\nThough that there are pockets of of genuine like goodness and I think that's that's the really hard part to find is to is to is to find those find those people and find those communities that are just people trying to connect with each other and I think that's really powerful\nYou talk about dealing with depression on Twitter were you able to find a community of people who got what you were saying dot your struggle like has Twitter helped actually deal with that part of your life\n[noise] [noise] yeah absolutely I think it's actually it's I feel like it's the other way around where like Twitter was the thing that made me understand my mental health better ... like I had not grown up knowing that therapy was an option for me\nAnd it was it was only after I got on Twitter and sort of started falling a lot of people\nAnd I saw them talking about mental health I'm really for the first time in an an stigmatized way and in a way that felt just normal and every day I realized a lot of this stuff is stuff that I feel\nAnd they started talking about therapy and\nI thought maybe this might be something that would help me and it turns out that it did help me and it turns out that um I Do suffer from anxiety and depression and um\nAll of that stuff I Would not have realized that I Would not have sort of um\nBeen able to address had it not been for signing these people on line that we're talking about it you know so yeah and so I feel like this enormous I guess responsibility to pass that forward in the hopes that it might reach someone else\nJohnny son he illustrated a new book by Lin Manuel Miranda called the good morning goodnight little pep talks for ... and ... year thank you very much for the thing that I find thank you so much for having me this is such a pleasure\n\nYou are listening to all things considered from NPR News ... support for NPR comes from this station and from PBS with the eugenics crusade\nAmerican Experience explores the history of the early twentieth century campaign to breed better American race the eugenics crusade Tuesday at nine eastern on PBS\nFrom Elijah crank family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Elijah crank large town Kentucky forty seven percent alcohol by volume Elijah crank promotes responsible drinking and from visit St Petersburg Clearwater along\nOr just Gulf Coast offering artistic draws including St Pete's Dali museum that Yahoo collection and the museum of fine arts more and visit saint Pete Clearwater dot com [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered on K.
