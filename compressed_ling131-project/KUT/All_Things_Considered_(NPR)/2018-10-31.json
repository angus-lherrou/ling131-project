identity politics throughout my campaign and it was just sort of um\nAn assumption that my message was not appealing to or that my work had not been to the benefit of a broad and diverse coalition of many people and that was hurtful because that is a a play out of the G O P handbook\nNot a charge that would have expected to be lobbied against me by Democrats and certainly not people that consider

Bush\nBut he was known for spontaneous moments like right after nine eleven there was this moment where he was standing on the rebel at ground zero the twin towers were still smoldering in the background and he grabs a Baltimore\nWhere the president was there to tour the ruins and looking around with that sense that we all have butter helplessness someone showed how\nWe can hear you [noise] and the president had been trying to hurt but he suddenly heard that\n[laughter]\nPart of what made which is spontaneous remarks such a hit and so much history was because he addressed this issue of retribution revenge to avenge was with the country was\nThirsty for but sometimes and more often a president's address at a moment like this is also responsive to what people are feeling but he's calling\nFor forgiveness I'm thinking about President Obama shortly after the shooting at Emanuel AME church in Charleston in twenty Fifteen he breaks into song during the University of\nOne of the ... [noise] [noise]\nAh\nAh [noise]\nHe was so moved that literally first song in that fashion and of course counting on the ...\n\nI mean these are moments that really drawn out thing different kinds of leadership skills in Egypt he's president\nAt times of national tragedy the nation as in the habit of looking for someone to play the role of sympathetic parent if you will someone to provide reassurance empathy uplift we want someone to organize our grief for us rally our spirits and begin the process of healing\nLet's talk now about how President Trump has tried to sell this role\nAfter some of the hurricanes that we've had during his presidency President Trump has gone to the site in Texas and Florida Puerto Rico and has tried to represent the country and the country's\nEmbrace of these victims at times this worked at other times it's been quite awkward particularly in Puerto Rico and then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in twenty Seventeen equating or some people felt he was drawn up by the quibbling between some of the people who came to\nTo rally as white supremacist as white nationalist to Nazis and the people who came to protest that route\nI think the blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it either\nDo you think this way that Trump react in times of tragedy do think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react or is he just kind of use uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic controller\nIn fairness public shows of empathy or not President Trump's strong suit he he did not promised that sort of a presidency when he ran\nLet's face it he has a great talent for bonding with rally audiences and it's just less comfortable for him to acknowledge the sorrowful details of a tragedy such as Pittsburgh and far less comfortable for him to you to critics who urging toward introspection\nBut should president be judged if they're not good at consoling the country in times of tragedy\nNo president should be judged solely on that one particular part of his role that he has least control of book there are going to be those people who are going to feel that the president should be able to provide something at a moment such as this that goes beyond a political observation\nAnd address the nation's needs and hunger at the level

gay says that will be especially beneficial for people stop for public intoxication because it makes them eligible to be taken to the city's new sobering center instead of to jail\nNot only can

impact\nAwesome place will be tracking the results of these changes and making regular reports to city council\nPlenty of attention has been paid to the U.S Senate race between Republican incumbent

this NPR station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I noticed that Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races\nBillions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects at a total of high point two billion dollars will be spent during the entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion some compare to previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand part team that's at thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now TV\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that a almost a billion dollars has been sent already this cycle on media\nWay uh uh from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media or advertising on TV for the competitive races I digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook yeah here it's through the roof\nThis year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen or election cycle for a lot of actors are so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a\nIt's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd he said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence I think both\nCome into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters in other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling a by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state that represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it\nReally counts so that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that some ... de Presse voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate says those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races\nSheila Krumholz is the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nFor us has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting

good for them and it's a message that they've been pushing all along\nIs not something that just popped up now on dysfunction they concede that uh people say they want a check and balance but they are trying to argue is the check and balance you want that when it comes to Democrats\nOf course President Trump is not on the ballot but he is on the campaign trail and on a lot of people's minds to see seem to be a plus or a minus for the midterm elections for Republicans right now\nDepends on which election you're talking about right in the Senate probably he is because the landscape and the Senate just favors Republicans so strongly\nYou know in places like Indiana West Virginia Tennessee in Texas where Republicans really should do well and they need that base to come out but in places like Arizona and Nevada it's not really clear that he is\nAnd you know ... and Democrats really need their base out there and they're happy to let President Trump talk and they think is suppress vote a among some of his base but also hurt with\nIndependence or you know but the fact that Republicans are in a vice overall even in the house they need Trump's base but he turns off independents and women in the suburbs and it really hurts them a down ballot in those key key house races\nI also want to ask you about young voters because traditional leaves her mid term voter has been a little bit older than the voter and a presidential year up but this year we saw a huge youth marches against gun violence of do you think that we're going to see a different kind of turn out next week\nWell look we're expecting to see a record turnout you know something that could be as the highest turn out in the last fifty years or so so that could really fundamentally reshaped what we're talking about here at the same time younger voters\nAre still lagging behind some of those other groups older white voters in particular who still say that they're fired up that they want to go vote\n'em you know they don't traditionally turn out in big numbers in mid terms\nYou know what kind what kind of effect does this discussion of civility have on them I mean on the one hand\nMany young voters in particular disaffected with politics but UC millennials kind of take matters into their own hands with like online fundraising for causes that are important to them on the other we saw young voters really get involved and animated speaking out on gun violence after Parkland so you know do they turn out for that\nCompares to medical mom tomorrow thanks tobacco You're welcome\n[noise] it is time to start
