the key messages here is that the United states really asks them for you that doesn't mean breaking relations ending economic card\nIgnoring our security and ... but I think it does mean that both the media and outlaws and government in the United states and was ruining they could go up on this incident\nAnd make it clear to every one in the area that this kind of operation is going to get government officials involved into very deep international Trump\nDo you see any indication that this administration or leaders in Congress are inclined to send that message\nI think that one has to be very careful right now or Asians are so bad in some ways\nOn a part of some level that people have a norm what President Trump is sad unless they have done it was taught as an unacceptable and I think it's ... like Claire already ... members of Congress both are single this out as a key issue one where Armstrong's first ties to Saudi Arabia\nCould be serious way effect and it's clear that there might be some kind of actual limits through Armstrong's first to Saudi Arabia but I think the problem here is\nThat there is a reason why we're showing restraint this is the largest oil exporter in the world it affects the security stability grows I'll go with me\nIt is a key power in terms of dealing with Iran and the problem is not to sever relations it is to reshape in ways where it is clear on both at the expectations that I think our normal in the international community after being applied in Saudi Arabia's while\nThat's Anthony Cordesman he's with the center for Strategic and International Studies he's the former national security system to Senator John McCain he's written many many books\nThe middle east and he's consulted with both the state department and the defense

called caravan of folks who hope to get to the U.S border and eventually into the U.S reporter Emily Green has been traveling with him and she is now under a bridge that separate square miles from Mexico and she's with us now Emily thanks so much for talking to us as having\nA little bit more about where you are and what's happening\nRight now so I'm On this reds I had that had lights on Mexico and without saying right now are\nThey just in their diapers kids without shoes on tons of men and moms it feels like I'm In the midst of a humanitarian crisis\nCan you just tell us a bit more about what people are telling you who they are and why they've been willing to go through all this so most of them\nCame from Hunter S and there are so folks from El Salvador and some from Guatemala but the vast majority of undress what they told me largely is that this was that land they read or heard about the caravan\nAnd conditions and in Honduras are on the bad that they can't get past that there is no food that they're they're simply\nStarving and that they had to take a chance they also felt much safer and numbers to travel to Mexico as part of the group of people instead of just a loan or hang a smuggler or coyote to take them\nNow understand that a number of people are actually turning back now\nThat's right so Guatemala has sent buses to take a those migrants who want to return for hundreds of take them back voluntarily and so I talked to a woman by the name of Rosalind outlook as as you name as she's twenty six years old\nShe said like many of the other migrants that she started at joined the caravan as an uncomfortable position but but she was granted the decision along the way\nShe has four children back in Honduras and she said she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than she imagine\nSilver in may that they're not what she said to me she'll suffer back and under us but at least she'll keep her life and she refers to the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas against migrants tried them from Mexico and that people got hurt and so she says given the condition it's better that she returned to Honduras\nBut you said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and move on to keep moving with the ...\nThat's right up until this point I mean I'd say there's maybe two to three thousand people on the spread most of them are moving\nForward I talked to a twenty four year old I haven't had um India is traveling with his younger sister and a friend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrants 'em and they want to reach Florida with their friends here's what he had to tell me\nYou know the the way\nHe says fear becomes your friend so if you become scared you use that to your to your favor and it pushes you forward and he says they're going to try and get it costs of Mexico anyway they had and that includes by boat or trying to cross that spreads that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this he's been speaking about it a campaign rally demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claimed to send us troops to the southern border I I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what sense do you have from all the both the markets and the authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on the spreads really know what time is saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically word of mouth they know Trump doesn't want them they absolutely do that but that's almost meaningless to them what they want to do is leave\nTheir lives they're they're very hard they are very violent life behind and on tourists are so they're going to push forward but\nI have this sense today on the bridge that this is not going to end a well I don't have the sense that all of a sudden Mexico is going to let these three thousand people in 'em and so it makes me wonder what's gonna happen to them that this is this is going to turn further into humanitarian crisis where these people are going to go I don't think it's going to end well\nEmily Green is a reporter based in Mexico and she's with us
