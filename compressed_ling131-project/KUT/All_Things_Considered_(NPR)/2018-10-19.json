Will Stone who covers health care there Well hi Elsa\nSo you know we see a lot of issue ads about health care throughout the state including one that ... gene started but what candidates actually saying about health care on the campaign trail Democrats\nAre certainly framing it as a choice between two very different visions of health care and another referendum on the Affordable CARE Act\nThat voters can expect a GOP to do what they tried to do last year or repeal the healthcare law I'm In this narrative is kind of forcing Republicans to take what I call more defensive posture\nUh it's very much on display in our tight Senate race between Democrats have been the defense of ones for the past eight years but you think it's Republicans now that is seems to be what's happening right now I mean if you just look at the race between Democrat gears didn't cinema\nUm she's using that line of attack against her Republican opponent Martha mix Sally and you know in response from ... how to kind of soften moderate her stance on the issue saying we cannot go back to where we were before the CIA that we need to fix the law and protect people with preexisting conditions\nAnd so for me I think it shows the to win a statewide race in Arizona which before the AC I had one of the highest rates in the country\nLike make Sally need to reassure voters\nThat they support certain key provisions of the healthcare law and not just a full repeal so you don't get the sense that the mantra repeal and replace resonates anymore in the states not so much and you can see that you know in the political races and a lot of the concern revolves around Medicaid\nArizona expanded Medicaid under the AC a and we had a lot of people who needed coverage so there was a big rush joined the program that was at risk under the GOP bill and people in Arizona like the state's Medicaid program a Republican moderates like the program it functions well\nSo no one wanted to see that a damaged or cut\nAnd that's where those who shop for insurance plans on the marketplace they say they want more options cheaper plans lord a duck to bowls but they do not want to see a full overhaul\nYeah on on more options you know we heard current Bobby said that she was hoping to have more choices in terms of health insurance during the next open enrollment season that starts next month what does it look like I mean it looked like there will be more options for the state\nIs looking remarkably better of the market has stabilized at its rebounded health experts I talked to said will be more options and it's really one of the more resilient are examples in the country of the marketplace it's working that kj these Will Stone thank you very much well thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\nYou're listening to K U T Ninety forty five\nPresident Trump says he could consider sanctions against Saudi Arabia over missing Saudi journalist ...

Jay has disappeared Turkish investigators are presenting all kinds of evidence that Mike Pompeo said he's found anything out he's found any facts at this point\nNow in ... in fact it was this down there because we it was as we were leaving Riad we asked him point blank ... get the Saudis tell you that left Washington Post columnist was dead yeah what they say he said\nAnd I it really was interesting to think about how much we envision ourselves\nBy the metaphors we use to describe our motivations are our actions are beliefs\nAnd when when we think about things like you know how do you define yourself are you a part of what's holding something back are you part of what's pushing something forward and that kind of metaphorical language influences the way we make decisions about how to act\nYeah and and so and I think what's important about this has to recognize a not so much the current political environment but but\nThe influence that that particular metaphor has on the options that you think are available to you\nSo um if we take the notion of resistance for example so resistance assumes if you just think about uh about about the concept of resistance in general\nThat there's some force that's moving in a particular direction and the thing that is resisting God force is impeding the motion of that in some way and so\nWhen you cast\nYour yourself as a member of a resistance now what you're saying is there is some force in the world often a social for some time perhaps the government perhaps it's the\nUh some other social movement and and it is ... the assumption is that it is driving the the uh it is the engine of change\nAnd by being a resistance to that it is your job to stop\nThat change well what is that what does that\nInfluence in terms of the actions you're willing to take well it suggests that someone else is setting the agenda and that your job is to forward that agenda that the most obvious statement for you to make at any given moment is no\nAnd uh and and that that your job is not constructive but destructive yeah in the sense of trying to dismantle the the apparatus that is creating the force that's moving against him\nAnd and so that in ... the importance of that analysis is that if you recast the kind of metaphor that you use\nYou may then recognize that there are other options at your disposal at that moment that might enable a very different set of actions have very different approach to the very ...\nIt's a great point yeah yeah and and I I think all of us if we think about our own self concept I mean what we imagine ourselves as being you know or are we the person who's ... who's facilitating something or with the people who's keeping something bad from happening those kinds of things [noise]\nI think art makes a really important point about what kind of options for action or inaction a are available to us based on that definition and it is interesting to consider how much\nJust a word or two can actually to find so much about a situation precisely\nFor the reason that we use metaphors to begin with right they they have a lot of meaning packed into them already and then when we assigned them to some other thing that they've not yet been associated with all those meanings come along for the ride right so when we think about resistance as art just beautifully explained to something that's\nStopping or so at least slowing some moving force it already has some momentum but that's one way of thinking about things but what what to me has been such an interesting thing to observe about the way we human beings use language is it not only reflects what we already think\nBut changing our language in a deliberate way can actually change the way we think because of all of those definitions that the words we use metaphorically carry with them\nAnd I and many of this much of this is\nProbably unwitting on on most people's parts most of the time but it's certainly can be mustard and in a purposeful way to actually bring about changes of thinking and ultimately changes in people's behavior\nWhen a particular group\nUses a particular way of describing a situation because those words create a social reality they also bind together the members of that community who then recognize fellow members of that community by the use of a common language\nTo the extent though that that that that language is language that other people also find expressive for things that they're experiencing which may be very different from what the first community experiencing\nThey may choose to use that same language and that can create a tremendous amount of\nTension because now you have a community that says wait a second we meant a particular thing by what we were saying\nAnd you you shouldn't be using our language because you're you're a member of a different group and now you're ... you know it almost be like if suddenly one football team adopted the jerseys of the other team people say that you can't do that we can't now we can't tell her we can't tell ourselves apart anymore and by dressing up your\nWhat you're saying and the same language that someone else was using it can be very disconcerting in ways that may ultimately lead the initial group to stop using that language yeah because now they feel like those words no longer express the concept that they intended\nThere are people who will deliberately try to didn't take language and subverted demeaning yeah as a way of trying to take the teeth out of what someone else is doing\nYou know I think it's easy to to Penn nefarious motives yeah on on others and sometimes that is undoubtedly true that people do things in order to mess with you but I also think that there are plenty of times in which\nPeople are are doing things\nDifferently I felt on their own turn right around that still may rankled\nYou next week we'll talk about why\nHave gotten to the doctor I meant to David

Wisconsin\nUm these are states where Trump made a lot of games and the Democrats are bouncing back Senator Sherrod Brown in Ohio was way ahead as a Democrat I'm Richard Cordray the Democrat running for governor isn't a very tight race a Democrats are doing quite well in Wisconsin and Michigan I think\nOn election night we're really going to learn a lot about how strong Trump's whole is on these key states if those states goes south\nOn Trump or the whole operation is in a grave trouble and the Democrats were short doing better uh this year than people would have predicted two days after the twenty sixteen election\nMargaret would you agree with that Democrats doing a lot better than might have been predicted\n... well they are doing very well and it is likely that they'll take back the house of representatives you look at every single poll right now uh but you know\nLeaving the generic ballot the generic ballot averages Democrats leading Republicans by you know the low end eight percent of the high end fourteen percent so\nThat is a not historically a surprise uh it is typical for the president any new president to lose seats in the house of representatives and after that first uh election cycle\nBut they've proportion and the extent may actually end up being historic All right let me turn your two\nTotally different topic uh the case of Jamal ... says of course the missing\nLikely murdered Saudi journalist a President Trump just this afternoon said for the first time he's open to considering sanctions against Saudi Arabia if it turns out that they were behind this but he continues to stress Saudi Arabia is a great ally of the U.S that we need to wait for an investigation which he says we may know more about by Monday\nMargaret why the reluctance to call up the Saudis\nYou know Donald Trump wants to have it both ways right he he wants to be able to put his arm around ... ...\nSay wouldn't it be great if we could all just get along with Russia they have no incentive to intervene in our election and then he also wants to be a tough guy on the world stage and not be ... ...\nEh it's it's very difficult to understand the reasoning or that the rhyme or reason behind a desk other than what's on the faces this was his first diplomatic play as a president in the United states has first international trip or a wide range of Saudi Arabia and he put his arms around Mohammed bin ...\nAt this is at\nFrankly it was encouraging I think to the secretary ammunition pull out of the Saudi Arabian bath in conference the treasury secretary who was all set to go to Saudi Arabia right at and and but then again you've got these mixed messages from the Trump Administration or you have secretary ...\nGoing to Saudi Arabia and hang out we're going to need more time what we really look too and hope for and I'm hopeful though so the Republican leadership in Congress also\nReinforcing this idea that a Saudi Arabia must not be allowed to get away with murder ringing American resident and a journalist\nA full\nFull stop alright EJ jump on that first up and I want to ask you about something that the Washington Post your newspaper was writing about today and it's a whisper\nCampaign among hard line Republicans conservative commentators against cooked to show to yeah the the the ... that they seem to be highlighting his his association with Muslim Brotherhood in his youth [laughter] what's going on here\nWell first of all it's disgusting uh and imagine someone saying spreading\nA stories like this about soccer officials in each and the great ... you know Soviet the Soviet ...

G\nSaudi Arabia has confirmed on state TV that he is dead ... had been missing since October second that's when he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Seventeen Days ago\nMultiple news reports had pointed to his likely death but this marks the first official confirmation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter\nI'm Mary Louise what details do we have from the Saudi announcement\nOf very few details of the Saudi press agency is saying uh Eighteen people have been arrested or the investigation is ongoing or but as you mentioned there is the first official confirmation\nOr from Riyadh that jump off the show gee uh is did he was last seen going into the Saudi cubs to live here in Istanbul on October ... seconds\nAnd according to the Saturday press agency after he entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\n[noise] study TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal\nCourt advisor who've been sacked from their positions do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general up that Syria was first mentioned uh to my knowledge in a New York times report this morning that talked about\nA him as someone who might be being lined up to take the blame for this a lot of questions have been pointing of course at the royal family a including a crown prince Mohammed bin some on as the man who was in pretty much total control of Saudi Arabia\nAnd of many folks have been saying that this probably could not have happened without his knowledge and possibly without his order\nA but at this point the Saudis are saying that this intelligence officer an advisor to sell them on a has been sacked and also said good Tony who's an advisor\nTo the real court so possibly a strategy to to uh put some scapegoats out there and the questions were made in terms of who was giving the orders for this operation\nLet me ask you this Peter what do we know about timing why put this out in the middle of the night there from Saudi Arabia\nI Can't answer that really um there have been a exhilarating investigation certainly and the pressure\nHas been growing a after initially uh being rather cool to the whole idea of President Trump has been a saying there will be severe punishment if the Saudis are found to have been behind this\nAnd it seems as if there is a move in Riyadh no uh to to move ahead with this and not continue with their initial statement which seemed to be more and more untenable\nPosition as they did the Saudis statement tonight explain in any way how what they're saying now is completely different from what they were saying two weeks ago\nThat's not explained a but it is completely different the original explanation has been um he walked into the cost of lives he needed some paperwork he walked out within an hour and we don't know what happened to them that has been the official on the record deposition ever since this happened on October\nSecond ah and we have seen a these investigation move\nForward poking more and more potential holes in that story and making it look less and less tenable and now a very late at night the Saudis have come out with an official statement admitting yes he's dead we have these people under arrest and we'll just to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis this was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet yes some libraries that have been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right and that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David Cay he has the United nations special repertoire on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked\nWith protecting those very rights around the world cave has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of\n... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nUh of ... killing and\nMessenger only got close enough to sea ice that the north pole but Chabot says the real icy action is that the south pole\nThe largest crater to host these water ice deposits is right smack dab at the south pole of mercury and so I'm very excited that that'd be Colombo is going to be in an orbit that passes much closer to the southern hemisphere\nThat'd be Colombo was an Italian scientist after whom the European space agency mission is named it's actually two probes one that will orbit the planet close up and another supplied by the Japanese space agency that will be further out measuring Mercury's magnetic field\nThere's one feature on mercury Chabot is particularly curious about the crater made by messenger at the end of its mission messenger managers decided to crash the spacecraft into the planet\nOnce ... Colombo gets into orbit they should be able to take the highest resolution image they possibly can and we might be able to see messengers final resting spot\nIt's more than a sentiment that makes Chabot curious about the crash site\nThe impact will undoubtedly you've tossed up lots of debris and we might be able to learn something about that freshly explicit material and more about mercury that'd be Colombo will take seven years to reach mercury\nIt flies once by earth twice by Venus and six times by mercury before it's in the right orientation to go into orbit around the hot little

interview on CBS Sunday Morning she was answering this question about her husband\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power no\nBecause she said Lewinsky a twenty two year old intern at the time was an adult that echoed the position that Bill Clinton took earlier this year when he was asked about the affair on the today show\nThis we would go to ... years ago for the American people saw it with me\nThat is true two thirds of Americans at the time said Clinton should not be removed from office that the charges didn't justify it [noise]\nWell what the country feel the same way today and how does Bill Clinton sex scandal of two decades ago continue to shape political culture today Susan Glasser oversaw the Washington Post's coverage of Bill Clinton's impeachment and now she writes the letter from Washington column for the New Yorkers Susan Glasser thanks for coming in thank you so much\nYou started at the post one week before the Lewinsky story broke\nOne week before the Lewinsky story invoke exactly I was supposed to be the deputy national editor in charge of investigation so at the time that was the Clinton fundraising scandal now mostly forgotten in the annals of history\nAnd when the Lewinsky story broke how did you all initially think about framing it we're kind of story was\nWell it was a political earthquake and I remember standing slap Todd in the post newsroom along with you know hundreds of other journalists\nWhen President Clinton came out and said you know I did not have sex without ... without even and in hindsight it seems more clear cut what the outcome is going to be but there were certainly moments when we felt along the way that the Clinton presidency with hanging in the balance\n[noise] I've been going back for some of the Post's coverage of the times and trying to reconcile what you were writing with what I remember feeling I'm Around the same age as Monica Lewinsky and I'm struck when I look back at how women of my generation didn't rally around\nHer the culture has shifted and you know as a woman in many ways I'm sure you know you and I both\nWelcome many of the changes and the revelations have the last year about sexual exploitation of women harassment of women in the workplace and this unfortunately was not reflected in either the politics or the culture of that moment it was at\nA sexist environment in Washington in some ways that are still true today and some ways that thank goodness are are not\nFeel really of a different time way I look back at it now setting aside things the Clintons have shed in this last year it was really Donald Trump who\nPlayed a big role in rejecting the Clinton sex scandals in to the national political debate at the second presidential debate he brought Clinton's accusers\nMr Trump might have said that\nJuanita broader speaking right before walking into the presidential debate to sit in the audience with Paula Jones and other Clinton accusers\nSusan Glasser the read on that was Trump was wheeling out Clinton's accusers in order to deflect from the Access Hollywood tape in order to deflect attention from his own accusers did it work\n[noise] well I think Trump has learned a lot from how Bill Clinton survived the impeachment scandal and raising it out\nAnd denying or telling the truth slowly you know Trump did use the female accusers of Bill Clinton to shield himself I guess that he knew correctly that Democrats would be accused of being hypocrites that has continued to be the case throughout\nThe subsequent me to revelations which took place after that twenty sixteen campaign and many people myself included\nBelieve that part of that sort of national furor over the meat to stories has been a response in some ways to the fact that there is another male president in the oval office who has been credibly accused of misconduct by numerous women in Trump's case I Believe it's Nineteen when\nDo you think Bill Clinton would have survived the Lewinsky scandal\nIf it unfolded today you know that is the question I Will say that the Democratic party has shifted\nPublicly at least more than the Republican Party when it comes to what to do about members in their own ranks who are accused of this kind of wrongdoing look at how quickly they abandon Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota\nYou know maybe that would have happened with Bill Clinton maybe not\n[noise] do you think it serves a purpose to reckon with Bill Clinton's legacy at this point where does it leave us or is it time to let it go\nWell I Do think Donald Trump's continued mentioning of the Clintons at every turn suggests how useful part is in\nFoil it is at this hyper partisan time you know there's some truth to Bill Clinton's point that we have litigated this issue two decades ago and to me the fact that it does keep requiring is largely a reflection of the fact that we're grappling as a country with the unique\nPresidents have Donald Trump and the many allegations of wrongdoing towards him Susan Glasser now a columnist at the New Yorker thanks so much

NPR's diplomatic correspondent thanks to both thank you [noise]\nLet me bring now NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith a forest sense of how the president and the rest of his administration might respond to tonight's near as high town high any reaction yet from the White House\nNo not yet do we could hear from the president's soon he has a rally tonight in Arizona but he has a couple of events before that and he has been a chatty a earlier today he talked to the press a he said uh\nHe was asked about this but it was before the news came out uh and uh he said he was still waiting then for an investigation to be completed\nSomething we don't live\nVery serious\nAnd we're going to go to the bottom of it\nMorning hours involved determining what to do\nAnd we haven't heard from a lot of members of Congress yet but one who\nHas spoken out is Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina of late has been a very close ally of the president he\nTweeted quote to say that I'm skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr ... ... is an understatement that President Trump had been asked whether sanctions would be on the table if Saudi Arabia was found to be responsible or he said they could be\nThey could be but he also today's keeps reminding people of the importance of the the relationship with Riyadh\nHow Saudi Arabia is a is a very close ally with the United states has been at pains throughout this episode or two to stress look we have to view this in the wider context of the relationship right\nYes and and even today he said that um you know this is a real sad situation he said because Saudi Arabia has been such a great ally um he in particular I he President Trump is known to be quite transactional and uh and Saudi Arabia has committed\nSome deals with the United states President Trump keeps talking about them in our investigation they use\nArms deals he keeps talking about millions in our ...\nAnd other private investment in the U.S economy um those deals as we've looked in the end of them are not as big or insurance thing is the president makes them out to be but certainly Saudi Arabia and investment in the United states it continues to be significant\nThe president has said ah whoever's responsible there should be severe punishment that's that's his words now that Saudi Arabia has confirmed the death and detained Eighteen people do we have a sense what's the range of options that the Trump Administration might check well\nSanctions are the thing that are being discussed a but they could take many forms they could be quite targeted as they could be more symbolic\nUh and and it also really depends on Congress Congress in the past is at least on one occasion a force the administration's hand on sanctions related to Moscow's electoral meddling um they could do it again but it but it's not clear whether the attention span is there in Congress and\nBriefly tell him to Trump's comment that this could be a this could be real killers I mean there's still no direct link here to Mohammed ... leadership\nUh not yet and uh I in some ways it seems like President Trump would would prefer that that not be the case at least in the
