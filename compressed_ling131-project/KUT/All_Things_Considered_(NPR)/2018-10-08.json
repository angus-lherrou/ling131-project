{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "In Rio de Janeiro head back to hear from Tim on our top stories a result of the first round of the presidential election in Brazil\nIs still missing it's even to show you both in the far right candidate stumped the rest of the few getting forty six percent of the vote just shy B. fifty percent needed for victory in the first round of the presidential election\nEqually it was a humiliating night for the left wing workers' party and indeed many of the other is coverage pistol parties in Congress\nThat would cause policy candidate Fernando ... contest the rental for the presidency having taken a much more slender twenty nine percent of advice on Sunday Jake Scott ... is a senior strategist and started to work as far as he\nDon't chase him busy freewheeling today\nI wouldn't say that the present at work is by his one of the biggest losers of this election but we lost\nIt's going to be ... impossible though isn't it for you just in the pure max to become this gap\nTo get to fifty percent\nThe second round in Brazil it's the kind of new election so all the both candidates will face the Brazilian people\nJay both so narrow has not debate to uh I feel that we feel that people don't know why he stand\nFor you but I'm grateful for that is because he was stopped well there are other ways to talk and if you read his program for example he talks about like a very small states and if you talk to people on the streets for example do you know what that does that mean\nLess health less bubbly education less investment in infrastructure less jobs in our opinion\nIf you took speak on the street they will also say that they really hold the workers' party in contempt for the amount of crime the metro corruption for the state of the economy I haven't heard anything from people close to what this puppy suggesting that they understand that level of anger\nI think the president work aspire to have to pass a difference than now and the second round to talk to people more thoroughly\nJust purely campaigning to him so do you expect that was a risk the backside horribly to have this campaign saying that you will candidates dodgy he's a man who is in prison and then\nYou and a lot of people think that he shouldn't be in prison but he's in prison serving twelve years for money laundering and corruption\nAnd you'll campaign slogan was ... he's potentially\nI think a lot of people know Lula and not many people knew what dodgy so over there are a lot of people hate literature as well a lot of people hate Lula but a lot of people love Lola we have to understand that that day is the biggest part in\nBrazil today still with more than twenty percent of people supporting it\nAnd we have to regain trust from people who lost trust on us and we have to do that the less next two weeks and have to work hard to discuss dropped an idea that it's based on fake news Cindy ... information is information\nAs represented by ah Jerry Buss narrow\nBut in order to attract the huge number of people the remaining vote was to get a fifty cent mark you want to have to distance yourself from former president later on\nWe have now to talk as well about how we gain support from other\n... who can join us and to try to defeat backwardness that gave us an Arab presents in Brazil would\nIt mean if Mr Wilson already became president\nIt'd be green I I think we it's difficult to imagine what would have been a he's a figure that base his a political campaign on hate against minorities\nI smaller stage which something that most people don't understand what it is and why do fear and international level as well how would be his stand against Venezuela against our neighbors Brazil has a very traditional way does not interfere with other countries and and I hear that\nThis could escalate to regional violence as well or some sort of lacking security international security within the ridge\nWas Jake Scott voting if he's a senior stress just inside the workers' party still with me is professor color Herrera a political scientist here in Rio\nA professor ... ... to ... go to any of the strategy ... may be taking a different approach how far is it the case actually to send to the ground which you might imagine the work of what he might go towards here in Brazil the evidence of this election is that the central ground has collapsed\nIn fact true you know it was a huge about lemon ... electoral tsunami\nAnd the name of the ... and older traditional parties including the center have you know declined dramatically but something that would like to dispute and we'd the previews and he you know yes ... is related to the idea that\nThis ... election of someone who is conservative who has a very you know ... she means necessarily that review we're gonna change dramatically you know\nAnd Brazil has a very sophisticated the Web comes to ... you know they should be shared is very ... subject persecute yours quoted ports have very strong free media\nSo old does he see patients we work as a kind of neat to as a kind of you know end up stop was full and dramatic change that would deviate too much ... for the meeting preference of\nThis will say they work at the moment but one of the criticisms that his liberal to one of the consensus that would have ... votes in the north of men who certainly would it here to democratic norms and just say that says he is the result of much room in a tree dictatorship is not something I think to Brazil could returns stuff\nYeah these are these ... lots of conflicts\nBut I Do believe that these dishes that we have him release nowadays are strong enough to resist and the show limits set boundaries in college and a president who are tempted to deviate from what may be ... their legal would be and restricted\nAnd being reframing if the government tries to go ahead to push for these agenda\nWould be the reason for the new government itself you know we had previous examples of president that we have illegal activity with their ... call of the ... January ... news do my whole staff so they have been in Egypt legally and according to the procedures to the rules of the game so\nIf well so now does not behave according to the rules of the game you have to pay high price as well\nNoticed Herrera professor of political science division to be a vote of his foundation here in ... thank you very much\nWell Jamie or even talking about the uh the sorry the studio this year I'm familiar with in London perhaps being the most inspiring or if it's any consolation hates me filling with Robin grey rainy here at ... I can see says the sand I can see palm trees\nNonetheless Brazil looks like it's entering new territory\n... doesn't quite believe for Tim in Rio but that brings us to an end of this edition of the program for the James camaros somebody from Tim on the team in Brazil thanks very much for listening until tomorrow goodbye [noise]\nWhen my daughter was two years old going to daycare here at University of Texas\nA her brother was born\nAnd we call him a tia after my dad since my dad was already a two year my son became baby a teacher\nAnd my daughter's daycare teacher asked us one day what is your son's name we think we hear cowardly saying about the tea which\nAre a perfect being Texas Harris Teeter you couldn't ask for anything\nHe said it's it's baby but we started calling my son's baby the baby\nIn Arabic cultures you also refer to parents that your children so I Am a tea and my wife is and the tea or\nSo when you add that component to baby brother tia I Am now a baby\nMy name is ...\nWhere she can always call me a couple of baby by the end you're listening to K.

Chang we're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food into us taking a calculated risk\nCountry was growing people were moving into cities and industrialized nation Gaye food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWith fake re back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever\nThat's author Deborah Blum her new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talk with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking ... someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one daring men seeking to sort of stretch their profits would Senate with water\nIt wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which was pond water pond water pond water and and and there was a notice when the family found worms wiggling in the bottom\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you thin\nThe milk you add to reconstituted in all kinds of weird ways what shocked us than a ...\nThey look we're a coal tar dies and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab declined to make it more gold and again instead of kind of grayish are bluish and then because it was prone to rock to this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives in it and the most popular one was formaldehyde which isn't embalming compound which is not good for humans to ingest no and so you actually go out and can sing newspaper headlines around the country during this period\nWas embalmed milk scandals\nSo along comes to protecting us your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture why did he care so much about this issue [noise]\nI always thought of him as kind of a how holy roller cameras right you of Harvey Washington while he was the son of itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry and the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemists that the U.S department of agriculture I mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of cameras that he commanded if the department of agriculture was it on food safety he took up that cause\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from project which he undertook to really just shows whose commitment to this ah describe it the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture especially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that age three for three meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals are cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives\nAnd the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing suspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea\nI'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so\nDifficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHas been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point the widely starts these experiments and now\nI Do you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there and if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch national attention which they did they were front page news\nThere were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's

T. dot org it's five o'clock\nAll over the country or rallies\nLoving that man and loving ... said that in Trump's take credit for winning the bitter fight over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court it's Monday October eighth and this is all things considered\nI Know that change this hour we look at how fallout from Kavanaugh's confirmation could reshape the mid term election they take in the house has already bay but I really think the biggest impact is going to be felt in the Senate also secretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a trip to Asia\nThey talk to North Korea seemed promising but when he stopped over in Beijing Chinese officials had tough words for the U.S\nAnd the pop star Taylor Swift was long silent on politics until yesterday she changed course to endorse to Tennessee Democrats honestly\nAnd an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me any more that's really a surprise to me now that he's\nI think in most cases the way that a lot of these moderate Democrats voted is when I can make it harder for Democrats efforts to take the majority\nThe one vote that probably helped Democrats was when Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for ... that probably help solidify his effort to get reelected\nBut Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota Claire McCaskill of Missouri those are two more moderate Democrats who voted against Kevin how you think that will hurt their chances come November yes\nI mean I think especially high kept in North Dakota was already probably trailing in her race she is not getting a very good reception at home about her vote against Kavanaugh so I think it makes it harder for her to get reelected\nIn Missouri Claire McCaskill talents on some votes in rural areas to put her over the top I think that this vote against having all will cost her those rural votes\nLet's turn to the house now where Democrats would need to pick up twenty three seats to control the chamber suburban women were already expected to play a very large role in determining those contests but how do you think this fall out from Kavanaugh might amplify\nThat I think a lot of the cake in the house has already bake Republicans or help somewhat by new enthusiasm in their base a lot of the data we've seen shows that Democrats will now committed to this mid term almost a record level so the question Democrats have\nIs how much more growth do they have in that boat what is their ceiling or had they hit it already huh\nSo what they're more concerned about is\nHow much this energizes the Republican vote\nI mean obviously the Supreme Court confirmation and is still raw in people's memories now I have and I was just seated on the court this weekend more ceremonial lead today could we be overstating the influence of his confirmation this November because we're in this moment now\nAnd other issues like health care for instance could actually come to the forefront come November\nI Do not think we're overstating the impact I'm not sure a

think that this has truly angered and frightened a lot of women on many levels so I think that women are ... gauge as they were I think that they are just a lot angrier about it\n[noise] Jennifer Duffy is senior editor at the cook Political Report thank you very much\nThank you for having me\n...\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has been in Asia for the last few days he spent several hours and telling young with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un they talked about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and scheduling second meeting with President Trump called it a good trip\nThen he was in Beijing Today and that visit was notably not as good\nChinese foreign minister ... had some sharp words for ... about the state of U.S China relations NPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now Hampton he hated males so what exactly was set in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical to us from China\nWill whiny really started out on a pretty harsh note saying that the U.S said constantly escalated trade and tensions with China it harmed China's interest in regards to Taiwan and it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies wanting noticed\nThat compare would come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek that China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid pay a respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said to us and China were in fundamental disagreement on lungs points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with the speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign effort to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights the treatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy would Chinese officials take such a fence at my speech if the vast majority of what you were saying substantively it steps the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome pales making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically means China is one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude you know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this is this depiction of China is really a rogue regime in one of the top threats to us security that\nThat has to be dealt with harshly I really think that that's the tone that China is reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials have been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical uh when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's tough stance with China hurt the U.S has ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nOr well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors is not just the north Korea issue\nThat the U.S needs China's help on it's it's just so many issues of global importance but to us seems to want to put a competition with China in front of cooperation on these local issues\nAll right That's NPR's Anthony Kuhn thank you very much Anthony

Chang mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party many presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and she knows it and NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything that Democrats\n[noise] they're then\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a prime all over the place you're going to people across the border to lose your rights to those guns you can ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to jump in June Venezuela\nEven for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president last midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the son it's a catastrophe\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nIf you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved within the house the big the big problem will be the judge just shove and ... of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the been God's the investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's are is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to help voters\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are reelected to the majority of the nation of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get is America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to try like which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies on particular issues but we're talking about climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago\nAnd so do you regret it would be you know an ugly was not fun or\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did with Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever shows that you'd be summarily fired because clearly it no understanding of how politics works I think the president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do\nThe Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do real basic cost is going on what people would have felt like when there were sixty three [noise] it's a punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTalk rules his party by fear they're going to see him a lot less if they get their butts kicked he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser\nOr not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome high earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it really is depressed me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of ban\nYou keep your post you could move to please get real dangerous to their hand you\nKeep your daughter 'cause\nI was nine years old when I first got the top George I know you base the scene on talks you yourself got growing up what is it like to film a scene that fictional but that represent something completely real to move to the black community\nUm you know it was a very emotional scene I remember um Russell Hornsby replays math Carter would choke up because he has kids himself I have a Fifteen year old son so it was a very emotional time because in the African American community that is something that ... have been through a one way or another\nFor me it was with my uncles and my dad you know they came out of their military rights you know in sixty eight with family members in Detroit Milwaukee, Wisconsin so all those things were planted inside me\nSo in the movie you know vote is too young kids who actually hearing the same for the first time it was just the most ... is deals with history is deal with survival and how we can continue to stay on this earth without police brutality or being shot or being killed you know this part of the the fear of the African American community\nOne of the most fascinating storylines for me is how star feels like she has to be two different people all the time and she thinks part of that means literally some doing her blackness while she's walking around her mostly white high school Williamson ...\nSlang makes them cool thing makes me put those kids\nFace can basically Williams's star doesn't give any one of the reasons that color and get it and I hate myself for doing it\nAngie I read that part of the inspiration for stars double life came from your own life because you also lived in a mostly black neighborhood while attending a mostly white private Christian college in Mississippi what was that like feeling like you had to be two different people all the time\nIt was a struggle um I did I Lived in a mostly black poor neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi and I went to a mostly white upper class private school just\nMinutes away from my home but in ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... um I Would make myself more presentable I thought I'm I was careful of how I spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called out the races and like what well one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas\nAnd he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath\nAnd we could all pick a gift and it was like get gifts like will because ... and all of this other stuff you just trying to get rid of and when it was my turn I pick the gifts\nAnd there was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water gun and one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and because some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to um\nAnd that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up\nHonestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that I was worth speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinated with this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white [noise] it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes through a cop smile when I pull ...\nOut of hiding something costs though\nBut you still don't know if they did anything wrong\nThat's why we searched\nBut if they open the door or reached through an open window\nThey're probably going forward [noise]\nSo I think I see a guy I don't hesitate ...\nIt was so interesting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just white against black racism it's much more complicated right you're ... you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught and sometimes that system could be taught with African Americans as well so you have that version and and then also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys on their side ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old ... do you think audiences\nAre more capable of empathy when they're watching a kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving this kind of trauma unfortunately yeah yeah\nYeah when I first decided to ride it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and all these new I wanted to write young adult fiction\nUm but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl for several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because they'll often victims in these cases are teenagers they're young people\nOn Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve and I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that when adults pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl them a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence\nWho has so little experience you literally witness this girl that come a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults there's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nRider Angie Thomas and director of Georgetown
