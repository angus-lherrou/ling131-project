{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Kavanaugh didn't work very hard at it all it is a lot of people felt like the masks flipped when he testified last week in front of the Senate Judiciary committee that that the true part of the nature of his character came through loud and clear\nBut I'm the expectation shortages that he will be able to suppress set when he if he does indeed sit as a justice on the Supreme Court to in the hands down rulings\nWell I suppose that that is the large open question there there's there's no doubt that the um experience that he's just gone through has been incredibly difficult incredibly rancor is and has raised a whole level of bitterness an anger in his mind\nThat a lot of people question whether or not he's going to be able to dealing grapple with over the coming years and even if he does manage to come to a measure piece about what he believes has been done to him over the course of the next few over the course of the last few weeks the question is will\nA large portion of the American public half of the American public believed that he really has\nBeen able to set that all of a side right now\nHalf of the American public is profoundly deeply troubled about aspects of his temperament his character and had tremendous suspicions about his past behavior and his partisanship how are either the either half of the country going to be able to get past it\nBut in truth ... the Supreme Court by nature of the kind of rulings that had hands down um make political decisions does it not\nIt makes legal decisions they make a decision that are formed by\nDecades if not hundreds of years worth of jurisprudence and precedent it carefully cabin carefully looks at all of the language doesn't a careful looks at all of its decision it doesn't make you know kind of grand sweeping political gesture and it doesn't you know just all of a sudden decide\nThat does some political imperatives must be done today or tomorrow\nThe Supreme Court is a is a careful judicial institution\nOr ...\nPercent he founded with the Brennan Center for justice\nBut they don't care to bus to school called Laura and that's it\nFrom the suspicion of news off for me to Lynn Marshall and the rest of the team in London\nAnd you hear more from the BBC tonight at ten o'clock each you can join us for the real story from the BBC\nThis evening are expert panel will debate Norway's energy future and ask what lessons the country has for the rest of the world it's Norway from loyal to renewables on the real story from the BBC tonight is Dan you're on K U T Ninety point five all things considered coming up next\nSupport comes from ... passed in line with trained inspectors to develop Britain control plans to eliminate mice and rats from classes ranches castles Hacienda tree houses in ... ... dot com\nSupport comes from quality foundation repair respectful detailed consultations and an educational process keeping clients informed at every step Moran quality foundation repair Austin dot com building the future restoring the past\nThis is Austin's NPR station K.

nominee using partisan language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition purely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact\nCause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nHe said that he'd like Kavanaugh as a judge even put his picture and one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh's demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the good of the court who is not the ill to get a new justice you know really do put a part time job\nNow I don't really think the cabinet as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones [noise]\nIt appears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens who another so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grip their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect\nChief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once and all of this cannot be sitting well with him yeah\nRepublican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall is that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work\n... less than the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be enough for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record\nCollins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes where the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that ... than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the center of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been divisive and bruising and many fear it has been damaging to revered institutions the U.S Senate and the Supreme Court Ron\nElving is senior editor and correspondent on Washington desk here at NPR News and he is in our studios to talk about this higher on good to be with you Ari\nIs and it's always been known for a special kind of ... geology where members can work together respectfully despite political differences and reach compromises for the sake of the greater good that's been deteriorating for a while now do you think the Kavanaugh's confirmation process his down even further damage\nIt's the latest symptom of an infection that's been present for some while we've had parties in the Senate almost from the very beginning but there have usually been at least a few conservatives in the liberal party liberals in the conservative party lots of moderates in between\nThe politics of the last quarter century however have been purging those crossovers and those moderates even those who now remains sound increasingly like hardcore partisans\nAnd here's Sen Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina thought of at times in the past as something of a matter of brick somebody who could talk to both parties\nHere is that the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a week ago addressing the Democrats across the room boy all our God I'll never get it of course Lindsey Graham is referring here to the mid term elections next month when Democrats had hoped to have at least an outside chance of getting back in the majority Lindsey Graham\nNew cameras were rolling then does language like that actually poisoned the kinds of relationships and interactions that you see behind closed doors or some of us just for formative\nWe should say there have always been occasions of heated rhetoric and angry words [noise] uh and especially from certain members at certain times but as you say the collegial nature of the chamber and the lungs six year terms that they have and the need for certain ... arrangements and super majorities that they have to get\nThat tended to bring people together\nBring them into a more cooperative mode of operation but that can break down and that is what democratic leader Chuck Schumer was referring to this morning on the Senate floor when he concludes his argument for rejecting Kevin\nFor the sake of the center of the Supreme Court ended up America I Hope I pray my colleagues will do so\nWe've been talking about the impact this fight is having on the Senate what about the Supreme Court where if confirmed Kavanaugh might serve for decades do you think this will have a long term impact\nThere it will be a burden on the members of the court who have proven remarkably good at times at least at ... their political differences within their larger relationship to each other\nAnd to the court and to the country and to the law now that gets harder after a confirmation process such as this process that is stressed by the collision of major movements within the culture\nWithin the Supreme Court for years we've heard stories about justice is with ideological differences having close friendships having a relationship that flourishes even though they might be on opposite sides of a political divide do you think this affects that kind of dynamic\nIt could and that is what concerns people the relationship between for example Antonin Scalia the anchor of the conservative wing and Ruth Bader Ginsburg a very different justice and yet quite close friends who would spend every New Year's eve together and go to operas together and so on\nThat kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can't deal with it but it will make the court more visible\nDoesn't mean they have to come out from underneath those rubs doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN with that they're going to stop their very small group conferences but it does mean that for many people the court has been identified as something different from what it was before\nNPR's Ron Elving

tsunami more than fourteen hundred people died as NPR's Julie McCarthy reports a lack of heavy equipment has slowed the recovery of bodies from the mud and debris\nMuch always someone pulling the roof out or is it falling down around us [noise] anyone number ... ocho John too high roller sit inside the ruins of a full seaside us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... regardless of what the actual facts on the ground or\nYeah and and I we we forget how susceptible we are\nTo being influenced in our thinking by things that we don't think are influencing our I think I mean there's are saying we we trust our perceptual systems to tell us what's going on in the world\nAnd yet because as artist saying often were social species and so we interact with other people whose opinions influenced our own opinions\nThe same thing actually holds true not just for things that we would call opinions but the things that we would call back mhm yeah and that's really where this is crucial so the example that Bob was giving is is an important one because\nThere's there's a fact of the matter here I mean you you could find lots of ways to independently verify which line is longer and your your visual system actually generally speaking does a pretty good job of figuring out which line is longer\nAnd yet despite what you're seeing you will actually begin to state and and potentially even believe that that your visual system is is giving you the wrong information just because of the social\nConsensus that formed on the other side that's actually a fairly common aspect of human psychology because we have to determine what to believe from the people around us but the concept of gas lighting is is essentially a deliberate use\nOf a strategy that takes into account the fact that uh the social environment has a big influence on what people believe\nThat a point that are making this really important to emphasize this is how verbal rehearsal changes belief I mean not just what you say out loud changes the way other people think what you believe but saying things yourself river Herschel bleaching just what you come to believe is true\nAnd when you're in an environment where are the people around you the public media all kinds of sources of information are professing a certain a view of the world\nAnd now that's in your memory and we every time you call it a mind that's another reversal calling that to mind that actually becomes more and more true but often you know ... ... when we're trying to um make our own decisions about something whatever happens to be\nWe we we tend to decide who among all the sources of information either people or organizations were media streams or whatever who who should I be trusting and the most\nThat if there are things that differ and things that are that are in in in disagreement who I'm going to put more credibility ... the only one who said too about you know we're talking about this can actually be a good thing\nIs it almost all aspects of human functioning\nCan be co opted for some ill intense but\nActually the same mechanisms are being used in those things about organizations who are trying to save something repeatedly so it actually becomes the fact of the matter is our earlier now\n... not only can can these mechanisms be co opted for nefarious purposes society but but the same mechanisms can also play a role in just one on one interactions in which\nYou you may actually change the way that you interpret\nSomething that happened in your life on the basis of things that another significant person in your life says and if that individual has an ulterior motive\nTo get you to believe something that is more favorable for them and less favorable for you even in very significant circumstances\nThis can actually then cause you to question your entire view of of reality inside of of that interpersonal relations and this is particularly dangerous in situations in which something that's happened to someone a in a relationship is\nIs something that they might actually be a afraid of or shame to or not actually want to talk to lots of people about\nBecause in those situations are the conversations that you end up having are often had with a single individual yeah and and hey\nWhen when you when you may have something that's happened to you that that feels shameful\nThen you'd actually like to believe that it didn't happen right so there's some motivated reasoning to want to to go along with someone who said oh no no you have a ... you've completely misunderstood the situation\nBut on top of that you can't engage in any of the other behaviors you would normally engage in to try to check your interpretation of a situation\nSo often if you're confused about something you consult another authority or another individual\nSo you know if you can't decide which actor was in a particular movies you know which is there's no shame in that then you talk about it for a while and no matter how confident anybody is there you go to IMDB and you look it up yeah\nBut when a and and and similarly you know if if you're confused about about some something that something else going on in the world or even some event in your life\nYou can you you might just reach out to a bunch of friends and say well so you know here's here's what happened what do you think ... and and in those circumstances your friends will give you a different opinion or their own opinion which may or may not accord with what you heard from someone else and that gives you perspective\nBut if you're unwilling or unable um or or or ashamed\nTo talk about something with anyone else now the single individual you may be talking to has a profound influence over the set of beliefs that\nUp next week we'll talk about who their culture with ... and ... get David average Jake Cronin and Michael Crawford aren't engineering I made that connection right and I believe\nThere was a lot of anger from folks that you don't normally see anger from um particularly Lindsey Graham and ... you were sort of\nMore moderate level headed Republicans and um and there was a lot of past tense use of you know we were friends we used to work together um and I I think this anger doesn't go away after a while\nTo really what do you think is going to be able to move on from this or has a poison some of the relationship for lawmakers really need to get things done\nI mean look I think the partisanship that was happening that's present in the Senate ah existed long before this confirmation battle this certainly exacerbated it to a greater extent we saw the pressure that was placed on the moderates\nIn the Senate like Senator Collins like Senator mansion um I I Would disagree that ah it's Senator Graham is still considered one of the more level headed members of the Senate right now he seems to be really really ... a spokesperson basically for President Trump at this point and that's the role he served throughout this confirmation process but\nThe Senate is a tough place for moderates to be right now and I think that only a grows more so\nLooking beyond Congress this controversy has prompted some women to share stories of abuse from years or decades ago\nUm for example a newscaster Connie Chung told her story of sexual assault in the Washington Post this week\nOn two was sexually assaulted her and said he was like well what about Fifteen Years ago the mullah through in our family doctor\nWe're now one year after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke and launched the me too movement and so I Wonder what it is about this Kavanaugh for debate that is making people speak out now who might not have told their stories after Weinstein or Bill Cosby or any of the others Kimberly what are you saying\nWell look talking to women who have called me emails me to tell their stories of sexual assault which is happening with a lot of journalists uh lately I think the idea that someone who was accused of this could reach a level of such power despite women coming forward\nAnd telling their stories about that it's really alarming to them uh it's not about I mean a lot of these women were talking about how the anger of women these women were angry they were more gutted\nOr that this could happen that these stories of women even if folks say like center called and said that she believes that\nDr Ford suffered some thing but that there's no proof that it was well the idea usually when it's an acquaintance situation that a memory works that way I mean Dr Ford's the scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough\nTo stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about a Ford's accounts against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more Broadway\nSo I I I think that it's an important horses and to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an end Collins spoke to a great deal in her and her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any corroboration and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm In the case of ray Moore when he came up and accusers came forward\nTo the Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and express sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember\nHow many [noise]\nBe laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this was a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and and sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been\nA very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we ... we saw Brett Stevens and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone I'm right on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Susie ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was a fear Republicans told me they were afraid that the court part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play\nI I don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president or with the comments that you played\nA I think that really ... the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly it could I mean look Clarence\nThomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be at a function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much and this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I think that there's probably did maybe pushing more right were then he would have otherwise been had this been a smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of Rick a sham columnist

I think that one alone and all of our senators have great\nAnother woman Susan Barnes arrived in Washington from Rockford, Illinois with her daughter Leighton they're also here to protest and read me there are signs Eighteen year old lady who goes first\nIntegrity still matters no cabin I sat here for a beer with the guy's not good for the Supreme Court\nSusan Barnes says she doesn't want to see ... on the high court because of the impassioned testimony of Christine Blasey Ford she told lawmakers last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her decades ago while they were both in high school\nI definitely felt for eye doctor for it I Am doctor for it bond\nSays she was sexually assaulted in high school and never wants her daughter to go through something like that [noise]\nKevin supporters were hard to find outside the Capitol today but Michael ... who says he's an independent was happy to take up the mantle because\nNobody else is out here on his side right now they're all here they need to hear that they need to hear that\nAs the time New York for the Senate to vote protesters huddled around a portable speaker of the clerk\nWill take a moment in the Senate to record the official tally expected to be fifty one to forty nine\nAnd the bird count on nomination we'll get Vance\nFinal confirmation vote would happen to\nSome protesters vowed to come back tomorrow even though it looks likely Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nIf that happened many say they will take the long term casting a vote in next month's midterms\nReally\nRocky learning Washington [noise]\nBack in July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee among people gathered at the White House for the big announcement which John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome it's pleasure to be with you\nAnd my right in thinking you were pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now increasingly likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate trust some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAnd numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum interesting questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho we didn't last night and said she no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was ... but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo American cities or not he said she said questions that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure\nWe don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnew him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as a family that he would have acted like and what Comic Con and had\nBy the way he acted like and I ...\nI think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nShe was in her mid twenties when she had me and my grandfather got her a a house to raise me in but it was pretty clear early on that she wasn't able to give me the adequate care that of a baby would need\nSo my grandparents ah youngest to children their their names are linen Holly and they were in their early teens when I was born and and blend in Hollywood would babysit me when I was about two years old and\nThey'd come home and tears and they'd say mom dad we we've got to get that kid out of that house um and so my mother shortly after I was born started using again and and with with using came ... other criminal activity to support the habit\nAnd ask my my grandfather started lining up ah the legal paperwork\nTo gain custody of me because he didn't want me to to slip and to become a a ward of the state\nYou also write ... about what it's like to be raised my grandparents and at one point there is a scene as them taking out their headstones and you talked about the idea that you're even as a young child and that's kind of living with death\nThey were planners right so they were like wanting to make sure all their estates for an order should something tragic happens so and I was an eight year old kid and they were very talked openly about you know there will what would happen if they were to go soon\nA ... you know my grandmother anytime you took a photo with her\nShe would say if they have that comes out good put it in the paper which meant use that for her ... where I Want to make sure she makes sure you choose a very flattering photo\nJust put in the newspaper when she dies or and yes they picked up their headstone a and they we were just very casual lead you driving home from Cornell and hot dogs in Worcester and they said oh let's just stop by\nThe end of the sun is a must stop by the cemetery and and there it was there no my grandparents who are my parents their their first names and their birth years but no death states\nThat's a lot to handle\nA lot and you're laughing now but at the time like ... were you a quiet kid where he like how did you take this and\nWhat they were very funny people to see my grandfather would say\nYou know when they when they barely put me closer to the street so I could sneak out at night and then my grandmother like gift basket [laughter] that is an all you know we're on radio so you can see me but I my main taking a cigarette in and out because that's how they that's how these folks [laughter]\nMy grandmother reminded me often uh that I was very lucky enough to be addicted to heroin when I was born a she was so you know anytime there might be a news report you know in the in the early mid eighties about you know kids who are addicted to drugs when they were born she would just pull out of cigarettes like you know you you're lucky you were born like that right you know that right [laughter]\nRight yeah yeah whatever\n[laughter] so you begin to draw right but when you're very young and what kind of outlet does that come for you\nI becomes an escape it becomes the one world that I can control right so um it by the time at it it's therapeutic it gets my mind off things my mind as they are on the page a part of my research into this book because I saved every sketchbook\nI had throat my my teen years really and looking through them\nAll I can think of that kid was angry [laughter]\nYou know what I my grandparents never once considered you know putting me into therapy and part of that was their generation you know they they came of age and the great depression you just you just didn't talk about things\nUm and so I I you know I had friends that I could speak to I I certainly had some adults in my life I could speak to family members and and teachers at school who always very patiently offer to listening ear to me\nBut the sketchbooks to be able to work through some of this sort of darkness I had in my head um they gave me an outlet\nYou write in your dedication you write in his dish into your grandparents and mom you say that the book is called for every reader who recognizes this experience ICU there there is a rise in the number of uh grandparents raising their kids right because of\nThe opioid crisis and when you read these stories [laughter]\nDo you think oh God there's a lot of kids who who are going to go through what I'm going through or what I what I went through\nThere are a lot of kids going through that now and of course when I was a kid I thought it was the only one in America being raised by my grandparents you know\nAnd I didn't take any other my peers and my elementary school a great school had these sorts of problems and come to find out later I mean they certainly did so I Know I Hope that dedication to young readers who are experiencing a similar\nA tracking life might feel less alone by that to know that I'm acknowledging that this might be an experience that they are also having\nIn the book you do kind of reconcile with your birth father you find him and you develop a kind of relationship um with your birth mother do you feel like you ended up having a good relationship do you feel like you've kind of ... gave her for how you grow up\nWe had a great relationship for a number of years so uh she sees skipped my high school graduation which is weird this book ends I'm Sorry spoiler alert you graduated high school [laughter] uh and ... and um\nSo I went off to college without having had any contact with her uh but my my grandparents made sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and so over the years we did develop a great relationship um we danced at my wedding you know she got to meet\nMy first two kids um but it was it was it was when my second child was born that she started getting into trouble again and start getting arrested again and a loss you wouldn't say say as much it was it was pretty clear that she started using Ghana she certainly was\nA surrounding herself by some nefarious individuals\nBut I did a lot my last discussion that last time I saw her was about a year before she died and we we left it was she said to me I Love you and I always will\nAnd without missing a beat and I said I Love you and I always well um she she never really took ownership though of of any of the stuff that happens um she would often say when you're just going to get over it which is a tough thing to say to a kid or you sort of learn to move past\nThings but it's it's certainly nice when it's at least someone owns up to their poor behavior right which she she was never able to do\nWell ... thank you so much
