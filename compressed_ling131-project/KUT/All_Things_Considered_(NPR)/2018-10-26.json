World Service with me John donors some\nToday there are over two hundred and fifty eight million migrants around the world living outside the country of both\nGlobal migration is arguably one of the most hotly debated issues some would say problems of the twenty first century in July a\nHundred and Ninety two un countries in fact all of them apart from the United states and hungry signed up to a new global compact full safe boldly on regular migration it's headed by Louise Arbour the former Canadian Supreme Court judge an international prosecutor\nThe global contact is they at text that was negotiated between member states of the un\nIt's a non legally binding document essentially it recognizes that migration policies are an after a state sovereignty states can determine who comes on their territory\nUnder what terms and conditions subject to something\nYou may now Schmidt of an issue isn't it because it's not binding and it's basically saying each country can do what they want\nExactly but it also recognizes that the best way frankly to have your national policies enforced is to the cooperation of your neighbors\nBecause without that you can have any policy you want if it ... or ignored by your region or by the rest of the world you're not going to get very far so it it really is an effort to better manage human mobility\nNow the elephant in the room is the United states under President Donald Trump one of only two countries not signed up to this I think the other one is hungry I mean how disappointing and damaging was that\nIt was it's always disappointing I think any in the spirit of multi lateral is him to have everybody at the table this was a set of negotiations so number of states negotiated that the United states pulled out back to the right on the eve of the beginning of the negotiation\nSo in that sense I think it is a disappointment particularly a country that has so much experience with migration and on the other hand the tax is what it is it it has a lot of aspects I think that would be of interest to the Americans if not today further down the road so\nI really very much hope that at some point we'll have a form of re engagement by the U.S\nLast year I think you talked about some of the language around migration as being deliberately in videos on poisoning public debate I mean who you're talking\nAbout the well I think there's just as there are lots of expressions that uh people except sometimes without realizing that he carries an undertone of prejudice for instance\nYou often hear the expression in legal migrants well you know when people don't pay their income tax we don't call them in legal taxpayers but the connotation is that your criminal in some ways the reality is that most people anywhere in the world who are in a country\nIrregular need that he's in the knock property documented session most of them I've actually come in through legal channels like with the visa but then have overstayed\nTheir terms of their student visa or their tourist visa so this it's an example of where terminology tends to insulate that prejudicial negative aspect of migration\nAnd my grandmother language is stronger than that isn't it I'm just looking President Trump has talked about an ... of immigrants coming up from\nSouth America at the moment are traveling through Mexico\nYeah and you hear expressions I chords in swarms in waves on all of which has the effect of exaggerating the trap or the danger that a migration poses\nDon't you feel your swimming against the tide some ... you don't hear the representatives of too many governments expressing the concerns you all around the world\nThe reality of migration is a much better story than what a lot of perception carries people tend in every country they tend to overestimate the number of migrants in the country they grossly overestimate the negative aspects how much crime is committed by migrants\nUh what is the unemployment rate the perception tends to be overly negative they're reality\nIs not perfect I mean I don't want to suggest that for a minute but the contributions that migrants may get to the economy the fact that most\nWestern countries now have deficits in their workforce that if well managed to be filled by migrants on a cyclical basis it doesn't all have to be towards citizenship\nThe amounts of migration has increased dramatically over the last century can you imagine a time when there were maybe ...\nWhile the world is currently organized political each by state\nI just read a ... second in the future whack it imagined that being noble as well actually well just adjusted\nYeah actually it's quite interesting if you look at environments in which they are no borders take a country like the United states or Canada you know the U.S a huge country with three hundred million people who could go anywhere they won in the country\nIt'd be interesting there to say well why are not all the people of Iowa moving to California\nWell it's essential to people stay home\nUnless the unless it's unless they can't make a living any more people move in search for work or they'll move it there's a natural disaster so we have to worry about what's coming the increase in a migration worldwide has moved from two point seven percent of the world's population in the year two thousand\nTwo three point four today I think we should expect more in the future if not the in relative terms\nThe world's population is growing so there'll be even if we stay up three point four percent that's more people like need to move and the effects of climate change for instance could cause elements of force involuntary displacement that could even increased these numbers\nAnd at the same time then you might expect that will be a rise in anti immigrant sentiment\nYou could but at the same time I think there will be a realization I think in many developed countries in the entire western world ... that if we're going to maintain our standards of living and if we're going to have someone to pay for pensions for instance well\nWe're gonna have to have these people come from somewhere because the demographic projections\nAre of a very serious decline in virtually every western country I think having a realistic positive attitude and working to maximize the benefits of migration and meet its challenges that's I think what's really serious the on the table for world leaders\nPresident Trump has talked in recent weeks about shutting the southern border bringing in the army to do that I mean what do you think of that\nNobody has ever questioned the rights of countries in fact their responsibility to control their borders I mean that's the only question\nThey really issue is how again is the best managed for a country to control its borders and I think you know opening legal pathways for people to come and work in the formal economy as opposed to\nHaving national policies that in fact encourage illegal entry and then working in the informal black market economy in my view is and nobody's interest\nAnd that was the un special representative for international migration Louise Arbour who join me in the studio earlier she was bringing this edition of news on to a close for me\nAnd the rest of the team enjoyed the weekend [noise]\n\n\nMy gym have mining saxophone tenor sax are singing along with him

there he's fifty six year old fifty six years old lives just outside of Miami north of Miami and Broward County\nIn the FBI said they identify them by a fingerprint and that's important because if the if I can I Do you that quickly from a latent print you're probably in the system and you've probably been arrested a lot and in fact he has been a he has a record going back a couple of decades for shoplifting various kinds of staffed\nUm he was even charge at one point with altering his driver's license too so that he would look younger because he was single I'm\nIn two thousand two he was charged with threatening to throw an explosive device\nNow do these previous crime syndicate a pattern of political graduates or political violence I mean you mentioned that bomb threat that it made\nNot really as far as we can tell I mean he has been very active online very pro Trump he's a registered Republican but there's no indication before this that we know of that he's been involved in the kind of political violence or intimidation\nUh his lawyer on some of those older criminal cases for about a decade and a half ago is named Ron lowly hum and he recalls that two thousand to bomb threat situation is a case of his client losing his temper with the power company\nHe says that uh he was talking on the phone with them about a problem and at some point you said if the maybe you'll give me better service if I throw a bomb at you they called the police and ultimately lowly his attorney says prosecutors are concluded that there was no evidence that there was anything here more

script shepherds killing has come to be seen as a classic crime of hate and anti gay bigotry his internment today was an occasion of solace hope and resistance Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten\nNational cathedral has hosted stage funerals for three us presidents but al ... people have not always felt welcome\nSome sugar drove the response which is fascinating for a couple of reasons right the first of course is just if what you're trying to do is to get people to eat in a more healthy way and you think well we've got to cut down on fat because that's going to be associated with cholesterol and all sorts of other things\nAnd then what you do instead is to replace it with sugar which is something that's driving people to want to take in more calories\nThan inadvertently you're putting people in a in a psychological situation in which they're going to want to ingest more calories than they can turn off\nAnd doing it in a way in this particular study that illustrates the fact that regardless of what we're consciously thinking about what we're consuming foods\nOr brains are responding in ways that we're not even imagining happening right I mean I I don't I don't think most of us would imagine that it other than the actual conscious responses we have to food if this is delicious or I Want more of that or I don't or whatever that in fact\nDifferent neuro transmitters are being released in response to different foods in ways that we are not entirely will not an all aware\nOf sand and what's fascinating is you know when the brain is responding\nWhat it's really trying to do the brain isn't really trying to give you a pleasurable response with the brain is trying to do is to figure out what it is it's supposed to learn in this situation exactly and so when your brain releases all of this doping mean a lot of what it's doing is telling it remember this and do this again when the situation comes up\nAnd so when you get that huge response from that milk shake what it really does is to put you in a situation where\nYou start craving milkshakes when you see a milk shake you really want to drink it\nPart of what's happening is in this drive to make the food healthier they replaced the fat sugar you put people in the situation in which the brain then learns eat more of that sugary stuff right\nAnd and that's why it backfires and then people don't know why they think I'm but I'm eating fat free food writer\nAnd of course all of this has an evolutionary history because of the scarcity\nOf good sources of sugar\nAnd for for a long period of time and and now of course the sugar is found in abundance I mean we can get sugar very easily in contemporary society at least in industrialized world and so now\nIt's understandable that those vestiges of our evolutionary past which taught us to go get more sugar because it's rare that you're going to encounter such an opportunity Cornell functioning to our detriment\nRight and this is just an example of why it is that it can be very difficult to control our behavior in a modern environment that is so radically different from the environment in which the brain developed in the first place and food is one of the places where you really see that because\nA food because of of modern agricultural practices food has become fairly cheap and fairly plentiful so that it it when we don't have the kinds of scarcity\nIn this culture you know it's not that there are places in the world where this happens horse but but in this culture we don't have that kind of scarcity and our brains then lead us to do things that seemed like a good idea like a hundred and fifty thousand years ago\nAnd uh aren't such a good idea anymore right let's talk a little bit about um\nSweeteners artificial sweeteners do they have any effect on the brain and the way that our brains well received sugars\nThat's one way to create a trick writing because what our\nBrains are doing is responding to our taste receptors to what it is that we're eating so if you create a taste that simulates a taste of a natural thing like sugar and you create aspartame or whatever other kinds of things people do that create that sense of sweetness I suppose the brain will respond\nIf it's just flying through the taste receptors that of course it's not going to have the same effect perhaps on other systems in the body because the other systems recognize that this is in fact not sugar that actually does\nThis actually causes a problem because part of what happens is again remember that what the brain is trying to to do is to predict the future and then react to the future so it's not just the case that this artificial sweetener gives me this sensation of a delicious sweet taste\nIt actually is an alert to the body that there's about to be a significant violation of homeostasis or there's a big word what does this mean your body wants to stay within sort of a particular set of parameters\nAnd if I throw a bunch of sugar at it I actually run the risk of doing harm to my body that's why a diabetic it has to monitor a their blood sugar because because having too much sugar and the blood can actually be a problem\nSo if I get an alert from the from my brain telling me I'm about to get a big influx of sugar\nThen the brain sends a message down to my pancreas and get busy and producing insulin and so you actually\nDrop your blood sugar in preparation for all the sugar that's about to come in through the stomach so you've got this red alert going are are you know\nAnd and and now you know the Packers were ... uh uh releases the insulin that\nYour blood sugar level drops and then and then your body said they're going what what\nAm I [laughter]\nRight so now your body is confused because it's got to drive your blood sugar backups and now it says you better eat something [laughter] because I've I've got a ... a drop in blood sugar so it's it's actually not such a good idea to trick your brain\nNext week

Raman ten days right I mean right but the the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and\nThis is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics healthcare a and to the issues and a lot of voters are voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead\nA that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think can integrate many house races to David to Democrats are putting\nA lot of stock in conversation about health care how are you thinking\nAbout that yeah you could sum credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy of big change with American identity or he plays on cultural and eventually the issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats are not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for pre existing conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly cultural critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a diesel response in normal times but in the times like this of the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity of big argument against what Trump's stance EJ last hard minute to you\nOr I think that the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about\nA lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending uh being open for example a to refugees and away the Trump Administration is not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was\nA this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a JD honor the Washington Post and Brookings Institution thank you so much good to be with you David Brooks of the New York times has a good weekend thank you will ...\nYou always know it's friday afternoon when you hear a look back at the week in politics on all things considered and if you agree with what I just said there you should definitely be a member of ... because you know it's always friday afternoon when you look back of the week in politics\nAnd maybe you're not a member\nSomeone else in Austin right now is helping to pay for the week in politics and\nThe coverage of the arrested a of a Florida Man who's facing up to forty eight years in prison for sending these suspicious packages and all the coverage last week of the boil water notice and\nThe elections in early voting in transportation in central Texas and affordability in central Texas all that stuff is covered for you because someone else in Austin and the Austin area\nIs helping to pay for it and on this last day of our membership Dr we're asking you to take that extra step from being the listener to being a member of this radio station joining us now come on board the K U T ship\nLike ... dot org and clicking on the donate bug\nBig thank you to Carl furry who said it's simple K.
