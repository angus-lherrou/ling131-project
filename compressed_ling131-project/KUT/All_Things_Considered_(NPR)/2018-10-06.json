apparently\nIn the last couple of days there have been some progress it's hard to see what the progress will be because\nThe most difficult issue in the negotiations between Europe and the u._k. is of course the Irish border what's going to happen with Northern Ireland and Irish Republic off the Brexit that is completely unclear um it seems to me really unlikely that there is now some kind of\nAgreement up on what can happen on that border since it is so complicated\nGoing back to your first on said do you feel that there was a view in Brussels that Theresa May needs\nSupport a given the divisions within a governing conservative\nParty yes I think indeed that in Europe people were very surprised by\nThe complicated situation British politics is in that right now Brussels prefers to negotiate with the reason may because I\nThink their argument is that it's better to do with the devil you know than the devil you don't know imagine just that the tour he would have a new data and a couple of weeks from now that that would even be voting elections in the United kingdom will very uncertain factors that will make\nA deal formal harder to agree upon so I think Brussels we'd like to show the reason I made that she can get a deal with the European Union and it's also a way of saying that even British politics some stability is required to get to a deal\nBut the um ... show was expressing the view that I'm no deal wasn't the kind of outcome that the European Union were looking for is that the neighborhood is that plausible\nYes I think it will be very hard to find anyone in Brussels who played for a no deal it is in the interests of the European Union also in Britain's interests to have\nA comprehensive deal before the end of this year because the relations between you and you you will be there forever and it's not that the u._k. simply disappears from the European continent that's not how it goes of course trade\nIs very intense and will stay very intense there are many corporations between you and you and he's really nobody interest to have a no deal because it would be very bad for the two partners and of course\nNo deal means also a lot of uncertainty\nJanis

worried about not getting her pay out and making less will try to do the math but first this news\nAnd shows up and is evident on election day that is NPR's Scott Detrow Scott thank you so much I think you\nWe are going to spend a bit of time to speak in trying to understand the fallout from this intense and emotional battle around Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination confirmation\nLater we're going to hear from one of Christine Blasey Ford's attorney said about what this episode has meant to her professor Ford of course being a woman who testified that judge Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago but we're also going to try to examine some of the divisions that this whole process has laid bare including in the legal community\nAnd a remarkable development retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said publicly that cabinet is not fit for the high court earlier this week more than twenty four hundred law professors or to send it in a letter not to confirm judge Kavanaugh needless to say other support and defend him UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh is one of them\nHe refused to sign a letter he mentioned that he clerked with judge Kavanaugh previously and socialize occasionally with him and he is with us now by a sky professor Volokh thank you so much for joining us\nVery much wrecked leisure thanks for having\nPersonal I just wanted to ask how you reacted when you saw the letter I understand that a law professor were circulating this letter I just wondered what your reaction was\nWell I sort of imagine\nHow would I have acted if I were publicly accused on national international television\nOf extraordinarily serious crimes and if I was innocent and the letter was was based on the assumption that to a judge Kevin O's reaction was about whether or not he was in I Can't imagine that I Would like to keep my cool\nUh I don't think most people would maybe if you could uh but I think a lot of people would be extraordinarily angry\nThat would feel kind of publicly humiliated and a ... even somebody with a reputation for ... a judge Kavanaugh has developed a in his uh many years now in the DC circuit and could easily slip I think that's just human nature\nOne of the reasons that we cause us that you wrote a blog post that caught our attention and you mentioned that you clerked uh at the same time as judge Kavanaugh and that you socialize occasionally with him do you think that you're the fact that you know him play some role in how you respond to this\nYou know I expect it probably doesn't measure uh we're not terribly close we just I don't think we've seen each other for for for quite a while and we didn't see each other that often or even back then socially but am I influenced by that sure I'm a human being like usually when it being like all of us are\nAnd and as you know other human beings are many of the women are reacting very differently to this they are bringing forward experiences that they have had where they have been assaulted I'm physically in some cases threatened with assault and their reactions to it\nAre also very important then one of the reasons we ... that we're interested in as I said earlier kind of the fallout from this and the kinds of decisions that have been laid bare in this do you think that people's personal reactions are guiding that response to this or do you think it's something else even among your colleagues\nI'm quite sure that personal reactions are guiding lots of people on this just because that is human nature I Can't speak any particular person of but uh uh it it's not surprising that this would be so I don't I don't think it should be condemned but again if you're asking\nSomebody to maintain complete composure [noise] um [noise] I think\nYou're expecting something that is too much to expect of a normal people casually again you could have someone who does keep his cool under such extraordinary circumstances but I think that's the exception rather than the rule and I think if\nYou're asking about judicial temperament\nA much better guide for judicial temperament is how a judge Kavanaugh behaved in about ten years more than ten years on the DC circuit bench should everybody seems to say that his temper but it's but excellent\nThere okay except for you know the defendants are\nAccused of terrible things all the time that they may or may not have done\nAnd they are not allowed to behave this way I mean a criminal defendant who presented himself in court or herself who was accused of something terrible that he or she did not do would not be allowed to scream at people would not be allowed to be patronize singing condescending toward the judge or toward other parties\nWell if I were a member of a jury and somebody was on the stand accused of effects could be anything else I and I saw him are reacting in anger when questioned by the prosecutor and interrupting say the prosecutor I I'd like to think I wouldn't hold that against him\nOf course I'd look at the evidence I'd want to know if he's guilty uh but uh uh I Would\nSay if he behaves angrily that anger is not inconsistent with innocence and it's not a fine of bad character is a sign of someone who is reacting to very very serious accusation\n... let me go back to the question of the legal community um do you agree that this is a an episode on on what else to call it I don't mean to minimize it by calling it that\nA moment that has risen your a profession one of the things she noted in your blog post is that a lot of people disagree with you people you respect they disagree you disagree with other people whom you respect and that you've had a lively dialogue about it\nHas this been a notable moment for your profession and why do you think that is\nWell\nA yes or notable this is something that's very high profile about a very important matter\nA people sharply disagree on this of course the legal academy is overwhelmingly liberal\nAnd uh and as you pointed out a\nWar one is coming from it colors ones perception and are just as conservatives predisposed or spotted one way to such things liberals and other way so it's an surprising that there would be a lot of uh she's coming from kind of a hard one political reaction\nBut also or just even people who are not particularly partisan I feel very strongly about it because it's in the news or a and because it is about somebody who can bird but even if I can for under will be a very important to a bigger in legal life for decades to come\nThat is Eugene Volokh he is the Gary tea

reporting in China and he's here with us now in our studios in Washington DC to tell us more about the administration's case and why the speech was so remarkable rang thanks so much for being here payments over here but what is the significance of vice president Pence's speech and why now it's so striking the tone if you went back\nYou look back over Thirty years forty years of diplomacy Americans were actually quite careful not to be directly confrontational this is very very confrontational Barry aggressive almost has a feel to me\nOf a Reagan evil empire speech what it's signaling is he sees China is the greatest threat to the United states and in terms of the wind now later in the speech he talked about the vice President Pence talked about trying to try to influence the mid term elections that we provide any solid evidence and that could be a pretext of blaming a bad results for Republicans on China\nBut there was a much bigger picture here that we should be talking about\nWell I Hope that taught from it but I wanted to ask you have you seen a shift in how the Trump Administration has been dealing with China what\nI see with the Trump Administration is it coincides with the sea change in attitude\nAmong scholars in the United states American businesses in the old days you went back to the nineties do thousands\nAmerican business extremely supportive of the Communist Party they're making a lot of money there they now feel that the playing field is not level at all they do feel sometimes held up to give up intellectual property so there's been a big shift here an attitude towards China and I really think actually Beijing is just catching up to it\nSo you're saying that the sea change is not just this administration's attitude that goes beyond that in fact there was a clip from vice president Pence a speech where he spoke to that let's play the Chinese Communist party is rewarding or\nFor worse thing American businesses movie studios universities think tanks scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nIs that true can I just don't make sample\nAbsolutely a and somebody to sell censorship I'll give you an example with in movies\nThere are a lot of movies that you might have made in the nineties early to thousands it might have been critical of China\nYou couldn't get the financing for them now because the Chinese audience has grown so much for movie it's so important to the bottom line of a global film a great example would be a remake of a movie called red dawn in which the Chinese are soldiers were to invade America\nIn post production they had to change the Chinese soldiers in North Korean soldiers 'cause there's no way the Chinese ever would have ever let that movie into China what about academics scholars absolutely there's ... and journalists to it is it's much harder now are getting visas can be more difficult they use them as a way to punish scholars you write about subjects\nThat they don't like about like ... ... far western area in China as well as Tibet in Taiwan\nAnd so there are certainly a feeling that some scholars do self censor in order to get visas others are very brave and and are willing to not be able to get visas to go in\nSo one more question frankly to us as you know it's very focused on Russian influence in elections and a Russian efforts to interfere with us all elections when it comes to undermining confidence in democracy particularly let's say in the United states which country is the bigger concern Russia or China\nWell I think Russia is been very overt about it I think China what's concerning about China is that it's much more of a challenge it also would like do undermine the message of the United states which is freedom and democracy\nThe difference being that Russia does not have a business plan it's a relatively small compared to China in terms of economy China's an enormous economy getting very close to surpassing ours in the future and they're also a much more sophisticated and well run country and so I think it's a much much greater challenge\nBut these days because of what happened in a few thousand than sixteen election this is what we focus on which is Russia\nThat NPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt visiting with us here in Washington DC Frank thank you so much happy to do it [noise]\nYou're
