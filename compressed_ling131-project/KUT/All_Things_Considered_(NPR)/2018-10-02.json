Trump\nGrand has become an outspoken supporter of the president's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a display of anger before the Senate Judiciary committee Graham lashed out at Democrats who he believes brought forward sexual assault allegations at the eleventh hour\nGod I hate to say I post these had been my friends let me tell you when it comes to this you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend Graham has\nBeen a believer in the idea that judges should be assessed based on their qualifications rather than their philosophy so he sounded betrayed as the stress that he had voted for two of Obama's Supreme Court picks\nWhen you see so to mind Kagan tell them at Lindsay's at all costs I voted for the I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most on at the bull sham since I've been in politics\nIt was an angry moment that showed stark contrast between the light hearted political moderate he once was and the pro Trump booster who he has become Tim Mak NPR News Washington\n\nAstronomers announced today that they found a new planet in our solar system one where they catchy nickname but the plan maybe most memorable for another discovery it portends NPR's Joe Palca has more\nThere are several things that do make the new object nicknamed the goblet remarkable Scott Sheppard says size is not one of them\nOn a small and dwarf planet we don't know exactly how big it is but we think it's about three hundred kilometers inside which was about six or seven times smaller than what to do is\nShepherd is an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution for science he and his colleagues first spotted the object in twenty Fifteen\nThere's only one thing we know immediately when we find it object and we know its distance from the sun but that's all we can say we can actually say anything about sport at\nThree more years of measurements have revealed the new objects orbit and it's a doozy first the goblins orbit isn't even close to round like er it's it's a very elongated ellipse next it takes forty thousand years to make a single revolution around the sun\nAnd it never gets closer to the sun than six billion miles about twice as far as Pluto is from the sun\nObjects this far out with really elongated orbits are just weird\nThe current models of solar system formation don't predict these objects\nJuliet Becker is an astronomer at the University of Michigan now it's possible that these models are wrong but Becker says a better explanation may be the giant planet some astronomers think is out there\nIn easier solution is the existence of planet nine because it naturally creates these objects in the solar system\nThe gravity of big planet like Jupiter are Neptune Ken sling smaller objects into weird orbits if they happen to wander by but the goblin doesn't get anywhere near Jupiter Neptune so some astronomers think planet nine might be out there doing the swinging\nBecker says right now only a handful of objects points to the existence of planet nine so there's plenty of skepticism that it really exists\nI guess I have kind of take her in my mind is how many new objects do we need right now we obviously don't have enough\nBut this particular object is such a unique orbit and it's so useful that like I the kicker in my mind just jumped up like where a lot closer to having enough objects\nCertainly the goblin gives new confidence to several teams already searching for planet nine but so far no luck\nJoe Palca NPR News [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things
