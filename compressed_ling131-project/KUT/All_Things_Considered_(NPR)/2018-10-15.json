{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "News out from the b._b._c. world seven is with me John don't assume there's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump few would dispute that so he's ... he's a breath of fresh air\nFreight to tell you like it is and rip up conventional wisdom of the home and abroad\nAnd his opponents he's a dangerous wrecking bowl after these debts on the international stage attacking traditional allies an undermining Sobel cooperation but just about oil would agree that when it comes to many of the body is responsible for policing international law he's ...\nUnited States will provide no support and recognition to the international criminal court as far as America is concerned the icy she has no jurisdiction no legitimacy and no authority we\nWill also canceled billions of global warming payments to the United nations money that we don't even know what they do with it we will no longer surrender this country or it's people to the false song of global as\nThe United states and the only response of of course we withdrew from the human rights council and we will not return on Jill real reform is an acting\nPresident Trump speaking at the un last month but almost two years into his presidency how much of that rhetoric aimed at reforming or publishing global institutions has been turned into concrete policy\nThat's a question I've been discussing with full ... above my administrator and official Harold Koh used the sterling professor of international law at Yale Law school and has a new book out called the Trump Administration and international law\nWho is actually adopted a policy of anti globalism and this was tempted to withdraw from or destroy most of the institutions that have been created in the post war period he's tempted to disengage from the Paris climate agreement the Iran nuclear deal\nHe's broken trade rules and in the recent book by Bob Woodward\nThey indicated that on his desk were his papers to withdraw from three trade treaties the world Trade Organization or\nA NAFTA North American free trade agreement on the Korean us free trade agreement only because but then national economic councilor took these things off his desk or did he decided to not disengage from them\nBut you argue and I think you use a boxing analogy referring to the famous rumbling the jungle between Mohammed Ali and George Foreman that he's not winning\n[noise] oh that's correct those will recall that fight no the foreman was heavily favored\nIn fact so heavily favored many people fear that we would be killed in the fight\nIn round southern the penultimate round if you were to ask you observers who's winning or most of them would have said form and buy a mile but in fact the next round Ali came off the ropes and knocked him out and I think that that's a moment very close to where we are now\nA Trump has expanded massive amounts of energy and political capital on a whole stream of initiatives but in fact they've had very little effect\n... has said he's going to go out the Paris climate accord as you say he has ... Saturday Night\nHe hasn't done it um my point is that the laws much bigger than Donald Trump was asked can you stay the thesis of your book and three words and I said yes\nHe's not winning in the flurry of activity as we were George Foreman it looked like a lot of happening but when you actually measure the long term impact he hasn't prevail so all they've done to make an announcement or so this leads to an interesting phenomenon\nThe United states across the board has resigned but not left from many of these organizations were still in the Iran deal\nUntil the end of twenty team but in these arrangements which they're not as it's helped to create we now have little or no informed because who wants to listen to a lame duck\nWhat if he gets to Tim's\nWell I mean that's the question a lot of what he has been able to do is because you had majorities in both houses but uh if you're asking what does it look like when I'll eat comes off the ropes you could see the following scenario the Trump loses one or both houses of Congress\nAnd then suddenly it might be that the traditional Republicans decide that Trump is not their candidate for twenty twenty for the first time in a very long time we have a coalition government between Trump bites and traditional Republicans and they have a few areas of overlap of interests\nBut if that group decides that Trump is not the candidate who's going to get them back into the White House in twenty twenty or they have others available um for example Nikki Haley UN ambassador just resigned\nHow significant did you think ... resignation was in terms of international isn't within the Trump Administration\nAh you know in the land on the line when it does is queen she was better than the others but her basic philosophy ... little sense there are rumors that she was the person who wrote the famous anonymous out bad and the this was the first word for it leave I don't know if that's true\nOr maybe she just decided which I think it's fair that she had gotten this much mileage out of business she was going to get you know being associated with Donald Trump isn't good for your long term reputation\nDoes it matter if he's trying to undermine international law all given that international lawyers all very well on paper but he's rarely enforced\nOr the forest every single day I just got back from the u._k. my bags were protected by the Warsaw Convention our land and\nUm I went through passport line which was affected by the ocean agreement are went over to an ATM machine and withdrew pounds from us to nominate account pursuant to\nSwift than other kinds of a banking protocols are protected by international law it's invisible but it's extraordinarily important in facilitating the way in which we do everything\nWhat do you think about the Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh he's quite well known in legal sickles for rejecting the idea of the international ... could be a restraint on executive power\nRoads drew lose one justice um you'd was my student ... he will take some time to find those are certainly not a rough confirmation\nDo you think he got a real deal you knew him pretty well presumably\nA I think that um you're supposed to do three things tell the truth uh act like the Supreme Court justice and show that he's knowledgeable and trustworthy I don't do than any of those things\nYour book is also a cool to watch and I suppose isn't that what kind\nOf well the Reverend Martin Luther king used to say the moral our group universes long but it bends toward justice\nOr it doesn't burn by itself in each of the areas that are discussed a immigration ... separation policy of families climate change Iran nuclear deal\nThere has been concerted across the board network action by individuals resisting Trump's disruptive activities and that is what has a load to so many different stale moods and frankly a tally in Richard has not made much progress\nAnd that was Harold Koh the sterling professor of international law at Yale Law school and all of a new book called the Trump Administration and international law and that's all this edition of news for me and the rest of the team bus enough [noise]\nOn the fifth grade teacher from North Carolina so this was the first day of school and this is my first day teaching in Texas and I called to grow up to say the pledge of allegiance and she did and I was ready to go on and she went right into the taxes pledge of allegiance\nAsk why\nAnd what it was over I was speechless I'd never heard anything like that back in North Carolina\nAnd I thought to myself that called my parents called my friends called my former colleagues and say guess what there's a taxes pledge of allegiance and the kids say it every day that I was well obviously there's a Texas pledge of allegiance\nTo based on everything I knew about Texas [noise]\nMy name is Alex merit and you're listening to K.

Judiciary Committee and frequent Trump credit in fact on the Senate for the day after that rally ... took issue with the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee\nI spoke with Ben Sasse earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought through how to process all of the due process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of sexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual aspect\nAnd the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nYou know they've kind of move from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who were coming after men in your life with false allegations [noise]\nWell I mean it's clearly the case that we need to figure out how in an American tradition that's always had writes for the accused as well how we navigate things that are regularly going to be tried in the media\nSo I I think that it is a false choice to divide the world and to whether or not we want to love and protect our sons and whether or not we want to protect and trust our daughters\nUm this is a cultural movement and moment that as much bigger than politics the me too movement doesn't belong to Republicans or Democrats the me too movement belongs to women\nWho are having the courage to come forward and say this is wrong people should be protected we want that for all of our daughters and all of our sisters um\nWe also want there to be writes for the accused and right now we haven't yet navigated to a place that will hopefully be a lot healthier than where we are now\nIn the meantime we've heard Mitch McConnell another is called me do after this an angry mob is that what you see is that what you saw in the hallway and that is that how you feel about that activism [noise]\nDidn't hear a leader McConnell comments about the me too movement as a mob I heard leader McConnell speaking to the fact that there are a politicians in American Life today who are saying to people if you'd differ on a ...\nLet's see if you you should be hounded out of a restaurant that's actually happening right now where your politicians going to cameras saying don't let people eat dinner with their kids that's wrong\nI'm Dr Ford's family and Brett Kavanaugh's family both suffered repeated death threats over the course of the one month circus that the Senate conducted I'm a politician who has to for a time of serve in public life and I get death threats and it is what it is because\nYou put yourself out there in the public square but if you're going to serve under traditionally or if you're going to raise allegations about sexual violence in the past the fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who might differ with on policy to be handed out of restaurants that is an odd like behavior\nWhat is your response to the activists who says if you are paid by me the taxpayer and I see when public it's perfectly fine for me to tell you what I think and it's perfectly fine for you to be held accountable for policies that are harmful\n... this is why I wrote them most fundamentally because political tribalism is ramping in our time there are all sorts of important debates that need to be had inside politics but the idea that politics should swallowed the whole public square\nThe idea that there is no civil society that there are no cultural debates that there are no economic debates there are no religious

Sears\nIt wasn't the store with tears when we had plenty\nLisa's father John Daniel Reese works for ... for Twenty years in Tyler, Texas he joined after World War two when department stores in smaller towns were still mainly downtown on main street\nBack in the day and I think are all we had one and that was here that were electronic TVs and clothing fabric and soon the department store\nIn those days Sears was the reigning king of retail chain that grew out of the watch and jewelry catalogue company started in the nineteenth century\nIt was the shopping disrupt earlier today it brought commerce to the door steps of families living on farms and in remote communities paving the way for the mail order boom of the twentieth century and in a way the online shopping we know today he uses even credited with the idea of the department store parking lot\nAnd the tradition at that point was street parking\nVicki Howard wrote a book on the rise of the American department store called from main street to mall\nBecause it's such a long lived there for the hell out a lot of different changes\nOver the centuries Sears tried a lot of things it launched Kenmore Appliances craftsman tools all state insurance it bought stock broker dean Witter and real estate firm called will bankrupt it introduced the discover card but the most famous Sears creation was always the catalog\nAt the end of

eighties she says her family didn't shop much so gifts from Sears were very exciting\nI felt like we had just shop on Madison Avenue [laughter] and I felt like a million back\nAround that time in the

Doo one two years ago by Eighteen normally it would be safe GOP but\nOr or there would be unintended consequences to their policy but actually evil\nAnd that's that's not a recipe for going forward in the American system assumes that politics do a limited number of things\nBut the really interesting things happen in your family and your neighborhood in your workplace in your local worshipping community and right now so many of those local tribes of textured meaning er and collapse and people are looking for substitute tribes and politics and I don't think that's going to work out very well\nYou talk about the idea of red and blue jerseys you also talk about um cable news being a problem social media being a problem um why is it cable news or something to pick out in particular\n[noise] well we don't have enough shared facts right and so the business model of a lot of different media consumption right now is about trying to deepen and intensify the anger against that you can find in your one percent news tribe\nThat maybe it's worth back it up and just looking about what the dissenter mediation of media has done in the Nineteen fifties when there were only three channels uh Seventy percent of American households every week tuned into I Love Lucy that wasn't important content but it was shared content\nSo when you think about the MSNBC and the Fox news a sort of tribes in the world they're each getting about one percent of the American public\nBut it's a deep and intense one percent that doesn't think there's really any need to reach across the divide and have any sense of ... that's a really unhelpful set of economic incentives that cause us to silo ourselves off from our neighbors\nAnd you go on those shows you don't have to\nA fair point you got to talk to Nebraska is however you can get to um I live in Nebraska but that's on weekends and so in DC Monday to friday I fly off to my day job and Nebraska's a small place but it's still one point nine million people across Ninety three counties and a couple of times zones\nA four hundred and fifty miles east to west so you want to talk to your people and listen to your people however you can get to them but right now it would be a lot more useful if we had a sense of we which bridged across some of those one percent of our lives\nSo I'm not picking on you for going on cable I think\nHe got to do what you got to do but it seems like lawmakers have a hand in this right if there are red and blue jerseys you guys are handing them out and the elephant in the room so to speak would be maybe the president Donald Trump bright people talk a lot about his language and his rhetoric how was that not divisive are contributing to the problem [noise]\nSure so I've been critical of the president or on a number of these points but I think it's also important for us to recognize that what we're struggling with right now didn't start two years ago this isn't about Donald Trump Donald Trump or no other politician can fix it either this is not a two year old problem this is a two plus decades problem in the making\nBut can I come back to this point because I think you know lawmakers contribute to divisiveness the way you talk to each other the way you talk about each other the way you talk about us as voters way you talk about activists I'm we hear people being described as evil as mobs right [noise]\nYeah I I think I mean you're surely right there's a lot of blame to go around and the kind of people we have serving in politics right now have become a tribe of people who think politics of the center of life and I think ... to ... you know if I could give a message to American voters\nOr don't elect people who think politics or the most important venue and American Life politics or get a really important\nUm but it's a place to do specific things to maintain a framework for to liberty so that communities of love and persuasion and volunteerism can actually thrive and flour\nThe things that make Americans happy or do you have a nuclear family do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful calling you have shared work you have shared vocations do you have local worshipping communities all of those things are connected to place\nAnd places being undermined by the digital revolution right now given this great stuff in the digital revolution but it is undermining our habits of being anchored in a place and we got more and more politicians who go off to Washington DC and they never really plan to leave Washington DC or the cable news stratosphere they never really plan to go back home\nThose kinds of people are rooted in grounded and they're not going to make very good leaders for a republic\nSo you don't sound all that excited\nTo be a politician and yet people talk about you are in terms of uh maybe running for president one day left to talk about that [laughter] you don't sound that excited to be\nThere I I think politics has a very useful role to play but it's about a framework for order liberty it's about the frame right the picture for him but the middle of the friend is American families thriving and working with their neighbor and disagreeing over the dinner table Sundays\nAlliances because you know you you were you treated someone who was saying oh I regularly consider leaving the Democratic party you basically said oh yeah I feel the same only about being a Republican\n[noise] yeah I don't think either of these parties has a long term view right now I think both of these parties are mostly trying to do anti tribe not what are you for what are the Democrats' big unhealthy long term visions of what other Republicans big unhealthy ten and twenty year long visions\nBut both parties spend most of their time trying to explain why the other party is even worse than they are and uh I think the two party system was not what the founders intended and I don't think is what we're gonna have forever but right now we're locked into a two party world we're both of these\nI'm sort of do up all of us are pretty content to just run against each other and tried to hold down any discussion about new and constructive policy ideas going forward but I think voters want better than that\nDo you want to be one of the choices are we going to see on the ballot\nA I'm a first time politician I think I'm One of eight people in the U.S Senate who's never been a politician before and we have three little kids and the deal we added our household was if the voters in Nebraska give us a six year

Fifteen or really the most significant single purchase right now because they're using that daily in Yemen and the bombing campaign that's now been going on for more than three years\nBut the Saudis don't have a lot of big contract at the moment as as we just heard and it's really the United states that that has the leverage because the in this relationship right now because of the way it supports in supplies the Saudi air force here's ... again\nTonight President Trump told the king he was cutting off spare parts to Saudi air force Saudi air force would be grounded tomorrow morning\nAnd the president said that if the U.S doesn't sell weapons to the Saudis in Russia or China would step in and do it but it's it's really not that simple of red tailed noted that you can't simply strap a Chinese bomb on an American F. Fifteen ... systems have to talk to one another\nSo the Saudis really would be in a tough spot if the United states were to use that leverage and cut them off and\nLook ahead with me or I have the Saudis made any kind of commitments in terms of what arms deals that are looking for in the future\nThe big one that sort of been under some sort of discussion is a missile defense system but again they spent an awful lot of money on the war in Yemen and they're not necessarily seen as being in the market for a big new contract right now the second point the U.S Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nHas to approve these contracts and the Democrats in some Republicans are quite upset with the way the Saudis are prosecuting the war in Yemen and for the past year so they've really been reluctant and it doesn't look like it would be an easy go for the Saudis to get a new contract\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you Greg thank you [noise]\nFrom

with reminding us who is James well how did he get on to law enforcement's radar and the first place\n[noise] gene fluffy is fifty seven years old and he worked as the security director for the Senate

of a secret foreign intelligence surveillance court warrant and I was in that interview lie to the FBI and December twenty Seventeen about his contacts with reporters\nI mentioned you're at the courthouse you were in court this afternoon for this hearing how did it play out did this we do come as a surprise\nYou know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with reporters taxed encrypted messaging apps and that made it a hard case to defend now Wolfe was charged this year with three felony counts of lying\nBut in this plea deal he'll only plead guilty to one which means he likely faces zero to six months in prison and the judge ... brown Jackson let him go home today\nAs long as he promises to return on December twenty for sentencing\nDude wolf himself speak in court today\nHe did the judge asked him point blank did you knowingly and willfully make a false statement to the FBI about your dealings with reporters and we'll send yes he broke down a few times got emotional and choked up\nEspecially when the judge told him there would be no trial in as a felon he couldn't vote or serve on a jury or own a firearm\nHis defense lawyer precedent Burton patted him on the back and handed them some tissues on occasion throughout this hearing and the defense lawyers also pointing out ... was not charged with and did not admit to sharing any classified information the defense team also says they're going to emphasize his long public service when he sense later this year\nPut this into context for us because the Trump Administration has made a point of saying it wants to crack down on leaks and on leakers does this case represent that in fact happening on are they doing more beyond this case\nYou know this effort is a little ironic because this administration the Trump Administration is among the leaky us in the last thirty or forty years they have\nTheir Justice Department has charged people in the FBI and other intelligence agencies sharing secrets with reporters and there are lots of ongoing investigations we don't hear about much the FBI of courses\nQuietly working many of these cases and even when they don't charge a compromise or a week of classified information like they did not in this James wolf case for people who are interrogated or investigated by the FBI\nThere's always a risk that they could charge you with lying to investigators instead that's exactly what happened to James we'll hear and could be happening down the line with other subjects and targets of government investigations into leaking\nThank you carry my pleasure as NPR's Carrie Johnson reporting on the case of James wolf the former

who has been extraordinary\nBen Sasse Republican senator from Nebraska doesn't except that\nIt's divisive and it was a mistake\n... as a member of the Judiciary Committee and frequent Trump credit in fact on the Senate floor the day after that rally sat took issue with the president's behavior while explaining his own concerns about the debate over the nominee\nI spoke with Ben Sasse earlier today about political divisiveness it's the subject of his new book them we started with what happened with the Kavanaugh hearings and his take on the me too movement\nThe me too movement is a very important movement it's messy and it's complicated and there are places where it's going to overreach and we haven't fought through how to process all of the\nDue process issues but fundamentally I think we have a culture of sexual assault in this country for decades we don't have a shared sexual aspect and the me too movement is very very important and we need to handle it with a lot more delicacy than something you can handle well at a campaign rally so that was an unfortunate move\nBut what's your response to many conservative and Republican women out there who have talked about this idea of him to movement that they're worried about their sons that\nYou know they've kind of moved from one part of the conversation to apart that says men are at a disadvantage here that there are radical feminist women who were coming after men in your life with false allegations [noise]\nWell I mean it's clearly the case that we need to figure out how and an American tradition that's always had writes for the accused as well are we navigate things that are regularly going to be tried in the media\nSo I I think that it is a false choice to divide the world than to whether or not we want to love and protect our sons and whether or not we want to protect and trust our daughters\nUm this is a cultural movement and moment that it's much bigger than politics the me too movement doesn't belong to Republicans or the Democrats the me too movement belongs to women\nWho are having the courage to come forward and say this is wrong people should be protected we want that for all of our daughters and all of our sisters um we also want there to be writes for the accused and right now we haven't yet navigated to a place that will hopefully be a lot healthier than where we are now\nIn the meantime we've heard Mitch McConnell mothers call me do activists an angry mob is that what you see is that what you saw in the hallway and that is that how you feel about that activism [noise]\nI didn't hear a leader McConnell comments about the me too movement as a mob I heard leader McConnell speaking to the fact that there are a politicians in American Life today who are saying to people if you'd differ on a policy issue you should be hounded out of a restaurant\nThat's actually happening right now where your politicians going to cameras saying don't let people eat dinner with their kids that's wrong\nI'm Dr Ford's family and Brett Kavanaugh's family both suffered repeated death threats over the course of the one month circus that the Senate conducted I'm a politician who has to for a time of serving public life and I get death threats and it is what it is because\nYou put yourself out there in the public square but if you're going to serve on the judiciary or if you're going to raise allegations about sexual violence in the past the fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who you might differ with on policy to be handed out of restaurants that is all black behavior\nWhat is your response to the activists who says if you are paid by me the taxpayer and I see when public it's perfectly fine for me to tell you what I think and it's perfectly fine for you to be held accountable for policies that are harmful\n... this is why I wrote them most fundamentally because political tribalism is ramping in our time there are all sorts of important debates that need to be had inside politics\nBut the idea that politics should swallowed whole public square the idea that there is no civil society that there are no cultural debates that there are no economic debates there are no religious institutions are there are no recreational places where our kids play wrecked sports and youth league that will not sustain a republic\nThat's Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse we'll hear more about his book elsewhere in the program\nTo Nicaragua now where
