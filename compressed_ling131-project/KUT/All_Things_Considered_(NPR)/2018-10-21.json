{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "This is James went into with news that it is a staggering statistic most year forty nine thousand Americans died from opioid overdoses according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control that's about the same number that were murdered and died in road accidents combined\nSome of the best make the headlines for example prince in the act of Philip Seymour Hoffman the most ... unreported another project statistic\nOccasionally though the statistics take on a human face last week and a bit trip period and the ... local paper for six year old woman my little ... who died after loan addiction to wipe your it's about a ... rural angry heartbreaking went viral it was written by his sister paid\nBy the funeral was today when I spoke to ... to head of the service enough to her she and her family were coping with ... ...\nIt's been a really difficult couple of weeks I'm definitely shocking and we're going through all the\nI think feeling all the grief said it's common for people when they've lost a loved one in which as not either ... has gotten all this attention and we realized that far too many people feel the grief that we're feeling right now\nYou mentioned the reaction to the the tree where you've taken by surprise for how much attention it has received very but it's meant to look to has it\n[noise] it has it's meant a lot to my family it's been bitter sweet and that the outpouring of support and just love and compassion and the stories people have shared with us have been a real source of strength and it's also just a reminder of how many people just a nice effect\nAnd these are diseases that for you it is a disease and who do you think is to blame for these death and it's a difficult question pumps you know blaming anybody but if you were to him and who a wolf who's to blame\nI mean I Believe that ... death was absolutely unnecessary and I believe that our system in the U.S is to blame for the fifty thousand opioid overdoses in twenty Seventeen and for all of the deaths related to opiate addiction that are not counted and that number\nThese institutions are failing people with a serious disease so I Do think that the system is failing and as to blame for her death\nBecause opioids on a prescription level of being used to frequently and that's how many people are becoming addicted\n[laughter] I mean that's part of it so it starts with the over prescription also starts with the fact that they're you know that he wasn't prescribed oxycontin and that's the first structure you try when she was sixteen years old she was given one recreationally at a party so those drugs have flooded the market they're everywhere\nIt's very difficult to get treatment when you want it the first time that he wanted to go to rehab we had to drive two hours across the state and by the time we got there they had given away her bed and there wasn't another one available for a week [noise]\nMedication assisted treatment which is when people take drugs like Suboxone zone or methadone which are highly effective they are not available they're very difficult to get\nAny doctor in the United states can prescribe\nA highly addictive opiate painkiller but to be able to prescribe one of the medications that addicts could use to stay clean doctors need to get a special training they have to get a waiver and they can only have one hundred patients on that truck\n[noise] we might be first try ... to I mean did did you become addicted immediately very quickly off to them\nThat don't know that it was a media than my family didn't know that it was happening at the time that he told us later the story of how she got to the place where she was an IV drug user but I think she tried it she loved the way it made her feel and so she continued to use it and then started to get out and then was physically dependent on it\nShe continued to use a George for many years what was it like during that period\nYou know there were a lot of pretty extreme lows there were also high you know ... tried again and again and again to get clean and I think that's another way in which the system failed her she would often go to Twenty one day or twenty eight day rehabilitation programs\nBut every time she was so full of hope and silver we completely believed that Maddie would get clean and she would make a good life for herself after she had her son we completely\nBelieved in her ability to parent him but this disease is quite strong my sister as\nWas very resilient very strong and the city's a stronger\nAnd tell us about what you have a son does that give her a new impetus to try and give up\nYeah she really transformed her life when she had her son and again she was clean for I think six months after she had him and then she relapsed at that\nShe got clean again and was clean for another eleven months and then she relapsed again but she tried so hard I mean she wanted more than anything in the world to raise her son and she was a wonderful mother when she was clean but you know we'll alone will not\nHelp someone to recover from this disease you know it requires more than just well\nI Know society in some cool to is often blames people's weakness or doesn't recognize just how powerful about addiction\nCompete and dismisses people saying well if you really want to go to give it up you could for those little words ... you\nKnow and it's funny and the U.S you know if somebody had the disease that's related to a behavior for example if somebody smokes and get lung cancer if somebody overeat and gets diabetes we don't deny them treatment we don't blame them and say no you can't add this medication we're going to make it really really hard for you to get it's absurd\nThese are highly addictive drug does he not a choice nobody wakes up and says you know what I Want to be a heroin addict when I grow up\n[noise] it'd be true you talk about how the disease ... to ... traces of incredible thought it was what was she like most talk much about some of our ... for use or sister\n[noise] I mean it was extremely difficult for my family and when he was in the dark places she would generally disappear you know we were never estranged from her\nYou know even when we didn't know where she was she would always just try to reach out by text or you know Facebook and just let us know she was okay but when she was in the dark places we often wouldn't see her for a couple of months and then you know she would resurface [laughter]\nBut I think terrible terrible things happened to her and she did terrible things in the name of her disease and and that's part of this I think it's very easy to look at that photo of Matty at her best with her son she beautiful Franco face white woman\nBut I think it would be harder for people to empathize with Matty when she was at her lowest and that's what I Want is for people to show compassion to people who are in the throes of their addiction whether or not they look like my sister\nHas a sort of an Dona on an up most of possible you could just tell me what your memories of Murphy oh\nYeah you know ... he was an incredibly fun person that just being in her presence being around her whether you are doing just the simplest thing like you know watching him earlier going for a walk with it's always a really great experience you had a wonderful if you are and\nYou know it was up for anything she would tease asked than you know they're just being in her presence of such a pleasure and I'm so sorry that I won't have that experience again\nLove your sister or new speaking to me a little earlier\nSo this was a ... a visa for me on the wrist ... thanks for being with us until the next\nShe would like to thank

who's been following the clergy abuse scandal there now the federal government is getting involved\nI think a lot of Catholics and non Catholics alike are just shell shocked and are wondering when do these headlines stop pouring out\nAds will meet my Sago rising STAR One man band and he's redefining genres\nOwn even if you go for this new\nThursday morning everybody woke up to hear the breaking news that there was a federal us Justice Department investigation into all eight diocese and the state of Pennsylvania so I think a lot of Catholics\nAnd non Catholics alike are just shell shocked and are wondering when do these headlines stop pouring out what do you think people are going through\nWell is there are a couple of perspectives that you know I've packed into a I started writing about this on and off in two thousand two as a reporter and what I noticed was initially a lot of anger toward us and how dare you\nBashed the church and that has faded significantly\nIn the last several years as I've done more reporting as as more grand jury work has come out as I've done my own investigative work on this\nIt is overwhelmingly a different story I hear from people who describe themselves as Catholics who are now disaffected who are angry who want to side with the victims who say enough is enough with the bishops\nYou know people are wondering my goodness every time one of these headlines comes out were devastated we're heartbroken were wounded were hurt\nAnd then six months we hope okay it's behind us and then it's back\nAnd now it's back again and now it's back again do you\nThink that this sense of anger and distrust do you think it goes beyond a practicing Catholic people who are connected to the Catholic Church I Wonder if it if it affects the community at large does it make them question what's going on in their world\nI think a lot of people it's very difficult for them to see what has now become document based excoriated ... of systemic practices within this institution\nAnd not wonder what the heck is going on there is a deep distrust I think in shock that this institution seems to have shown such a pattern internally a very very bad behavior and no sanctions\nIs there a sense that the federal investigation is a step in the right direction or is that optimism hard to come by right now\nWell it's hard to say right I mean anything can happen nobody knows which way a federal probe will go and whether it will yield anything but I remember talking to the victims even a couple of weeks back months back about the statute fight and\nHaving one say something on Thursday when the story broke about the federal pro which is\nI'm not holding my breath about a statute of limitations change in the state the one thing that will bring me peace if if and when federal authorities finally decide to explore whether the Catholic Church is an organized criminal network\nThat's Maria Pena writer she's a columnist with the Philadelphia Inquirer Maria thanks so much for talking with thank you so much for having me\n[noise] and now another story\nTroll watch theories [noise]\nFor this program we've been trying to keep track of the ways that Internet trolls especially those directed by foreign governments have been trying to influence American voters by pushing fake stories are hyping up stories with a partisan or mean spirited edge\nNow we've heard about an army veteran who's trying to eliminate this information on Facebook that targets service members and veterans he's flak about one hundred Facebook pages that have millions of followers and he's with us now\nChris Goldsmith is the assistant director for policy and government affairs at Vietnam veterans of America and he's also founder and president of high ground veterans advocacy and he's with us from NPR's bureau in New York crisscrossed with thanks so much for talking to us hey thanks for having me so let me let me\nAsk you to walk me through this now this started because you were trying to understand how well you are legitimate Facebook pages were doing and then you realize that somebody had what stolen your logo and it was pushing content with it and had more followers than you tell me about that correct yes so\nI was just helping my communications team manage our social media pages and um I typed in Vietnam veterans of America and one day I noticed that there was another page that came up before hours and it had an even larger following\nSo I investigated the page found out that they've been using our logo pretending to be us but they were sending everyone to a European website the vets dot edu but that was the first red flag where it's you know these people aren't just trying to sell T shirts or something\nThey're creating an entire environment to support the fake Facebook pages\nYou tell me about that what kinds of things where they using their page to say\nSo most of the stuff that this particular group of trolls was pushing a we eventually located them and in Bulgaria\nOne particular incident was there was a legitimate news story in rural Massachusetts there was\nA Vietnam veterans monument that had been defaced some kid took some berries and rubbed on it but what they did was they took that local news story in loops the fifty second video for four hours as Facebook Live video\nAnd over that they put a phrase that said do you think the criminals must suffer and encourage people to respond now it was based in truth but it was made to look more urgent and it looked like it was happening live this wasn't just you know one person in Bulgaria you know trying to build the following\nThis was a conspiracy what I'm basically doing is is leaving a trail of bread crumbs so that Facebook's threat intelligence team didn't take the actual experts to analyze the data that found\nSo that they can get more information about who's behind it\nWhat is it do you think is attracting people as it is it because they could combine it with this kind of deep patriotic sentimental what's the appeal\nSo the reason why they are going to the right is because that's the type of content that the extreme right is producing organically so blends in their goal is to blend in with\nAnd amplify the extremes in this country\nThat the ultimate goal here is is not veterans it is to make the United states in a permanent condition of paralysis they want for us to not be able to function as a democracy and the way that they do that is they sabotage any\nIdea of bipartisanship not just for our elected members of Congress but for the electorate and we use a society need to start educating ourselves\nOn the issue of cyber hygiene we need to understand that it's it's very important to everything that we share we need to make sure that the source is reliable\nAnd when it comes to politics we need to make sure that it's generated from inside the United states\nThat was Chris Goldsmith the assistant director for
