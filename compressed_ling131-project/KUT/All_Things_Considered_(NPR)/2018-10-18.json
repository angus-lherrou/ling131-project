S.\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely until their asylum cases resolved currently a court ruling says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks right this would extend vat\nAnd immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear the objective a binary choice policy that the administration is considering it punish and a church family is from seeking protection [noise] this is around ... the administration family separation policy\nJohn Burnett in round two or watered down whatever we want to call this revisiting family separation does seem challenges or if they're right I mean for example if they want to wrap up the tension of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days of the government doesn't have enough detention beds so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been the devil and the Trump Administration all along\n[noise] NPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Lewis\nInterior secretary Ryan Zinke has been one of the most controversial members of President Trump's cabinet there are numerous investigations into his conduct a secretary when they began there were reports that think he was planning to replace the independent watchdog leading some of those investigations\nThat department now says that's not happening and peers ... report\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling hug employees that Suzanne Israel tough HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector general Mary candle\nFor one thing inspectors general are appointed by the president and the White House hadn't announced anything\nAnd Liz Hempel it so the project on government oversight systems didn't have the experience that would qualify her to be an inspector general\nIndividual every the doctor they should be non political issue at over ... ... that had an investigative background that kind of crime and that kind of watched outlaw\nTops is a former Trump campaign aide who was brought to hug by Carson to replace the staffer who blew the whistle on Carson's plans to use taxpayer dollars to buy a thirty one thousand dollar dining set\n... ethics have also been questioned the inspector general's office has been looking at among other things his redrawing of the boundaries of the grand staircase Escalante national monument in Utah the benefit of Trump ally\nThere are other investigations says crusader director of the western values project a Montana based conservation watchdog group\nThere's another that involved a real estate deal that secretary thinking Family Foundation with potentially involved with it at home town that would've been finance in part by the German Halliburton which of course has a lot of it before the department of interior\nBut today in a statement to NPR Interior Department spokeswoman Heather swept said Carson's email had false information in it\nThat no decision was ever made to move tops to interior that while she was referred to the department by the White House as a potential candidate for a job in the inspector general's office quote at the end of the day she was not offered a job and interior Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\n...\n\n...\nIt's all things considered from NPR News you're listening to K.

G is a mystery but one that could be easily solved no need for a huge long investigation\nThe post to the reporters at the Washington Post have been out front on investigating this story in terms of trying to piece together what may have happened [noise] based on information available to you have to ask do you believe he is dead\n[noise] you know we we held onto this call him that he filed the day before he entered the consulate [noise] uh in the hopes that we could edited with him as we normally did\nAnd um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today [noise]\nHas kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world that we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him or that will ever be getting another call them from him from everything we know it seems as if he was victim of a monstrous\nCrime [noise] I'm going to ask you about the dual role that the Washington Post is playing\nHere there is of course a firewall between the newsroom and reporters and the editorial page but you run a a firewall that's always there but in this case has it been tricky with post reporters trying to aggressively investigate what happened even as your editorial pages calling on the Trump Administration to do more to investigate what happened\nNow I don't think so I mean you know in the editorial side were often they can ...\nI Know but is it different when it's a position on one of your own you\nKnow we are all in the post newsroom they've been inside and the new site I think everybody is feeling this very personally and I think we're all determined to show that you can't do this don't one of ours this can't be a world where our government\nCan lure a journalist to their own diplomatic compound in a foreign country and then the worst is true dismembered him and have him disappear\n[laughter] you just look they are about feeling this personally um how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful [noise] first of all he was well loved by many people [noise] you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world any of us want to limit\nOf the many things that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the post for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously Arabic speaking in reading audience and and I want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we see our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions across a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi Arabia\nWas he felt he could no longer to it at home and that a lot of people who wanted to express themselves in Saudi Arabia where muzzled or imprisoned and so he was willing to take some risks to do what they couldn't do and uh if we can do it in their own language as well as an English all the better he\nWrites in this last column about ah the regime in Saudi Arabia clamping down on on the Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either in English or Arabic in his home country and Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate our editorial orange balls pieces or other pieces\nArabic when you get a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this and that he was a patron he supported a lot of the reforms that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia says he's four\nBut he believed that the best way to accomplish them was to allow people to debate them and to express opinions and I'm In the long run\nThat's the way his country was going to succeed and I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFor an high it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post and a colleague of ... thank you thank you\nFor years there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens sit across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel a newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement and the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the buildings just across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nTrump's ability to help is limited though control of the house could be decided in suburban swing districts outside of major democratic strongholds but an NPR analysis finds Trump is largely avoiding those areas Jesse ... is a democratic strategist\nIf he were to come to a suburban swing district most vulnerable Republicans would likely be busy washing their hair\nTrump is concentrating his efforts in areas where in twenty sixteen he outperformed previous Republican candidates places like Erie, Pennsylvania where he campaigns last week areas Steffi and says\nThat are you know fashions of of Trump is that that candidly are are more Trump then Republican\nTrump is campaigning for a mix of House Senate and gubernatorial candidates who is Debbie and puts it are echoing the president's message on policy triumphs most boldly and proudly\nBoisterous rallies or a big part of the Trump experience but the people who would tend to these rallies aren't necessarily Republicans or regular mid term voters which is why I'm here Trump saying that while he isn't on the ballot his policies are\nBut to continue our incredible moment\nYou have to get your friends your family your neighbors your co workers and get out and vote early voting\nSteffi and says as many as thirty percent of those in attendance at these rallies either voted for their first time in twenty sixteen or typically only vote in presidential years\nSo these are these are real opportunities in front of big crowds for the president introduced his coalition members or better quaint whose coalition members those in attendance with their Republican nominee\nRepublican pollster Robert blizzard who worked on a congressional special election in Ohio where Trump held a rally on the eve of voting says he saw the president boost enthusiasm among based Republicans and in the places Trump is going to see much risk of it backfiring sense\nI mean democratic voters on a one to ten scale are already like uh Thirteen\nWhich is to say democratic enthusiasm is through the roof and complacency among Republicans is a bigger concern\nAt this point in time Republicans will get all the negatives that are associated with the president we sure as heck my you know by going to go after the positives as well\nThe Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson isn't so sure about that\nWhen she goes to a district she is a reminder that Republicans in Congress had become is yes and voters right\nBalance not of serving\nDoes the president help more than he hurts it's a debate waged every mid term Trump said this week though if Republicans lose the house he doesn't bear responsibility because he's been campaigning so hard for them ...

tourists tries out a new slogan\nNebraska now with indoor plumbing Nebraska little storm surge no\nNeither of those it's really there's Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone after the news\nAnd the headline says us needs Saudi Arabia\nThe government controlled media has stuck to this narrative that was offered by the crown prince in an interview he gave to Bloomberg News and bad is the journalist came to pick up his papers to get married and then he left\nYou see alternative explanations in social media that he's really in Qatar which is a country is seen as an enemy of the kingdom are maybe his fiance killed him um you see these conspiracy theories to explain the disappearance\nOf course how to use can search the Web for coverage say in the U.S media but the dissonance is striking this unprecedented golden coverage of the new Saudi Arabia\nHas been replaced by these dark stories of hit squads and brutal torture\nThat you know it's interesting listening to you and I'm thinking of the parallels to what ... himself wrote in his final call him the Washington Post just published and he was writing about how in the Arab world they are so subjective false narratives and these conspiracy\nTheories yeah he did talk about that it's really telling he described the effect of the state run narratives and he calls you know people victims of the majority of the population believe it but I\nThink there's something bigger going on here there's this is about the way Saudis especially young Saudis see the crown prince Mohammed bin some on will stay\nWith us for a second to the ... been talking about how the press is covering this is it possible to gauge how ordinary salad to use a are following this\nYou can see some reactions social media is where you see it shock disbelief fear you know when the crown prince he's known as NBS in the kingdom first came to power he built this cult of personality was young he was dynamic\nAnd young Saudis it and that's a huge part of the population\nThey saw him as one of them they base would say we love him he got them and he said he was transferred the country and in some ways he did his rained in the religious police he's permitted women to drive into work he's reopen movie theaters all of that is a really big deal\nThe new Saudi Arabia got all this great coverage it was suddenly cool to be a Saudi but now the country is getting this relentless narrative across the globe so you find Saudis they're angry about it they're afraid you hear you need our oil you need our money why are you attacking us\nThere is no hard evidence they say there's no official proof rule so does that\nTranslate into the Saudi public uh buying the official government narrative of what happened\nI think yes and no I've been covering Saudi Arabia for decades and people I've known for years are now afraid to talk to me um there's fear of getting caught as a dissident getting caught talking to a western journalists\nThere appears to be fear of the unknown when the crown prince came to power he created this tornado of ultra nationalism his face is everywhere in the kingdom so\nFor some they have rallied behind him some of them are changing their Twitter pictures to his oh wow is there any\nRoom for descent or for a free press or alternative narrative inside Saudi Arabia because there used to be before the crown

Woodrow Wilson ... active duty troops to the border during the Mexican revolution just stop raiders from coming across into border states but today we're talking about families with small children seeking asylum\nTheir longstanding federal laws that give protection to immigrants who qualify as refugees they have the right to cross at legal ports of entry and ask for asylum\nWhether troops could be sent to the international bridges to block them is an interesting question the policy come Titus act prevents the military from being used for civilian law enforcement\nIt's interesting that the the most relevant precedent to eh you're saying that you have to go back a hundred years took to withdraw Wilson right let me let me ask you to the Trump Administration frames all of this\nIn terms of crisis but the situation at the border is a crisis and so appropriate measures are required is the situation at the border right now a crisis well\nA homeland security spokesperson told me that

Administration is upset and frustrated they continue to blame everything on Congress for allowing what they called catch and release loopholes in the law\nThe d._a. just spokesman told me that the agency is examining all options secure the border\nAnd when that spokesperson talks about all options family separation is back on the table this policy that was so controversial that the president had to walk back and and reverse it when they tried that earlier this year and\nSo now homeland security is considering a new sort of watered down form of family separation but also to act as a deterrent to families speaking about crossing of such as those in the caravan uh right now here's the president on the south lawn of the weekend\nIf they fail the separation in many cases they don't have\nThat of course is the case that the administration made when they rolled out of the family separation policy right earlier this year or so what would a watered down version look\nLike well they're talking about something called a binary choice detained families with their children would have two options one that could give their kids up to a government use shelter where the kids would eventually be sponsored by a relative or a foster family who are already here in the U.S\nAn option to they could keep their kids with them in detention indefinitely\nUntil their asylum cases resolved currently of court rulings says the kids can't be locked up with their parents for more than three weeks rate of this would extend vat and immigrant advocates are appalled here's Michelle brane a of the women's refugee commission on a call with reporters yesterday\nLet's be clear it ... it's a binary choice policy that the administration is considering it punish and a chart families for taking this round of the administration family separation policy\nJohn Burnett ... round two or water down whatever we want to call this revisiting a family separation does seem challenges or if they're right I mean for example if they want to wrap up the tension of immigrant families the question of where they would put all these families\nRight and of course the binary choice is still being considered it's not policy yet but if they put it into practice the question is where would they detain all these families currently there are a little over three thousand spots for family members and what are called special family residential centers\nBut you're talking about thousands of these immigrant families that are arrested every week at the southwest border these days um the government doesn't have enough detention bed so for the foreseeable future you'll see the continuation of families\nBeing arrested their process for a few days and then most are released with ankle monitors with their kids to show up for immigration court and that's what's been dabbling the Trump Administration all along\nNPR's John Burnett reporting thank you John you bet Mary Louise\n\nInterior secretary
