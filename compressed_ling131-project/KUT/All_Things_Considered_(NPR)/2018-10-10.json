prepared to cut your consumption of meat or dairy products\nAre those are some of the steps recommended and this week's un reports on climate change it emphasized the need for unprecedented changes in how people live and a dramatic reduction in the use of coal to stop catastrophic changes to this planet\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on climate change report\nKept on insisting that the rising global temperatures recommended of under one point five degrees Celsius\nWas being was being exceeded and it's now completely off track heading instead towards a rise of three degrees Celsius is any of this realistic my colleague gratuitous shah spoke to Helen clock a former prime minister of New Zealand\nAs well in the head of the United nations development program but first also to deter helm professor of energy policy at new college Oxford\nDid he see the world embracing the changes recommended in Monday's reports\nIt's one of those moments of truth I mean if you look what's happening globally we are ... miles from the project ... that the I PCC recommend\nAnd we're a long way the kind of measures they have in mind so we have but in China nearly one thousand gigawatts of cold now that system that building two hundred and fifty new stations in China and\nThey're supporting two hundred coat bombs outside China as part of that development programs and they're growing at about six to seven sent around them which means China will be as an economy twice its current size\nWithin a spice about ten to twelve years [noise]\nSo we got India China and Africa all growing six seven percent or we go coal maintaining its role in the national stage and we've got the oil companies project in the old demand will go on up\n... of the reasons and the sense not to be chip food do you think it's realistic in the face of gross than change like that for these changes to embrace\n[noise] really we're going to need the most incredible political will and heavy lifting to get the policy setting some place to change one of the moment is not looking at one point five ... to to Greece future but something much much worse with with catastrophic implications\nIf public opinion possibly the thing that could come to the age of politicians and scientists to public opinion begin to change is not the thing that can make the critical difference\nOh certainly it could just public's demand action the problem is the public's onto it so consistent author when I was prime minister has a pair of\nPolling evidence that said do you think the government should do something about climate change to nearly everybody says yes yes they should and then when you say well you prepared to pay more for your picture all to do something about well nowhere near as many people like they should do that so it requires very bold leadership\nIn which case teach the hell do reports like this help to knowledge base government than public into thinking about what their response to that as he is\nI think it to the credit they like the CDC to post how\nThis kind of science based report about what has to be a little bit careful about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself I Want to do a great deal about climate change\nI've been guilty of propagating is telling the public that you know you can have the right to transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy to one that's based on renewables et cetera within the space of the few to ... do you know what it isn't going to cost you anything in fact it's gonna be economic growth in Homs\nNow I don't think any practical votes or believes that\nAnd all the evidence is is a housing clock correct to say\nThat when the public and confronted with paying for this and they've been told that he wasn't going to cost much\nThey tend to react negatively and ended up ... world how you get the population of China to persuade the Chinese leadership that ... the Republican support base in America the trends Mr Trump's mind but he's really quite take off\nAnd then talk if you accept that now this is good technology comes to the rescue ... trees for soda pile up the cost of renewables and so on coming down\nOh definitely and I think we should also heed the woods of next to where he said you either pay now to make the transition all you've got to pay a mainstream or light to that for the adaptation to the catastrophe that all the sessions\nWho are in town now isn't it much easier to defend that cost to another day\nWhat it is but that's not responsible law the what we really need this transformation national leaders who are prepared to tell the public that they can't get almost like a decent hell you all\nVery pessimistic I think it's sad to say do you see any reason to be optimistic about the way in which public perceptions govern perceptions of climate change may change\nIn one respect extreme you missed it the way the pessimism is about these ... down kind of global agreements the optimism comes from the transformation the technologies if you want to think for around the mid century or series so much and\nThe day will come when it's cheap to produce energy from known fossil fuels than it is from fossil fuels but we should focus on\nA really big deep technological transformation\n... gave up on the conferences and focused on the technology well definitely invest in the technology and the and the transition I think it is time to civil society to a step up in\nChina or in particular how to civil society make these steps and then America is it really going to make that difference\nYou see in China I think the regime will have to move for its own reasons if for no other and that is that people are getting robbed a ton of breathing heavily

growing by leaps and bounds every year planners never knew how many people to sex that they never gotten up poor and the one guy had an inspiration to take a cardboard refrigerator crate and\nCut a

Florida Panhandle today we'll hear from those caught in the storm has today is Wednesday October tenth and this is all things considered\n... and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this hour police have arrested a man for the brutal rape and murder of a Bulgarian journalists that questions remain about why she was targeted journalists in Bulgaria have green ...\nSo much throughout the years that I did this happen overnight also with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court abortion rights groups revamped their strategy\nWhere in need an ironclad networks have and providers across the country and we're forced\nHim to fill the legal and accessible and rising murders in Mexico have left mores running out of state NOW News\nAnd their reinsurance market which is the way insurance companies usually protect themselves from big losses actually dried up for a while so this new way of controlling for risk was developed and it was called the catastrophe bond essentially an insurance company sells a bond and the investor gets paid interest for it\nOkay to tell me how that works like what would happen if there is a catastrophe like a hurricane or some out of control wildfire or an earthquake\nWhile you're there is a serious natural disaster than the buyer of the bond has to foot the bill for some part of the damage so if you buy one of these bonds\nYou're sort of gambling that there won't be a bad hurricane season this year because you know there is you could take a loss for example right now about Fifteen billion dollars worth of catastrophe bonds have some exposure in Florida\nWhere hurricane Michael has had once investors are buying kept on well mostly big institutional investors hedge funds a mutual funds may be your own pension fund they like to include them because they're a good way to diversify risk and what I mean is\nIf the economy slows you typically see a lot of different assets like stocks and real estate and so on\nLosing value at the same time but the value of catastrophe bonds isn't tied to the economy it's tied to you know Mother Nature so when everything else is losing ground you can still make aha oh I see their way of hedging risk which investors\nLike I didn't really popular these these catastrophe bonds or bonds pretty popular there's about thirty billion dollars invested in them right now overall and the reason has to do with their ... they typically earn an investor\nAt least five percent and sometimes a lot more than that and that's because they're potentially so much riskier than other kinds of bonds\nSo anyone investing in them is going to want to be paid more\nThere are some pretty major storms in recent memory last summer there were three in a row we at Harvey which flooded Houston for days and we've had Irma and Maria then just last month Hurricane Florence land into the Carolinas I mean one after another have investors lost a ton of money on their cat bonds because of these storms\nYeah last year was was particularly challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bombed again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo as we're seeing more catastrophic storms are our cat was just going to become a riskier investment\nAnd that's always going to be a potential problem the more big storms you have sort of less attractive the sponsor them but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates and things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could are much higher interest rates on them\nWell now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were and that's that's bound to weaken demand for them\nInteresting lesson consequences of all these storms that NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York Thank you Jim You're welcome and we'll be following developments from hurricane Michael throughout the

S. and from Americans for the arts\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered and Mary Louise Kelly\nAnd I know that Chang President Trump is attacking Democrats over a plan to expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of blood or Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's claims and one of those ... is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the midterms now Democrats are talking a lot about health care to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now\nThey are also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities it also tabs in our pocket books in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters\nEspecially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think if there are and they're campaigning against GOP effort to repeal Obamacare fully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to to find the results in the November ... election\nIs health care and President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does time saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tech thirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade now that sounds like a lot of money and it is but what the president leaves out some important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing doctors and hospitals we put out of business that seniors would lose control of their health care\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their ... seniors\nOkay but realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain vetoed mental like Obamacare and GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and bright when you actually have to debate the the details of the plan\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa is probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true\nHe has made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think

that has created this phenomenon of rapidly intensify hurricanes\nWe're seeing a change I think in in sea surface temperature we're seeing\nStronger storms because the sea surface temperature of the ocean water is so much warmer we just don't quite have the knowledge available to us in the equations available to us to predict exactly when and how it's going to intensify and we need a lot more research to understand exactly when that will happen\nAnd so just described to me what was going through your mind last night as you're watching this and it's doing something different than you were expecting given a couple of days ago\nYou know in the back of your mind you're always thinking that this is something that could happen and it's something that storms can do especially when they have the perfect conditions the warm water of the Gulf of Mexico it's perfect for storms like Michael\nLast night it happened and we all were kind of you know looking at each other like yep there does and and\nWhen they say when it happened you're mean what you're watching wind speeds that are higher than you expected or\nYes as the storm starts to rapidly intensify it takes on this this buzz saw like shape it becomes very well defined you have the sinking feeling that things are about to get much worse than than the forecasts had suggested\nTo my central question of why predicting intensity so

got out of control\nHe was rushed to the emergency room closest to his son's house\nHour from Nashville and they just started putting in terms of lines are going to work and doing different things and kind of ... what was happening in at that point because you mentioned the shock when you go in there and they're like oh every Oregon is shutting down and have completely set his\n... is a leading cause of death in hospitals it's the bodies overwhelming reaction to an infection or bricks case was so bad the forty nine year old man ended up on a respirator and dialysis drugs sunk him into a state of quiet Elyria\nCatching especially lightly sedated and he was heavily sedated and that was not a good thing\nKaren says when the hospital told her to start calling next of kin it was time to get them transferred stat to hospital better equipped to treat him within twenty four hours of arriving at Vanderbilt Randy's condition had turned around completely he was off dialysis the ventilator in off the drugs that put him into a delirious have\nApparently I'm pretty much of a miracle\nHe said that you were on wind out of a recovery\nStill lies ahead\nStarted me get our faculties about man my brains starting to work really good again but just the fact that I can you know carry a conversation right now\nIs pretty amazing in itself and you've actually been up and walking right will allow

what he'd done to help bring about this dramatic change it wasn't just good medical attention it was a philosophy\nYou know when you get on an airplane you get safely to the next location because airline industry has a checklist\nWhen he started in the ICU he realized every doctor did things differently and he figured they can't all be doing the right thing so gradually she started building a checklist of the best way to handle basic task first they figured out when it's safe to take some off the ventilator he explains then\nWe started standardizing how to move people off of ... then we came up with a way to measure of your brain was deliberate should not what you got that measurement and we were doing this to you when you were there we were measuring whether you were delirious and you were at the beginning\nElite came up with a list of six steps to take in order to reduce delivery him in return patients to help as quickly as possible\nTo put all of this into a bundle which we now call the ... a B C D E F bundle\nThat bundle includes close management of drugs like sedatives which can cause to leery of\nPatients are tested daily to see if they can wake up and if they're ready to get off the ventilator F is for family engagement you let us as these all reduce the amount of time patients spend delirious and back in turn markedly reduces the risk of long term brain damage\nGetting out of bed early that eat part is cuts to him and a half so these things are all intersecting\nAs he sits on a ... bed usually explains that it's a big change from what many are you still do which is to knock out a patient and treat their dysfunctional body rather than focusing on them ...\nTo me the lynchpin of this whole thing is to respect the humanness of each patient thank you again a little bit [noise] they hear\nThe bundle when done correctly reduces the risk of ICU triggered to ... by twenty five to thirty percent easily says that makes a big difference to a lot of patients it's gradually been adopted it icy use in recent years but he says it's still not the standard everywhere\nAbout half from our last survey had been doing some elements of the bundle\nPulling it altogether a to F is a challenge Dr cook Volcker at the Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida discovered that when he took part in nationwide study to expand the use of the bundle in all sorts of hospital\nIt was not as easy as we expected it to be in a couple of aspects\nPatients require more time and attention if they're alert in bed or walking up and down the hallways with their respirators into we're talking about a a cultural\nChange so we have to have buy in from the nursing staff once we were able to get that by and then you have to have buy in from the physicians also\nThat's harder in a community hospital where physicians are more independent and the only two rounds three days a week gradually the ideas took hold he says so they're still resistant to using the a through F checklist to make sure every element is it tended to every day in every patient\nI think in concept it's the rule but actually going through and seeing a B C D E F is the exception\nIt was even a challenge to make it routine\nAt Vanderbilt problem land here wacky and Joanna starlings or clinical pharmacists to the ICU says when she arrived at Vanderbilt it was clear what needed to get done but nobody was responsible for seeing it through\nThe nice in any cat we need to be here and rethink bank in San ... helped me keeping a project to really empower the American dream than than every dad\nWest elites crusade now is to make what this hospital does standard around the world for one thing he argues it can actually save money by reducing the amount of time people spend an expensive ICU words\nBut the most important thing of course is not the money is the human being and so if they're getting better care surviving more often with a more intact brain and not bouncing back to the

the promoted ... visit our website K. you cheat on a large\nOf luck to you Mike\n[noise]\nAnd their reinsurance market which is the way insurance companies usually protect themselves from big losses actually dried up for a while so this new way of controlling for risk was developed than it was called the catastrophe bond essentially an insurance company sells a bond and the investor gets paid interest for it\nOK so tell me how that works like what would happen if there is a catastrophe like a hurricane or some out of control wildfire or an earthquake\nWell if there is a serious natural disaster than the buyer of the bond has to foot the bill for some part of the damage so if you buy one of these bonds\nYou're sort of gambling that there won't be a bad hurricane season this year because you know there's there is you could take a loss for example right now about Fifteen billion dollars worth of catastrophe bonds have some exposure in Florida where hurricane Michael has had\nWhat kinds of investors are buying bonds well mostly big institutional investors hedge funds a mutual funds may be your own pension fund they like to include them because they're a good way to diversify risk and what I mean is\nIf the economy slows you typically see a lot of different assets like stocks and real estate and so on\nLosing value at the same time but the value of catastrophe bonds isn't tied to the economy it's tied to\nYou know Mother Nature so when everything else is losing ground you can still make aha oh I see uh-huh their way of hedging risk which investors like I think really popular these these catastrophe bonds or bonds pretty popular there's about thirty billion dollars invested in them right now overall and the reason has to do with their ... they typically earn an investor\nAt least five percent and sometimes a lot more than that and that's because they're potentially so much riskier than other kinds of bonds\nSo anyone investing in them is going to want to be paid\nMore there are some pretty major storms just in recent memory last summer there were three in a row we at Harvey which flooded Houston for days and we've had Irma and Maria than just last month Hurricane Florence land into the Carolinas I mean one after another have investors lost a ton of money on their cat bonds because of these storms\nYeah last year was west particularly challenging for for the bonds and there was a lot of speculation that would kill off the market there was this fear you know investors would see these big losses and nobody would ever want to buy a catastrophe bombed again but the market has has come back pretty well\nSo as we're seeing more catastrophic storms are are ... just going to become a riskier investment [noise]\nYeah I mean that's always can be a potential problem the more big storms you have sort of less attractive the sponsor them but there is another issue I think that is even more of an immediate problem over the past decade interest rates and things like treasury bonds have been very low so investors have turned to these catastrophe bonds because\nYou know they could earn much higher interest rates on them well now interest rates in general are rising so relatively speaking catastrophe bonds aren't as attractive as an investment as they were in that\nThat's bound to weaken demand for them\nSo
