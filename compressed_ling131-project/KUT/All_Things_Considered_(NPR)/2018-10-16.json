disappearance unlikely death of journalist ... ...\n... talk to NPR earlier this year he told my colleague Jackie Northam that he was no fan of the direction crown prince Mohammed bin ... was taking Saudi Arabia\nHe has no interest in go to the full you think you can do it alone and who doesn't really any cult that opinion on the one to two those changes associated with him\nChilling words to hear now from that interview with our international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam and Jackie is with me now to talk more about the crown prince and whether he's a reformer or not he Jackie Hi Mary\nSo early on a lot of people thought that he was headed down the path toward reform and one of the big things that was cited was his decision to allow finally Saudi women to drive people thought about what the promising and there were other moves in a similar vein right\nYeah that's right it was just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia announced it would allow women to drive again that ban was seen as a clear sign of repression and the king them [noise]\nUm he also allowed women to go to work again any open movie theaters after about a thirty year ban on that too and all of this happened very quickly at the same time it's faces they were all over TV and magazines and that\nIs very dynamic compared to the rest of the older Saudi leaders who are known for making the decisions very slowly\nHe also is trying to open up the economy making Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil\nYes that's right yeah and and that's not going very well at all and here's where we really start to see the ... side of the crown prince he\nWanted to make fundamental changes to the economy and quickly and it's part of that he wanted to fight corruption is a way to bring in foreign investment but it was way that he did it that's become emblematic of how he operates instead of using laws in court he\nRounded up more than two hundred Saudi businessmen and princes and government ministers and he held them at the Ritz Carlton hotel for more than three months until they paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get out\nNow most people would say that's probably not a good way to attract foreign investment in fact I Would probably do just the opposite which it appears have done I'm thinking\nAlso some of his recent moves on the international stage of the war and the men were Saudi Arabia has carried out a ... I think ... percent largely indiscriminate bombing campaign and then there was the situation with the prime minister of Lebanon remind\nUs what he had a minister Saad Hariri ah he was visiting and Saudi Arabia and he was detained by the crown prince to think about it detaining sitting prime minister well he's visiting your country um that's how I built him a reputation for being reckless in a bully and many of the analysts that I've talked to over the past few months\nThinks this is because he just doesn't think through or recognize the repercussions of what he's doing 'em and perhaps he doesn't have a great world view and you know he ... he didn't travel abroad very much unlike most other Saturday elites and so perhaps he doesn't have a keen sense of geopolitics\nCircle back to that tape of your interview with ... where he said he doesn't think the crown prince ... we watch any counter opinion is a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually all over the many months now I he's rounded up religious figures economists activists including those who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned\nAnd he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um and that included from ... you know he saw the handwriting on the wall he had to leave the country because of that and how what are they ready to come here and I had to you know he had to leave Saudi Arabia come here and you know given what's happened is suspected murder\nWill have to wait and see whether the crown princes repressive tendencies are even worse than what people were

U. teen years\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly when hurricane Michael barreled through Florida it also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and the critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and US Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nThere meanwhile Harris his opponent this is Republican Ron dissent is on his way to the panhandle to help out ... years\nWhy why several we know\nThe folks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... he's the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott at sea bass gay welcome to the program thank you so much for hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nHad a major effect and the governor's race race to the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor who's the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm\nAnd the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency to sort of a help the state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a ... first lady\nHas stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Rick Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee Rick Scott though he's not formally campaigning\nHe was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaigning\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest to copy of the ball and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone\nThere are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking Governor Scott issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but every one boat would be protected\nHas the hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on I mean I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls but hurricane Michael ... was a part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which was of course linked to climate change\nSo I'm skeptical whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and us that\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling\nNearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning\nIs it reinforces to people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're great ... although they're getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government of trying to give people a you know oh\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on politics and at Florida State by state thanks so much Thanks Mary Louise\nObamacare won't be on ballots in next month's elections but the fate of the eight year old health care law and other ambitious healthcare initiatives could be decided depending on which party wins control of Congress NPR's\nScott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign ad\nI don't talk about it much but does he face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nBlast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and his requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nI played the role of translator an advocate for my family and for my parents and how that really developed my sense of social responsibility and my sense of wanting to do work that would have a contribution to my community and the people who need that most [noise] how\nDo you think Harvard's admissions policies helped you or affected you as an applicant to be a student\nWhen I was applying to college I\nI remember getting a lot of really confusing and conflicting advice I mean for one thing I think my counselor said people with higher scores don't get into Ivy League schools really consider some backups\nAnd another counselor who said don't write an Asian immigrant story don't write something that's already been told before that's been heard before and it isn't going to be compelling\nAnd I think those two things were really unsettling I think at the time to think that there is this idea that\nMy story or make Syrian says would not be valued or would not be interesting\nAnd you know with scores that weren't valedictorian scores it was a really tough find to be in despite that\nI I decided to seek most honestly about what made me why am and when I you'd made missions file and major viewers really kind of saw the value in the ways in which I was making these connections from experience as to what I Want to do\nIf a student says to look I Want to be judged on my merits alone I Want to be judged solely on my accomplishments how do you respond to that\nI think there is a really beautiful fine at the valley that I helped organize and said merit means nothing without context conversations on campus have evolved\nA lot to reflect this idea that we should\nYou know beyond this case rethink how we are structuring our education systems and how we are viewing merit as if it is something that is reflective through test scores through reductive quantitative methods only the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nThere seems to be a good chance that this case could reach the Supreme Court where there appears to be a solid majority opposed to affirmative action what are your fears about what happens if this lawsuit proceeds\nI think knowing that you know when it reaches the Supreme Court they won't take additional evidence\nSo student boy that comes through here will be the only place that they hear when it gets to the top there\nWhichever way this case ends up being decided I think that in the long term thinking about how I think I Want to get a message to future applicants that their stories matter and that they have mattered\nSelling temp thanks so much thank you so much she's and Harvard's class of two thousand Nineteen and she's co director of the task force on Asian
