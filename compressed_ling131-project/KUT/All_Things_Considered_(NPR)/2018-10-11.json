Saudi journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped or maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose but who is or was ... and why would he have been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime\nAt such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion or\nWe're going to put those questions now to Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution welcome Hi thanks for having me God have you with us All right we know some basic facts Jamal 'cause she'll give age fifty nine or that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government and Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support\nNew Saudi policies under a new leadership and he left Saudi Arabia in June twenty Seventeen\nHe went into exile he came to the yeah came to the U.S and started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader ... had been selling man also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he supported some of the general reforms that MBBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that if Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people have to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and NBS in particular increasingly moved in a direction where they didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd ... he couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained\nTo have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote what he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting to put himself into danger\nYou know I don't know if we can point to one moment but I think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post the fact that he knew many and the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively\nUm casts doubt on ... been selling man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen Mohammed bin Salman minor NBS as he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformers that America should hit just wagging to this is interesting\nBecause because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin Salman is taking at what you're describing is why he might have\nBeen seen as a as a more of a danger than others at that he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and and outside of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah and he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticize Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim out there shaggy a did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family does\nIt strike you as puzzling though I mean the records are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigators saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with\nThe express purpose of targeting 'cause she'll get that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor it sounds so crazy\nThat it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nI think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario rights\nOh I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\n[noise] Shadi Hamid thanks so much for having me and my

an angry mob is actually in the car and Bob\nUh declared the mall but angry mob that was not what I said about our Democrat colleagues\nI Do think that they encourage a what went on and the Congress

I'm pretty optimistic will be able to hold our majority\nThere is a talk at one point in time about no dissecting where the office for happening for Republicans particularly in the Hispanic community is it time for that to happen again\nWell I don't think there's any question that we would like to be doing better than we are with a Hispanic Americans although some of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in America I happen to be Republicans with regard to women voters we've always had something of a ... a\nFish never been as wide as it is now we have two great women running for the Senate

been able to make much although I think it is noteworthy that uh attempt Scott there's a member of our conference and he's the arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina so\nHope with African American voters as well but I'm a more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position was a Spanish\nYou're looking ahead we ... we talked to three and a half weeks away from this election how many Republicans will be in the Senate next year\nNow you know I'm not going to ask [laughter] I'd say out of their production business\nSometimes to non answers are telling that was Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell speaking with our Kelsey Snell on Capitol Hill today and Kelsey was there anything else he just wouldn't answer\nWell yeah I think it's important to note that this\nIs a little longer interview that we had a head down for a time and he and I talked about a lot\nAnd one of the things he did that really struck me is that he voted criticizing President Trump at ... and most issues particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the fed is crazy for raising interest rates McConnell just wouldn't go there\nAnd in that section about health care when we heard him say it was a major failure he didn't say it's a fight he wants to repeat and that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear they wanted to hear that and Republicans are going to go back\nIf they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act and on that same issue we got into an extended conversation about Republicans protections for people with preexisting conditions on come\nTo Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response about how they can support those lawsuits but still wants protections in place\nOne thing that looked out at me listening they're back to your health care point he described as a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment and I was thinking I I can think of others I mean what about comprehensive immigration reform they wanted to get that done a lot of time\nThat really wasn't on his list and you know I hadn't been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to a who worked on immigration many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the year potentially around spending\nI'm speaking of spending and speaking of immigration did you ask about the border wall which people are talking about again funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico\nYeah I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over the border wall with Mexico he says he wants to try to get funding for the wall but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans he\nSaid about you know money for about one year roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether and now that's not the down payment or major investment that some in the house are talking about and that is what sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation other big spending fight other thing\nThat you that you raised with him was women and where women are left coast Kavanaugh's confirmation battle he acknowledge that there's always been something of a gender gap in terms of voters for ... for Republicans would acknowledge that is going to be a challenge\nYeah absolutely and he said that he is going to make an effort to get more women on the Senate Judiciary committee next year he says he's asked in the past and he's going to ask again\nAll right NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell

joins us now from Panama City one of the places hardest hit by the storm communications are still difficult there but we think we have the right Debbie hey they're right I'm here\nTo tell us why did it like there now\nWell it's utter destruction and you know I've covered a lot of hurricanes and then there's probably one of a you know the ones I have I\nWould say are in the top ranked in terms of just every where you look there is something wrong nothing is right um you know people here talk a little bit about losing their bearings in some places because things are gone\nTrees are snapped into their down everywhere they're on top and through all kinds of structures\nThat huge metal light posts are just twisted like they're a crumpled papers straw ribs have been ripped from buildings windows have been blown out and when you try to go down any street um they're covered by fell trees or power poles\nThey're also all kinds of debris on the roadways their power lines down just random stuff like street signs or glass or a chunk of the billboard it's a it's very difficult terrain\nWow what a picture you just painted what about rescue efforts how are they going so far\nWell uh it's been difficult to get to people but there were underway I'm right now ... that the the that those bought lift things I'm the word I'm losing it but they're trying to clear the roads of all the stuff so that emergency vehicles can get through there are lots of power trucks here\nBut the power trucks can't get to work of course until\nUm the the that things are back out of the way for them to get to where they can put the power lines back up\nSo right now it's just a matter of trying to get everything out of the way so that that the work to for recovery can began\nBut the bigger issue is getting to people who need help\nAnd have you been able to talk to a lot of people affected by hurricane I mean how are they holding up\nYou know I think right now people are just trying to figure out what's next for them um I went to this apartment complex and Lynn haven which is just north of Panama City um and it's a mess you know you can see the top rooms open to the sunlight because of the roof being gone and treat them\nI talked with Tonya Robin ... who stays there with her family um she says she's homeless than than living with them and she can't believe what she thinks she's a native of Panama City\nThe devastation out here it's horrific that is I mean I'm ... and this is so much shop because I'm never seen this happen in Panama City before\nNow managers that we keep seeing here are of complete destruction but can you can you give us a more accurate scale of the damage right now [noise]\nYou know there is no count or anything but the kinds of things they're facing there's water boil notice so you can't but you can't really blew your water if you don't have power\nUm unless you have a way to set up a fire so those kinds of problems are what are facing people\nAll right That's NPR's Debbie Elliott in Panama City Florida thank you daddy You're welcome\nTo another story now millions of Americans post our ancestry information online new research is showing just how easy it is for law enforcement to use this data to zero in on relatives who may have committed a crime NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details\nPolice made headlines last spring when they finally nabbed a suspect for a series of brutal rapes and murders and California from the Nineteen seventies and eighties\nHas the same killer finally the cash for California investigators Jed match dot com to named Joseph James Dean Angelo as a setback genealogy website to try to identify the notorious homes they killer\nAnd that was just the beginning police around the country of started doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people that database or white\nEach person in that debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of ... so it's enough to have your third cousin or your second cousin once removed and do stuff that they did to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS you than you did multiples because I like to find a location\nYou know but ten years before the first official coming out day coming out was really made a political action by Harvey Milk a name I'm sure you know\nRight the first openly gay member of the ... the board of supervisors exactly he was an icon for the community and in this speech he gave in Seventy eight he basically call them all of America to come out\nThey gave her [noise]\nCome out [noise]\n\nGoing to have your your mom so\nClearly you know you have Harvey Milk here stake in this line in the sand but if you really want to get to where the energy for the gay rights movement and coming out came from\nYou could track at all the way back to where the root for the civil rights movement and gay rights movement and women's rights movement came from which was post World war two activism started by black soldiers okay\nSo you're taking it all the way back down to in the Nineteen forties\nHarvey Milk like this huge inspiration in the seventies then coming out day gets foreign allies in the eighties eighties I mean this is a form of life in this decade that was that was turbulent and scary and and really heartbreaking for much of the gay community\nYeah in many ways it was awful for the gay community and this was in the throes of the AIDS crisis you had this groundswell of activism from the algae ... community over the issue while the government was very silent\nOr in the same decade in eighty six you had the Supreme Court uphold a state law from Georgia again sodomy which allowed gay sex to be treated as a family and so the thinking was if coming out day was the thing that happened and it proved that people had gay and lesbian folks in their lives everywhere and you know them\nSome of the way the law treated them or ignored them would have to change\nIt feels like a lot has changed I mean let me ask you is coming out the same kind of moment now to marketing it coming out day feel as necessary\nYeah I think the answer depends on who you ask but for me it feels very very different in large part\nBecause the language that we have around sexuality and gender is constantly evolving you know a thing that we talk about in the episode is how the increased prominence of queer identity of trans identity\nOf people declaring themselves and their sexuality in these ways that are new to many people\nThat almost doesn't fit what you could call the old model of coming out and there's also you know this phenomenon we'd go we go from Ellen coming out some Twenty years ago I went to artist exactly to artist like Frank Ocean\nWho came out but didn't use the word gay or Janelle Monet who didn't come out as gay or lesbian or by she came out as pan sexual\nIt's just a different language and a different rubric almost so of course that just changes what coming out is did you walk\nAway from forming an opinion about\nYourself [noise] um I think it helped me in my own coming out story to stop being\nAngry about how long it took or feeling guilty about my path in my process and just feeling a bit more proud of who I Am and there's I don't know there was this feeling throughout the entire episode where the listeners we talked to coming out is not just declaring yourself\nTo the world it is declaring herself to every earlier version of yourself and tell him that person they're cool too

Republican strategy might be taking shape right before the midterms a Whit Ayres is a pollster who has advised Republicans for years welcome back to the program Mr airs good to be here\nSo we just heard the president they're talking about a left wing mob a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called the protesters a mob Senator Marco Rubio has been tweeting he treated over the weekend saying imagine what the cable news coverage would have looked like if an angry mob of conservatives had stormed the steps of the Supreme Court so\nWhat do we think is going on here [noise]\nThe Kavanaugh confirmation battle United the center right coalition unlike any event during the Trump presidency other than the Gorsuch nomination and part of the reason for that or the loud protests so the tactics with a left ultimately undermine their cause\nJust take a step back with me for a minute we all talk about the lack of civility in Washington these days as a direct question but does calling once political opponents a mob\nHow\nI figured is symptomatic of the politics of our age [noise] is it\nThe president's responsibility leading the entire country to try to rise above the

[laughter] why not without getting myself in trouble [noise]\nLet me put it this way there are practical consequences of hardening battle lines and wild no party has blameless in Washington these days it makes it harder and harder to cross party lines and actually\nGet anything done yes it does and\nOrder to actually get something done we're gonna have to have people like our clients and the Senator Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander and John Kennedy who will\nReach across the aisle and form bipartisan coalitions and these are all kinds of ours was our clients have done repeatedly and will continue to do\n[noise] you mentioned Lindsey Graham is one of your clients yes he had quite the turning the Kavanaugh hearing where he came out about as angry as I've ever seen him know me too yeah how do we square that with the politics of getting reelected the politics of doing the right thing in terms of the country\nI don't think it's any more complicated than the Kavanaugh hearings bringing out in Tempe emotions\nOn all ... and I guess the circles us back to my original question of have the Kavanaugh hearings coalesced into a different strategy as Republicans look at these last four weeks for Americans go to vote\nNo I don't think it's coalesced into a different strategy what it is done is unite the various parts of the Republican center right coalition in
