Supreme Court is more than a political tug of war in Washington DC it's another vivid illustration of the divided culture of American politics in an era in which compromise and consensus of being discovered\nThat atmosphere division permeates the campaign for the midterm elections next month's elections which will decide which party controls Congress\nJames knocked the reports from the state

Republican strategist who was at the heart of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in twenty twelve identifies the shift to identity politics that's being strengthened by the Trump phenomena\nRight now I think you see many folks that are much more interested in defining our politics by what we're against and then drawing very stark contrast with our opponents\nOn that was why you're seeing fewer and fewer debates about big policy discussions in more debates\nAbout cultural issues we have debates in Washington\nThat our focus not on things that you can actually solve with policy instead they're focused on things like flag burning or the national anthem things like that that are just designed to sort of find out where does this candidates stand with me on some of the issues that we can break

going to do business or because they're building Planned Parenthood facility I don't think there's a progressive politician in the country who wouldn't get up\nAnd eviscerate a politician backing as a

Austin on line and Katie's outward\nOf any kind of no place in the United states of America\nPresident Trump says a major federal investigation underway on suspicious packages to current and former government officials It's Wednesday October twenty four and this is all things considered\nI Know that change this hour we'll talk with a former ATF agents about how the bureau would typically investigate an explosive device later look at sweeping legislation to address the opioid epidemic when is the rare issues for bipartisan teamwork\nI guess maybe because the severity of the crisis people are willing to work together and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nAnd the war in Yemen is getting worse the un says the country's on the brink of a massive famine\nThere is now a clear and present danger of an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen ...\nI'm Republicans or Democrats had been killed um this was an attack on our country\nUm our institutions I'm an an attack on the media uh and I think that that's how investigators are viewing at this game day they've trained for this their whole career and they will solve this case I don't know how long it will take\nA but this is a big deal I'm and we're just grateful that no one has been injured to date and there's a mountain of evidence because these devices did not go off\nBut in trying to figure out the motivation behind these attacks you say that the party affiliation of the targets wouldn't be relevant to this point\nClearly it's worthy of speculation I all I'm saying is is when I arrived at the Oklahoma City scene it was two years earlier that I was working at the world Trade Center bombing\n'em in the back of my mind I just assumed that this was a foreign terrorist attack that blew up the ... uh the Oklahoma City ... federal building it turned out it was not it was a fellow American\nSo I think that what you'll find is that the professionals\nAre just looking at the evidence they want to link the the bombs together or they want to see how it was delivered all they want to develop clues and I'm not saying that they're not blocking out the clear linkage in the you know the the problematic targets\nBut at this point they've got all this evidence um usually a bomb goes off and you don't have all these clues\nHow else might investigators try to establish whether these devices are linked we we know that they arrived in different locations along the east coast\nYeah so um every bomber makes things a certain way you know it ... you could see that same components being used\nOr sometimes they're tool marks sometimes there'll be fire fibers in there sometimes you might even get DNA or a fingerprint um you know it looks like in some of the photos I've seen on the Internet that uh uh the address was printed out and um yeah I Will be able to compare those to see if a similar device was used\nSo I ... I feel confident that they'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be can you link it back to a person or persons unknown and I know they're really looking at how were these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that that does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still routine fingerprints for example\nAnd that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another an explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this'll be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be in the mail not yet a delivered we saw this in central Texas recently\nOr devices were going overtime alright that's David shipment former special agent for the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives thank you very much for coming in today\nYou're listening to all things considered on K U T Ninety point five an attack on our country our institutions and the media those words from and then we just heard from former ATF agent David shipment highlighting what has emerged today as a broad consensus that\nThe partisan divisions in this country are in many instances becoming\nToo extreme [noise] we hear K U T\nSpent all day trying to bring you news in a calm and civil fashion we present you with information we allow you to make up your own mind you won't always agree with everything you hear on K.

Jamal ... jeep\nMore them to the gym yesterday\nSpeaking at a conference in Riyadh the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killing prompted many western CEOs to cancel their plans to attend this high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance but\nMany of us business executives did show up and to find out more about what had happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me\nSome first talking about what this conferences for the Saudis want global companies to invest their money in the king and that's the basic object in right\nExactly oh the future investment initiative and it's the second year that they've done that it's become known sort of colloquially as the ... and the desert a conference and drawing about three thousand people last week or wow world\nAnd in part of the deal is the Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know efforts to make Saudi Arabia hub for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNow does your of course the killing of democracy ... cast a shadow over the conference today the crown prince directly confined to the issue in his comments what what'd you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting but it was kind of wondering first of all whether or not he was speaker not him he did whether or not he would address the situation and uh he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he did promise to bring ever did it to justice I think that was his attempt to try and I lay concerns a among people from all around the world who think it's sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince is speaking today it\nWas a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince he got a standing ovations um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up any who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from my jeep mark in and Goldman Sachs we're not there are\nSome of the benefits and lower level executives but I think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing the names on there need to find their ties are keeping their jackets buttoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot and\nThe more people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense a people that I spoke to\nThat you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and they didn't want us our relations with the Saudis and I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be notice or make a statement so they felt like\nThey were going to go and see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point it exactly what did happen and you know until the investigation as conclusive\nThey were going to get the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the ...\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks and biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away ... potential damage the brand\nAs well companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know\nEthical investing the defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference I think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and this is such a important market for them to be involved in I think it would be economically and just for them to step away\nThat's Allan Rapaport of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nIn Washington the Senate Judiciary committee considered for more of President Trump's judicial nominees today but two senators attended the hearing that is because the Senate is in recess NPR national\nJustice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nThe entire hearing was over in less time than an episode of law and order

describing your columns as an aspiring sports agent is sort of middle man what argument did these defendants try to me to explain why these payments they made to the players were legal\n[noise] well they never believe that they were they admitted they violated NCA rules\nRight but ... that they didn't violate the law\nDid not violate the law and their belief was look we we worked for Adidas and we have players who played for a Dieter sponsored summer and a new basketball teams and we steer them to schools that have signed contracts endorsement contracts with Adidas\nAnd we're not trying to hurt those schools like Kansas or Louisville and we're trying to help them\nBy giving them a great player so that was there a case the fed said now\nBy giving you by paying players you have rendered them ineligible and loss when those players get to the school the schools the schools are at risk for NC double a sanctions and not those schools have been defrauded and because those schools receive federal funds it's a federal case and the government won that\nSold a lot of evidence was presented in court over the past few weeks what were some of the new details that came to light about about how this kind of player recruitment works give us some details\n[noise] well I think almost anybody who's seen the movies or or follow college sports at all those players get paid\nIn the recording process to pick a school mhm I'm certainly the details of just how high tech it is it's less about a boosters giving money or a hundred dollar handshakes or any of the old kind of ideas as much as it's\nA multi national shooting apparel company wiring forty thousand dollars thirty thousand dollars to\nTwo people died in an effort to bring them over high school kids this includes one of the

have already played and moved on to the NBA but kids have had to sit out a year and things like that\nAh and it's only really affected a few college coaches most notably Rick Pitino but not not too many so there has not been widespread suspensions or anything like that although the NCAA investigated there's certainly could be\nThat Dan Wetzel columnist for Yahoo Sports thank you very much for

basketball corruption trial you know that if something happens and it's big news NPR's going to be on it and they have really improved they're breaking news coverage especially over the past couple of

...\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station from NPR\nNews this is all things considered I notice that change it's been three weeks and a day since dissident Saudi journalist ... show she went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince or said whether he believes NBS and he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic of the Saudi king and its policies and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator Todd Young it's called the crown prince impulsive and reckless\nAnd says the U.S should send the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.S incentives Saudi Arabia right now\n[noise] um it's crystal clear Americans won't stand for this sort of behavior we've seen in recent weeks and I would say over the last couple of years of the behavior coming from\nThe Saudi Government and more specifically from the Saudi air a parent a prince Mohammed is contrary to our values our international laws in our national security interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust in Solomon's pledge to reform its country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of years in Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like\nStates a graduate or ... in Washington Post journalist so these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlights but we need to begin holding the government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on honing Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress having calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the conference to be replaced do you agree that that would be a good step\nWell look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know I've been involved\nIn this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out uh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more\nAnd we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in this sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms the Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if this White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\n[noise] look I think that the number of jobs are the ... be levy loss from this ah are frankly fairly minor ah I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here the\nCountry of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action that country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe've talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the presidents do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh geez that\nWell I think uh the president's message as these gather more information or it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts\nAre that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mom does that concern you\nKnow we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing\nThat the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide as valuable intelligence but I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined as the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a violations of our fundamental values as they strongly appear to have done a in this instance and that could show be killing\nShelbyville has seen a big influx of immigrants in the last Twenty years voters like ... pulled me they're worried about crime\nBecause there have been people

Richard is in fact the state issue drivers certificates to undocumented immigrants years ago reticent ended the practice after he took office\nAnd in recent years Tennessee has passed some of the toughest anti immigrant laws in the country\nAt a recent debate in Knoxville reticent said he's a border hawk even if he doesn't agree with President Trump\nI Believe very strongly in controlling our borders but I think there are much better ways of doing it in building a wall to wall is sort of political theater\nBut Marsha Blackburn clearly sides with the president\nLet me tell you something Tennessee and want to see that wall built because open border policies have made every town a border town in every state uh borders eight\nBlackburn has been a longtime immigration hawk representing Tennessee in the house her critics say black burn and Trump are trying to exploit fears about immigrants who are no more likely to commit crimes than anyone else\nCertainly think candidates like Trump

whatever you're doing out there stop for a minute because astrophysicist Adam Frank has some good news for you and you don't even need it telescope to see it he says no matter how crazy world me feel take heart in its molecular order\nThe good News I'm bringing you comes from the universe itself and you can find it in something as simple as a single grain of salt actually it's not a grain of table salt I Want you to focus on what the molecular structure making up that great\nSee every salt molecule is made of exactly one atom of the elements sodium and one atom of element chlorine\nFat never changes and what might seem a little weird I'm here to tell you that we can take great comfort in that tiny atomic fact\nYou're the solve your income laying solved it might have some extra additives in there like iodine and there are other compounds that scientists like to call salt but no matter what the sodium chloride molecules and your salt shaker are always hooked together in exactly the same way that never changes\nAnd it's a conscience that means that every molecule salt as exactly the same properties as every other molecule salt in the entire universe\nThrough all of space and all of time off salt molecules look the same they moved the same and most importantly they behave the same see at the rock bottom basement level of the universe\nThings are not a mess instead there's a kind of angels singing in the cloud sublime order that science reveal to us and every molecule of salt has a shape and a behavior that is intern perfectly specified\nThey are like beautiful cosmic lego blocks clicking together in the most perfect way and this never ever change is\nThe fact that all Adams everywhere across the universe display this perfect unchanging lego block order is why the reliability of chemistry as possible it's nature can start with tiny items and use them to build all the other things that make up the wonder of life around us\nYou know stuff like mountains in oceans slime molds and sequoia trees spiders and cocker spaniel dolphins and elephants all that wonderful and complex stuff exists because perfect simple atomic rules live at the world's smallest and most invisible levels\nSo yes humans and dark conflicts can be a horrible mess but we should never forget that below all that mess has a cosmic order that's far outlast our brief moment on earth and it's

I feel confident that they'll be able to link these devices but then the real work will be can you link it back to a person or persons unknown and I know they're really looking at how were these delivered\nAnd the fact that none of these devices actually exploded that that that does help investigators right when the devices are still intact and might still retain fingerprints for example\nAbsolutely and that's why the um the first responders are are taking so much time to render these devices safe\nWithout destroying the evidence it's not like they're going to put another an explosive device next to it and blow it to smithereens they have techniques used to preserve evidence this'll be important as the investigation unfolds but right now\nThere are devices that could be in the mail not yet the uh delivered we saw this in central Texas recently were devices were going overtime\nAlright that's David shipment former special agent for the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives thank you very much for coming in today\nYou're listening to all things considered on K U T Ninety five a former ATF agent chip and their referencing the bomb attacks that we had here in the Austin area recently and it reminded me of these breaking news situations where we have to be so careful\nAbout getting the facts right because with respect to these bombs stories today there's been a lot of false reports and misinformation and that's why here AT T T and with NPR\nWe want to bring you the breaking news but we would rather be five minutes later Fifteen minutes late and get the facts right then be first\nAnd wrong and that's what you're helping to support when you become our next member today and K.
