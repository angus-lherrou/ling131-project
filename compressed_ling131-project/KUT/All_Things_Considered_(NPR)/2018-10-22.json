overstepped their orders but for the torch sites they are trying to continue piling up the pressure especially on the Saudi Government\nSaid did they explain ... how they think they know that these full phone calls were made to the office of the crown prince\nThe sauce over these leaks are kept really vaguely but what we can issue more what we can say is that this is given these journals directly by the Turkish officials\nThey also say that a phone call was placed at around the same time to the United states from that same office\nThey talked to someone that the structure of shoes

the U.S border deny President Trump's claim that terrorists are with them It's Tuesday October twenty second and this is all things considered\nI'm Audie Cornish and I know that change the president

to call up the U.S military and closed the southern border altogether\nJust like if the president would be able to follow through on these threats we're joined now by NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House Hey Scott I also so can the president on his own cut off aid to Central American countries or does he first need cooperation from Congress\nThe president does have some latitude to curtail aid payments lawmakers might not like that the top Democrat on the house foreign affairs committee has already laws to protest\nBut presidents in the past have used this power to hold up to countries they don't believe are acting in U.S interests\nNow aside from his authority some of the experts I spoke with said it would be counterproductive for President Trump to follow through on this trip they say cutting off aid might just make conditions in the Central American countries worsen create an even bigger push for people to try to pack up and escape to the north\nNow has called on Mexico to stop the caravan and said that if that doesn't happen he will call up the U.S military and closed the southern border I mean he is commander in chief so can he unilaterally do that\nTrump and other presidents have mobilized the national guard in the past uh usually in cooperation with state governors\nYou might remember that President Trump mobilized about four thousand guard troops this past spring to lend a hand with more security in general those guard troops have been playing a support role they're not actually patrolling were sealing the border but also that's not really the point you know the migrants the president's been talking about\nAre not as a rule trying to evade the border patrol on the country they had been deliberately turning themselves in when they reach the border and asking for asylum so it's not really clear what bringing in more troops would actually accomplish\nHe's trying to turn away migrants if they don't first apply for asylum in Mexico can enforce that\nLongstanding federal and international law says immigrants who present themselves at the border\nHave the right to seek protection as refugees at least to apply for it and that's what many of these Central American migrants have been doing many of them are also doing so in family groups and that has posed a challenge for the administration because of limits we've talked a lot about on detaining young people for example\nWe've seen a surge in the number of family groups crossing the border illegally but we have to keep this in perspective overall the level of illegal border crossings is still way down from its high point around the year two thousand\nAnd finally as we heard in the interview with reporter James Frederick migrant advocates are refuting Trump's description of the Caribbean is being led by Democrats what you know about that charge are these threat just a ploy I hadn't been a term elections\nThe president has been claiming without evidence the Democrats want open borders a lot of Democrats a point to the two thousand Thirteen bipartisan bill that passed the Senate that actually would have substantially\nBeefed up border security but that said this is certainly an energizing issue for the president's base and so it's no surprise you stressing it not only on his Twitter feed but at the campaign rallies he's been holding around the country with just over two weeks to go before the midterm elections All right\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley thanks Scott\nYou're welcome you're listening to all things considered on K U T Ninety point five a hearing

weren't friends\nI didn't care made it like\nTrump recounted the moment during another recent about a rally Heller ultimately came around supporting the failed repeal effort and then helping orchestrate one more push to undo the law a couple of months later he says working with Trump on health care and other issues created a real bond\nWhat happened was success he became president United States we started working together we started working together and it built trust\nWhen you have successive builds trust when you build trust is built friendships\nTrump put it another way then we started to like each other then we started to love each other\nA close relationship with Trump is an asset if a Republican wants to survive a primary challenge these days it's not clear how that

computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art\nHouse now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale and\nShe joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we can set our art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine all by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right and it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for\nThe twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nA covered criminal justice for the New York times for almost Fifteen Years and I had written the previous book about a black family with multiple generations of criminals\nAnd I wanted to find a white family which could illustrate this because some of the studies were were done so long ago but most of the all the people and some of the study is for the one in Boston for example were all white and I wanted to see if I could take race out of the equation to disentangle race from crime\nSo let's talk about the family you focused on in this book there the moguls um they're white as you already mentioned they're poor you trace their family all the way back to right after the civil war and\nYou discover sixty members of the family ended up in prison or jail or some juvenile reform ... which is just staggering in and out itself\nYes it sounds like something that a ... believe it or not and the people who did the statistical studies that found that five percent of families account for half of all crime that they never went the next step and looked at individual families to see why crime spreads and families\nHow did you find the vocal specifically\nWell it was really an accident and a friend of mine who worked in the Oregon department of corrections called me one day and we were talking and I asked him if he knew of a white family with a significant number of prisoners\nIn it and he said I'll have to call you back and he did a couple of days and he said I've got family there are white and I think they've got six members who who are now are have been in prison but we had no idea that point that they were as many sixty who had been in prison or jail\nNow the patriarch that use zero in on in this book is a man named rooster Bogle can you tell us about him how as a father and as a husband rooster Bogle hoped to reinforce the terrible choices members of his family were making\n... rooster took a lot of pride in being tough\nAnd having committed a crime which landed him in in prison in Texas\nWhen he was only Seventeen and he wanted his sons to grow up to be at least as tough as he wasn't as bad as he was and remind us what was his first arrest for his first arrests was for a burglary of the local a grocery store and he was living in Amarillo, Texas\nAnd in fact almost everybody in the family participated in the burglary including a ... mother and one of roosters sisters as well as all his brothers\nAnd they they made off with twenty thousand dollars which doesn't seem like a lot now but and in Nineteen sixty it was a lot of money yeah\nBut it was like a family day it was like going on a picnic or something\nYes exactly going on a when a picnic a barbeque in Texas\n[laughter] but as ... grew older he continued his criminal behavior and the family he raised he taught them that it was kind of a badge of honor to get in trouble with the law\nYes and he would he would take these kids out and commit crimes of them they would break into their neighbors' homes or they would break into their mailboxes and take their Social Security checks they would steal people's cows and chickens\nOr they would go into a lumber yard and take lumber would sure they would refill or anything that they could do and a one incident the kid's talked about was the one night he had organized his entire family including his wife\nSons and daughters and they go onto the bugs will damage big dam on the Columbia River outside of Portland and going into the fish hatchery and stolen all the Cohen Chinook salmon that they could find in the fish hatchery there and loaded them in their truck and drove them home and either eight them are sold them\nBut it was more than just adventures and shenanigans I mean you explore a very dark side to the way Brewster raised his family there was rampant physical abuse sexual abuse psychological abuse\nWhich leads me to the ultimate question what's the more powerful force when it comes to shaping criminal behavior did you find it was genetic or family values\nI started out looking at family values\nWhat was obvious in talking to the moguls was that they were very conscious of imitating the behavior of their father end of the aunts and uncles and grandmother and grandfather\nWho met criminal records and then they did not have any what criminologist we call social controls so they didn't go to church on Sunday school we didn't belong to any organization like the boy scouts they didn't have a\nAdult role models but beyond that I began to get interested in and if there was any role of genetics and this in criminology has been a no no or taboo subject for a long time\nBecause it can dangerously threatened to the question of how race yes city turning criminality\nSo there were in recent years certainly since the voting of the human genome some scientists began to look at behavioral genetics and there was a professor at Duke who is a criminologist and her work indentified several genes which could be precursors\nTo impulsivity which is a characteristic of a lot of criminals but she stresses that there's no such thing as a criminal gene which in combination with the environment so if you have a family environment like the moguls and you have this variant of the gene\nThen you have kind of a double whammy\nI Want to end our conversation as un did your book um by talking about Ashley she's rooster vocals granddaughter she was kind of the aberration in his family she's a good student she wants to do good she became the first member of the ... and a hundred and fifty years to go to college\nWhen I graduated from college and graduate from college what did you learn from Ashley story\nThat as she herself says it's a matter of individual choice in the end she chose not to do what she saw around her she didn't like what was happening to everybody else in her family\nSo she decided to try to stick to a good path and that she can break the cycle she broke his leg will end up in her case she had a little help because\nHer mother was actually the daughter of a policeman in a prison guard and a grandmother who was a nurse so she had some very good influences in her family that would help to overcome some of it\nBogle side of her family box letter ... new book is called him my father's house new view of how

professor civil engineering Mary joke here so it's\nSo they could be masquerading as part of this silt and some of it you know if it makes it through the process now you've got these organisms out

the Chang and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump declared over the weekend that the U.S is pulling out of the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed this treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nBut the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president is NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio ... okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's still provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\n[noise] of course Ronald Reagan Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deals he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response from the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei ... cuff was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmailed by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U. S. spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remembered thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ministry she might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and probably like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to join the IMF to us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies\nThrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again after all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting your\nWell commodity residents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by hurricane Michael\nAs a snapshot of where they stand now twelve days after the storm about Seventy thousand customers remain without power some water and sewer systems are not working\nAnd cell phone service is spotty a complete breakdown in communication during and after the storm cripple the emergency response and now it hinders recovery\nNPR's Debbie Elliott reports\nGym now than lives in all sorts of Florida a small rural town about sixty miles inland has property looks as if a tornado came through trees are down everywhere including one that fell through the roof of his house he\nSays he wasn't prepared for the strength that hurricane Michael\nWho's been there forty five years and now we've had hair canes but we'll never had nothing as far inland like this\nAnd he says he's certainly never been cut off from the outside world like that\nSays no communication there and the cell phone might come on our and golf and be all for six hours or more you never knew when it was coming and going\nFamily could not get in touch after the storm to know that he survived that's been a major problem throughout the region where hundreds of people have been reported missing because the phones aren't working it's also hampered search and rescue operations because first responders couldn't talk to one another\nYes the prosecutor explains gee how marijuana which is part of our our ... truck she could face felony charges if she doesn't plead guilty she takes the deal it's a situation that supporters\nOf medical marijuana fear could soon play out in courtrooms across the state patients facing prosecution for Canada's oil what goes into everything from edibles debate Pence\nThat's after Arizona second highest court recently upheld the conviction of a man named Rodney Jones a medical marijuana card holder Jones went to prison for having Canada's oil\nShe was certainly acting in his view according to the rules\nThat's attorney Robert Mandela was asking the state Supreme Court to overturn Jones is conviction\nIt seems implausible that the intent of the electorate was that the only way that that medication could be administered to them would be by smoking a joint\nBut that's in effect what the ruling means under the court's logic many of the state's one hundred eighty thousand medical marijuana patients are committing felonies\nClearly there's a lot at stake\nSo how does this happen with a product sold for years even regulated by the state\nThe legal disputes centers on whether Arizona's medical marijuana act first passed by voters as a ballot measure and twenty ten includes canvas extracts Sheila poll the prosecutor and one of the Arizona staunchest photos of marijuana says no in fact it's her office they went after Rodney Jones\nThis case affirmed away candidates has always been treated in this county by my office which is that it's a narcotic drug\nMany dispute her interpretation but it's unclear how many other prosecutors are now following her lead poke believes medical marijuana supporters are taking advantage of the ballot box by pushing initiatives that voters don't fully understand\nThey weren't contemplating manufacturers would be extracting one chemical from that marijuana plant to make that you know mind blowing product\nArizona is a cautionary tale about the possible fallout of using the ballot instead of state legislators to craft marijuana reform law's says Rob make us he's a law professor at Vanderbilt University and says these measures aren't always comprehensive you're opening the door\nTo those opponents to sort of revisit the issue on exploit those gas\nMichigan for example only clarified in twenty sixteen what was legal and their state years after voters passed their medical marijuana measure micro says many lawmakers don't want to get ahead of these disputes\nThe way to practice problem\nYou know these gaps between that the letter and spirit of the marijuana reforms I is to have them addressed first and foremost by legislatures and on professional bureaucrats that that know how to write legislation that deals with an end can anticipate with all all those problems that might come up\nThat did not happen in Arizona in fact a bill aimed at fixing the problem earlier this year never got a hearing for NPR

[laughter] this is Austin's NPR station\nK. U. T. Austin thank you for listening thank you for supporting excellent\nAlso last week Trump threatened to call up the U.S military and closed the southern border altogether\nJust like the president would be able to follow through on these threats we're joined now by NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House Hey Scott I also so can the president on his own cut off aid to Central American countries or defeat first need cooperation from Congress\nThe president does have some latitude to curtail aid payments lawmakers might not like that the top Democrat on the house foreign affairs committee has already laws to protest but presidents in the past have used this power to hold up the countries they don't believe are acting in U.S interests\nNow aside from his authority some of the experts I spoke with said it would be counterproductive for President Trump to follow through on the stress they say cutting off aid might just make conditions in the Central American countries worse and create an even bigger push for people to try to pack up and escape to the north\nNow has called on Mexico to stop the caravan and said that if that doesn't happen he will call up the U.S military and close the southern border I mean he is commander in chief so can he unilaterally do that\nTrump and other presidents have mobilized the national guard in the past uh usually in cooperation with state governors\nYou might remember that President Trump mobilized about four thousand guard troops this past spring to lend a hand with more security in general those guard troops have been playing a support role they're not actually patrolling were sealing the border but also that's not really the point you know the migrants the president's been talking about\nAre not as a rule trying to evade the border patrol on the contrary they had been deliberately turning themselves in when they reach the border and asking for asylum so it's not really clear what bringing in more troops would actually accomplish\nHe's trying to turn away migrants if they don't first apply for asylum in Mexico can enforce that\nLongstanding federal and international law says immigrants who present themselves at the border\nHave the right to seek protection as refugees at least to apply for it and that's what many of the Central American migrants have been doing many of them are also doing so in family groups and that has posed a challenge for the administration because of limits we've talked a lot about on detaining young people for example\nWe have seen a surge in the number of family groups crossing the border illegally but we have to keep this in perspective overall the level of illegal border crossings is still way down from its high point around the year two thousand\nOkay and I've only heard in the interview with reporter James Frederick test right now my grand advocates are refuting Trump's claim that Democrats are to blame for the caravan and what do you know about that are these threats just a ploy headed the ...\nThe the president has been claiming without evidence that Democrats want open borders a lot of Democrats the point to the two thousand Thirteen bipartisan bill that passed the Senate that actually would have substantially beefed up border security\nBut that said this is certainly an energizing issue for the president's base and so it's no surprise he's stressing it not only on his Twitter feed but at the campaign rallies she's been holding around the country\nWith just over two weeks to go before the midterm elections\nAll right That's NPR's Scott Horsley thanks Scott you're ...\nYou're listening to all things considered on K U T Ninety point five first full day of our fall membership Dr\nGetting some sober fact based reporting on a very politically charged issue from NPR's Scott Horsley and you know that's what you're going to get when there's events in the news maybe you get those push alerts during the day when you're at work or otherwise unavailable you see it on your phone\nThere's all sorts of different types of coverage you can get on some of these issues but you know ... you're going to get that NPR coverage that is balanced and fair and isn't trying to push an agenda\nWe have the same philosophy a K. U. T. and that's why I think public radio attracts so many reporters because it's sort of like an idealistic\nThing and a lot of in a lot of respects but\nThe idea that journalism should be\nSober in fact based and not a a device or an instrument to push a political agenda\nWere able to do that to remain independent because our funding comes from people like you we don't have shareholders we have\nMembers well over a ... percent of our revenue comes from the local community less than five percent comes from the federal government through the corporation for public broadcasting that's why it's so important especially now as when when facts\nShow crucial to the public ... people are choosing their leaders based on what they hear on the news that's why now specially we need your support K. U. T. dot org\nWe would love to hear from you this evening a K. U. T. dot O. R. G. or if I went to four seven one six to nine one\nUh you turned asked to help broaden your point of view by bringing new perspectives on a a lot of times the history behind a story so when we're talking about this migrant caravan which seems to be all anybody can talk about on the television news channels right now\nUh it's really interesting when you hear the fact that ah the amount of illegal immigration in this country is so much lower than it was at the high point in two thousand it has dropped dramatically over the years\nBut yet this story is getting so much play but you know that when you come to NPR and it and they're going to sit down and\nBased there reporting on the facts that you really get a better understanding for what's going on and that's why so many people are listening right now so many people are contributing and we hope you'll join those folks it's the last day of our early bird special so if you watch\nThe brand new K.
