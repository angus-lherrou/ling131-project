Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly last name the two U.S Senate candidates from Texas debated in San Antonio three weeks before election day it was an important opportunity for democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke an incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to make their cases to voters\nThat debate like the race was downright nasty as NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports\nSenator Ted Cruz is reelection campaign has not been shy about attacking his opponent congressman Beto O'Rourke on TV\nI'm Ted Cruz and I approved this message medical more is more extreme than he once you didn't\nWant to attack ad which eventually seemed to backfire Cruz's campaign misleading edited video tape to make it appear as if all work said he supported flag burning which he did not say\nFederal works decisions are too extreme for them just to listen for Jackson\nUntil now better or work has declined to participate in negative campaigning but what the polls showing cruise with anywhere from six to nine point lead the congressman relented and has gone on the attack\nRepublicans and Democrats alike know that we've got to lead on immigration reform and Ted Cruz is the only senator to vote against moving forward with that conversation comes down to deport every single dream\nLast night or their debate in San Antonio this trend continues cruised by single Rourke is a dangerous extremist\nIf you work in energy if you work in oil and gas congressman O'Rourke record on this is extreme he didn't just vote for a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil he's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking\nBut I'm like the first debate last night O'Rourke it back\nAnd this is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz and not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and boats that I've never held or ever take is dishonest why the president called on line to and it's why the nickname stuck because it's for\nAlthough cruise would force all laugh when a war attacked him his face revealed is true emotions and the senator didn't like it but the debate in San Antonio was more than just battle it was substantive to\nCruise has the numbers on his side there are hundreds of thousands more Republican voters in Texas the Democrats\nAs a result Cruz spoke mostly to his base\nThe state of Texas is booming we got right now the lowest unemployment in forty nine years Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes in low regulations and congressman O'Rourke position is always always always in favor of higher taxes\nCruise generally played to Republican fears of what would happen if Democrats gained any power or work tended to speak the voters better angels\nWhether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now the partisanship the pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of the national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration\nAlthough we're workers running way ahead of other Texas state wide Democrats close still

factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering what assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that comes down to someone's

where a lot of people are eating well\nA lot of these countries that do suffer from malnutrition also cotton producers so I think those countries will benefit much more from this technology\nTexas a

interpreted so for instance a hearing on Iranian backed militias which has a table of experts from think tanks to specialize in Middle Eastern policy and receive millions of dollars from governments like Saudi Arabia Qatar and urine I'd ever ever since\nWhich really do have an interest in this topic they'll undisclosed [laughter]\nSo this is a long standing practice of a country such as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia providing grants or other donations to big think tanks that are influential where do you do in it thanks so much for stopping by thank you for having me she's an investigator with the project on government oversight\nPresident Trump often criticizes people he has appointed two top jobs in the government lately he's going after someone who sets monetary policy\nThat none of my biggest threat is the fed because the fed is ranging rage too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to them but I'm not happy with what he's doing\nThat with Trump attacking Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on the Fox Business Network last night there is a history of tension between the White House on the fed and NPR's Uri Berliner joins us to tell us more about this ... hello or but start with what's happening right now why is the president going after the chairman of the Federal Reserve\nBut back in July he said he wasn't happy with the fed rate hikes he suggested that they could interfere with the economic\nExpansion and then more recently right after the stock market sell off you complain again some a lot more strenuously you said the fed had gone crazy and was out of control then yesterday he dug up even more saying the fed was his biggest threat\nNow the president's been criticized for these attacks including by some former members of the fed you know they say this can create political pressure that interferes with the feds independent but others say you know the fed is fair game and should really be able to defend its policies if they get criticized\nYeah we heard of that tape Trump saying well the fed is independent so I'm not going to attack them but they're crazy out of control the biggest threat he's not the first president to attack the Federal Reserve tell us more about the history here\nYeah that's true or not it hasn't happened up so much recently but you know back when Lyndon Johnson was president he clashed with his fed chairman William McChesney Martin this was in Johnson was spending a lot on anti poverty programs and the Vietnam War\nMartin was a fiscal conservative and he famously said the Fed's job was to take away the punch bowl just as the party is getting going so they didn't get along and in Nineteen sixty five LBJ someone Martin to his ranch in Texas for a stern talk\nAccording to Martin's oral history LBJ said to him Martin my boys are dying in Vietnam and you won't print the money I Need\nAnd then it was Richard Nixon Nixon pressured fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the run up to the Nineteen Seventy two election or the first President Bush he didn't criticize Alan Greenspan publicly when he was president but years later when he was out of office he said he thought Greenspan cost him his reelection\nSo it sounds like President Trump who's known for violating norms is keeping with a long established an army or is there anything different about these attacks\nHappening now his rhetoric not surprisingly how blood is also it's been very public ah you know I Can't also think of any other prison who said the fed is crazy\nOr what one person is unhappy with the fed is almost always for the same reason presidents want lower rates easier credit flowing through the economy\nThat can boost growth and not coincidentally make presence more popular but that can also lead to inflation presidents don't often worry about inflation central banks do however that's part of their job so there can be this inherent tension between the fed and the White House that can really pick up during an election year\nRight it's independent but also serves kind of at the pleasure of the president is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump\nThere is no indication of that they said it's supposed to be protected from politics and politicians Donald Trump has acknowledged that he's the one who appointed power and that the fed is independent but the fed is really seem to have gotten the fed is really seemed to have gotten under your skin NPRs Ari Berliner thanks for joining us today You're welcome [laughter]\nIt's all things considered from NPR News this is Katie not

negotiators have made so far\nThen the other twenty seven leaders met over dinner without Mrs Maine to decide what to do next NPR psoriasis already Nelson is in Brussels watching the ... and goings at this summit hey Shariah\nHi Mary Louise let me come straight to the basic question which is whether or not they're going to reach a deal before the u._k. scheduled to depart the you this coming march where does that stand\nWell that's the question that nobody seems to be able to answer tonight uh everyone's trying to put on a optimistic face chance or uncle ... tonight said there Ninety percent of the way they're Merkel of Germany go on\nIraq um and ah but the problem is that there is a key sticking point about where to basically put the border between the u._k. and the email you have to have a hard border with customs and passport control and that's what I think the border that they are that they don't want is between Northern Ireland and uh Ireland Ireland being part of the ... in northern\nIreland being part of the u._k.\nAnd so they can't agree though exactly where to put it elsewhere who would run that border that sort of thing and that's what's holding everything up\nAnd it's really frustrating because everybody felt that this week was the week they had to come to a deal in order to get it and acted before brags that happens on march twenty ninth of next year slow that prime minister Peter ... captured the dire or our mood as it were the best\nThing he usually an optimistic person but not today\nMy hope was today we will have already some of the solution on the table but it looks like if you will not be a deal today\nBut he and other leaders are saying that they're keeping an open mind\nWhat about Theresa May the British prime minister she's still sounding optimistic\nI well I Would say she's a cheerleader today I mean she says that the EU case position is still on the table she feels that they're getting close a but she wouldn't say whether she's presenting any new proposals which the council president Donald Tusk and other leaders want\nThat seems to English is very hard and older to ensure that was the address these issues of what we've seen is that we sold the shoes any withdrawal agreement I Believe it's the old FISA she's not as the time to make sure\nShe also wouldn't say or what she thought about extending the transition period the u._k. would have to leave the EU which is something that some leaders including the Irish prime minister we're talking about\nElaborate on that um and what would that mean to extend the transition period after Britain leaves the you\nWell right now the agreement is more or less that uh when the u._k. leans on twenty ninth of march next year that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other words twenty twenty\nOr economic and trade deals between the u._k. and you would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all of this is the specter of Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out\nYeah and that's something that everyone is is quite worried about um besides the fact you'd have snarled borders and price hikes for good or it it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example or analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard to break that as it were\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while NPR Soraya ...

talk to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of formal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit calling me we'll talk about that is\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves all my medicines and pharmacies\nYup there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you

me why did he have one here that I'm working with with\nThese new officers get five weeks of training but just the four hours rocky teachers on how to deal with women prisoners everyone's\nSaying we're supposed to treat everyone the same for ... why is there you know I work with women across\nThe country some Fifteen states start teaching new ways of treating women prisoners gender response of corrections is built around the understanding that women prisoners are different they're less likely to come to prison for violent crimes in prison are less likely than men to be violent\nBut the discipline system in prison is set up to control violent men so those rules country women more harshly were unfairly\nIt's an insight that came out of decades of academic research from feminist historians sociologist and other academics from women consultants who specializes in prisons and from that minority of women who made a career in corrections like Maggie Burke\nShe was the warden of a women's prison in Illinois but she too started as a corrections officer at a men's prison\nYou do a firearms your very first week of training and then that screens everybody out if you can't pass with a weapon than you can't do the job and and I'm going to tell you that you know twenty nine years in the department and I've never had to use them again\nThe second thing she says corrections officers learn how to use handcuffs\nAnd so that kinda set people up with an expectation that the work we're doing is physical as aggressive as learned orders era military but the work we're doing is talking to people in the changing lives and you don't do that by barking orders you don't do that by forcing people to do something\nAbout Seventy five Ninety percent of women in prison had been victims of sexual or physical violence when a corrections officer especially if it's a man yells or boxing order the woman's reaction is often defensive she might just shut down or she might yell back and that can result in a ticket she gets disciplined\nTypically when you tell them in to do something a male inmates he's either going to do it or is that he's not ... he's not going to talk back there isn't a whole lot of emotion to it\nBroke worked in men's and women's prisons\nWhereas with women emotion is in\nThis sounds like a generalization but we heard it over and over from experts on women's prisons\nAnd she's just like go ahead write me a ticket it just feels a fire and so then it's an emotional ticket\nPrison guards are trained to keep it may under control women in our society in general are expected to be compliant and if they push back which in prison they do more than men officers use that tool they have control they hand out punishment\nNow she's got insolence 'cause she's talking back at me and maybe she said something that I can perceive is threatening and I'm In uh right you know that she threatened me\nNPR and the deal school of journalism at Northwestern university collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states\nWe estimated rates of punishment for men and women and our numbers show that women typically get this one that higher rates for the more minor violations of prison rules\nOften uh twice or three times the rate for men for those smaller things like disobeying a corrections officer or cursing or talking back [laughter] who send the Gillum as a prisoner at the Iowa correctional institution for women serving time for robbery\nShe remembers when not that long ago she get into a lot of trouble for talking back\nOnce a corrections officer made an announcement on the overhead speaker for the women to be quiet but ... says she was on another part of the cell block and didn't hear it\nWhile I was coming from upstairs and I have to end up and I said what was that and he said hey I said no talk and whatever and now it's like well you don't have to yeah and I let him down here and he made a comment on our site well this is America I can say what I Want [laughter] and he wrote me up for it out my response that smart Adel al Awlaki and I got to a major report\nTypically when women prisoners by weight rules even a lesser violation they can lose privileges like getting visits are using the phone they can go to solitary confinement or have days added to their time in prison\nNow the prison in Iowa trains officers that if it's not a security issue that some of those things go de escalate situations that we the tickets\nBecause the officer is the new ones that I notice they they talk to us more they interact with us more to access how they've done not trying to be our friend let realized that where people\nOn that we've made mistakes that get ourselves there you know they they're kinder\nAnd ... says that changing the way corrections officers responded to her health premature\nShe's been taking college classes and once you leave prison next year she wants to complete her degree and get a job counseling people recovering from substance abuse as states start implementing these new ways of treating women there is a small amount of research that shows women like who send the Gillum men do better when they leave prison\nSo are there lessons in this women's reformed to make present work better for men to Becky Nate thanks so women lead the way yes she's a pioneer of gender response of corrections she started the national resource center on justice involved women\nMen probably have trauma in their lives and then probably been victimized in their lives and have lots of discipline issues\nAnd men make up Ninety three percent of people in prison\nSo maybe we will find some opportunities to take the work we know about trauma and get it on the stand and have that be very helpful to him as well\nJust like women's prisons learned from studying what specific about the trauma of women may says men's prisons can learn by studying what specific about the lives of men she says there's already an example\nMore men's prisons are trimming corrections officers how to de escalate conflict to figure out what it is about men that causes them to ACT UP and to use that gender based knowledge to avoid situations that we'd the getting disciplined for violating prison rules Joseph Shapiro\nNPR News [noise] and you can find our entire series on the ways in which women prisoners are disciplines

Fifteen ... airplanes to to carry out airstrikes\nUnited States supplies the weapons the maintenance the training if the U.S threatened in any way to to limit that cooperation that would severely restrict the way that the Saudis could carry out that that war and there'd been high civilian casualties\nAnd that's something the U.S could press the Saudis on if they so chose\nThe other is just boycott of Qatar or Saudi Arabia's neighbor well Qatar's of very wealthy country it's also a close us ally a major us airbase there\nUm and and so that uh is something the U.S could cause stress and say hey play nice with Qatar we want these are all we're both were all in this together um let's let's end that boycott\nOut Saudi Arabia reacting to the possibility of the sanctions would their response likely be\nWell they they came out this week and said that they would respond with greater action if if some sorts of the punitive measures are imposed on them um they could always pump less oil and try to drive up prices although that goes very much against their the way they've always done business\nUm interesting factoid or the Energy Department announced just last month the U.S has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's leading oil producer about eleven million barrels per day\nSo Saturday El Al is just not as important as it is it used to be a but this uh this ... is a reminder that relations are often strain the thing you often hear when talking about the U.S in Saudi Saudi Arabia's these are countries that share that share interests not values\nNPR's Greg Myre we thank you thank you yesterday President Trump compared the ... case to the debate over Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh he said both are cases of quote guilty until proven innocent\nDuring that confirmation debate the Supreme Court justices themselves largely kept quiet now the Kavanaugh is on the court chief justice John Roberts is speaking publicly trying to make sure that the bitter fight doesn't cast a shadow over the high court\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions [noise]\nBut what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be very different\nThe chief justice gave that audience at the University of Minnesota law school a defective civics lesson about the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy our role\nIs very clear we are to enter\nConstitution and laws of the United states\nAnd ensure that the political branches act within them that job obviously requires\nIndependence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence\nRoberts highlighted some of the difficult decisions the court made that ran contrary to popular political opinions of the day and Roberts said when the court has made mistakes it is because the court gave in to political pressure for example the Korematsu ruling that upheld internment of Japanese Americans during World War two\nYou shared a tradition the justices have one that's designed to reinforce their shared commitment to working together despite ideological differences\nBefore we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand it's a small thing perhaps but it is a repeated reminder that as our newest colleagues put it\nWe do not sit on opposite sides of an eye all we do not serve one party or one interest\nWe serve one nation and I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that to the best of our abilities whether times are called or contentious\nJohn Roberts chief justice of the United states speaking yesterday in Minnesota [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThis is Katie big crowds lined up across Canada today for the start of legal marijuana sales U.S officials say the legalization of recreational pot in Canada has not prompted any big changes in the flow of traffic at the U.S Canada border\nBut Canadians who admit they've used ... in the past could be barred from life from the U.S we'll hear more about that next\nK.
