apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bill because they

he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan\nJumpsuit he didn't say much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear

which the analogy does not apply at all in Nazi Germany this was the government doing this\nUh what we're seeing in this country in terms of anti Semitism is may be a willingness some part of ... certain segments of the government and certain people in government\nTo look the other way but this is not government sponsored however there are parallels a the parallels in the attacks on democratic

killed eleven worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday he was arraigned in a courtroom in Pittsburgh earlier today\nJulie ... which has been reporting on his background for the New York times and she joins us now welcome thank you thank you for having me you've been speaking with people who know Robert powers including a childhood friend of his what have you learned from them\nSo most of the people that we've spoken to describe him as very client very isolated lived alone he watched television in the night he used PO box for not the sort of a mail box set his apartment which is just south synagogue [noise]\nBut I spoke to a friend of his has known him for years and years\nThey went to elementary school together they went to middle school together and they went to high school together\nAnd he said that that I'm Robert Bauer as as a child was very smart but also seem to really struggle with social cues and the two of them were friends and the way to play together and they were built things together they would take things apart [noise]\nAh they would build bombs together as sort of pranks in law watermelons but as time went on the two of them sort of grew apart and rubber hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappear and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this and what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a ghost like he's not even there\nYeah I'm so she lived in is sort of low slung apartment building that twenty five minutes south of the synagogue\nAnd the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name [noise]\nThat he was pretty much go she would come and go and sometimes disappear for days come back\nGo inside and that was pretty much it\n[noise] and there was such a contrast between vet demeanor in person\nWho he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year he spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nUsed a lot of really terrible things about Jews about immigrants [noise] he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like minded community on Gabrielle crucial media network that has\nBecome more popular among All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome\nIn places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his\nAnger and he seemed to think that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed Hughes hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\n[noise] I don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think than is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks and the next couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about having his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did she\nBecome as hateful as he did and how long I've been going on and what role did Internet playing did the current for political anger and conflict playing uh so\nI Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going to he's home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as a country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears are you sure Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey they're allowed so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage and the president is negative\nAnd then suddenly I had to a realization and so the first one was it all takes place in the marriage ... office that's what the story is and the second was it's from the marriage counsellors point of view and that was a big step for me for two reasons you know I I've never been a marriage counselor\nAnd number two the marriage counselor had to be a woman why I just that I've asked myself that I mean part of it was that my marriage culture was a woman\nAnd I believe most marriage cancers are women and it just felt right it just felt like it had to be that way how similar is a marriage counselor and spoke to the one that you used [noise]\nSo the marriage counselor in the book is different but the themes of the marriage counts or the technique of the marriage counselor are very much the same way explain what do you mean one of those themes and techniques\nSo for example the marriage counselor says there are no deals you know you can't make any deals with each other we're not going to do exchanges of promises\nWere not going to say okay I'll do this and you'll do that and therefore our marriage is all going to work out there is none of that you know to go to a marriage cancer who says that to you is really an interesting experience\nAnd then the second thing is if you want something from your partner you've got to make them want to give it to you so in the simplest situation if you want your partner to love you then you've got to become to kind of person\nThat your partner's going to want to love ... you know those are the kinds of insight simple but I think critically important insights that\nMy real marriage cancer and my six year old marriage counselor share [noise] would you mind reading a section of the book for me no sure page thirty eight [noise]\nUsually Sandy didn't pay much attention to the world beyond her small office the illicit meeting in New York where Russian was going for the weekend what bill's wife knew everything that happened outside the office she didn't care to Sandy the important story was what happened inside or office\nIt was what she had to focus on it was the story it was what was really happening\nOf course all the time it was tempting to get caught up in the outside story the affairs the sex the trails the soap opera\nBut the real work was here inside or office\nIt almost feels like these a statement for the buck [noise] it is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust of the reader to get it ... you know\nThose two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is\nI Know that is true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs can actually be what's important to whether American lives or dies\n[noise] I have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter [noise]\nAnd and I can tell that by analogy [noise] so what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when you can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's as if you shed everything that happened before\nRight I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt does and it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage it's about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be and that's why it takes time because it's\nIt is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to be a nice fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all it's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't have it together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what the couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leads them through for example throughout the book to show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\n[noise] and as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way\n[noise] I said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself it's the marriage itself\nAnd the marriage scouts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character she's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriage as as something that they built over time that's very important and it's all live in a way this different from each of them\n[noise] marriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties you\nWeren't as clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters well\nI mean you're after they write my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of transnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro and important relationship because it makes your life so much better you know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like\nThe two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together\nDo you think\nEvery marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years [noise] but I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay\nI mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you wanted to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you [noise] well\n... thank you so much for talking with us about your book well thank you so much this was really fun is novel is called listen to the marriage bond\nNah
