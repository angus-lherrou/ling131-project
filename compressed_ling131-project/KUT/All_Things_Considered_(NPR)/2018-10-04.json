thought the earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized\nThat means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor what does rock vapor and and what does that have to do with our moon rock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas and when that occurs the earth becomes much ...\nPerjure because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet

of rice\nThat ship has been found in the type of computer servers used by at least thirty major American companies including apple and major banks also servers used by the Pentagon and the CIA Bloomberg describes this chip as quote\nA stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines and historically Bloomberg reports was built in China\nMichael ... is one of the reporters who broke this story today Welcome thank you very much tell me a little bit more about this microchip and what kind of damage potentially it's capable of doing\nYeah so it's a basically a chip that was built in to a mother board it's made by a U.S company called super micro super micro even though most people have never heard of ... of the company is incredibly important in the business of making servers\nAnd service on the neurons of the cloud of the basically the Internet these big data centers with tens of thousands of service on them and these particular service for being assembled in China the actual mother boards were being built in China\nChina basically makes the vast majority of all technology in the world today it's all been off shored and most of it has gone to China\nAnd governments have long pointed out that this is a risk because if the country allows that spies to mess with that process it's a major threat but companies always assumed that that's too valuable to try to to mess with\nThe what the story tells us is in fact at least when the targets are valuable enough for specific enough they're going to be willing to do that\nTo the critical question of who did this you quote sources you point to a Chinese military unit has her at China denies that they have done this have anything to do with how confident are you based on your reporting that\nWas trying to [noise] well that's certainly what the US government has assessed it to be and they assess it with U.S intelligence U.S intelligence what's right and that's that's a very high confidence\nAnd it's interesting when we asked China's foreign ministry for ... a lot of times they'll say things like you're crazy we nothing nothing about this their response was a little more nuanced and protect social environment we're in now basically said\nWe are a victim of these kinds of attacks to and you know they're right\nGovernment it's very very good at these kinds of hardware attacks and on a subtle way that a message to there was a deliberate was don't the conscious on us if you guys want to talk about very sophisticated hardware tax you have to talk about what you do it while\nYou're citing sources and U.S intelligence and I want to push you on this because some of the company's caught up in your reporting which include Amazon which include apple which include super microbes they dispute summaries of your reporting you've got their full statements on your Web site that's right\nThey say they don't respond they basically said nothing like this ever happened when you give me a sense of how many officials you talked to who are in forming your reporting I'll give you some\nSense of the cluster of ah sources 'cause that's really important so we had\nSeveral sources inside of the U.S intelligence community we had several sources inside law enforced and we had sources inside the the other parts of the U.S government but we also more importantly had sources inside the companies who whether these ships were found the interesting thing about apple and Amazon is they\nAre two very big very valuable companies but they also have pretty good security the fact that they found these chips was amazing in itself\nNow companies wouldn't be responsible for saying what they what they want to say but based on our sourcing and the way it was layer for so many different places including inside of the companies were really confident that we had a story down so what are the implications of this well they're more\nThey're they're they're really very large economic and national security\nThat's right in part because the global economy is built on sort of global outsourcing trade model\nAnd again especially where it comes to technology China is a huge player and that and the implications of this are companies now have to think well do I have to worry about what's being put in the technology that's being manufactured how do I try and counter that is it should I go someplace else and make things I mean it's a it's a really big hard issue to solve\nA for a lot of companies a lot of companies the reason they operate and as cheaply and can sell products that she plays that count as because many of those crossing products are made in China they have to rethink the entire model you could have sort of a tidal wave of decisions that could impact the the global

with the company maintaining a portable toilet downtown some bristled at the cost a hundred and fifty five thousand dollars a year over five years\nCity staff point out that the toilet facility if the

it's taking so long to install less costly to operate permanent facilities\nWe had all these years of discussion really talking about buying a pre made model that can easily be solved and that has to die for an urban environment\nAnd in ways that discouraged other kinds of activity within them\nWe will not be constructing will be cheering but we need to have the design a specification criteria this is Katie\nAnd going in and out of a secure underground room at the Capitol viewing one copy of the FBI's report on sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh all\nThe reporters confidential and reactions have been divided Democrats called incomplete Republicans say it was Thoreau a final vote on Kavanaugh could take place within forty eight hours and there are just a few undecided senators for more on that we are joined by NPR's\nKelsey Snell Hi Kelsey there as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us later in the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabin on he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him feel stronger about that support here's what he said and I\nThink after all this is a stronger in terms of understanding the facts and are looking for and I am ready to vote\nBut what about those three undecided senators we've been talking about all week what have you heard from them\nYeah we're focused still on Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona those three Republicans are really critical here Murkowski has mostly been ducking reporters and she's gone in and out reading that report for much of the day others like Susan Collins of Maine and flake\nThey say they haven't said exactly how their vote but they both say they found this report helpful\nCollins called a thorough and flake who is one of the people who actually called for this investigation he told reporters he thought it was Thoreau as well and he says he hasn't seen any new corroborating evidence which is the thing that he said before he Libya yes if that was the case if there wasn't that corroborating evidence that would be found\nSo we're still kind of reading the tea leaves on how they're going to vote what about the contents of this report how much we learned about what's in it\nHonestly virtually nothing because they can't tell us anything it is confidential it is locked behind those closed doors in some basement has the capital\nAnd we but we do know is that it's about forty five pages and they spoke to about nine people and NPR has confirmed the names of six of them and most of those people are friends of cabin on forward from high school they also spoke with Deborah Ramirez who was a classmate at Yale\nAnd she's the one who she is cabinet of drunk and lay exposing himself to her in the early to mid eighties\nSo like I said there's that one copy and the senators are just circulating through and telling us that you know that these are mostly interviews and I'm a transcription of of the conversations that they had we also know that Ford and Kavanaugh were not interviewed so they are not a part of this and denser pretty upset about that [noise]\nSo senators now have the report the Senate majority leader has said he wants to vote in the next forty eight hours what happens in that time\nUh sometime likely tomorrow morning there will be a procedural vote that is necessary for them to move on\nThey need fifty one votes to pass that and that makes this really key test because fifty one of those does all it takes to approve his confirmation when that comes up so if they can get to the fifty one votes now it's very likely they'll be able to get to it wants to the final vote comes up\nAnd you know it it it well it is procedural it's really extremely rare for people to change their minds after procedurals out like this\nAnd you know just as a reminder there are fifty one votes Republicans have that right now and they can afford to lose one person and still approve Kavanaugh because president Mike Pence could step in and cast that tie breaker men a final they'll comes about thirty hours later that means some time maybe Saturday afternoon or early evening for a final though\nKelsey we reflect on the political consequences of this controversy were about a month out from the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats in great they're fighting a battleground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this and energize them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if Kavanaugh gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much\nInk you well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nWould Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... to ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nThey're getting support from strangers even in the elevator\nAlaska Senator half that will really yeah my family [laughter] they call their state's\nSenior senator just Lisa off for no hurt even ... who's twenty seven and by far the youngest she says Murkowski seems receptive to her constituents\nBut he said at a table with her you know you know she is very important person that she felt like look in the eye and is very warm and my experience I've had other\nGroups are also sending Alaskans to meet with mccaskey Molly Hague helped organized Capitol Hill visits for sexual assault survivors on behalf of the Alaska grassroots alliance she says mark ... willingness to listen is the reason so many want to make their case to her\nI think that Senator Murkowski throughout the year and a lot of it and we're really hopeful we're hopeful that we can love her to the right side of the limiting factors now\nOr the senators appointment schedule and airline seats there's only so many flights out of Alaska for the Senate final vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation for NPR News I'm Lance raskin\nWalk into the national portrait gallery in here in Washington right now and you will find a painting that has been ripped to shreds and those shreds nailed to the gallery wall\nAnother one nearby hangs half loose from it stretch church rumpled it's a portrait of Thomas Jefferson and behind to glimpse a seated black woman\nThe piece is called behind some mess of benevolence of these are works by the artist Titus can far he takes ... images and re makes them maybe pulls a hidden figures to the front\nAs of today ... work has been recognized with a MacArthur Award these are the so called genius grants and Titus ... joins us from New Haven Connecticut\nFirst of all welcome and second of all congratulations thank you so much I I Want to ask what was going through your head what was your honest reaction when the phone rang and you've got this call\n[laughter] the matter is I Do not believe the person on the other end fact said to stop it who is is ah but no they reassured me that in fact there was real I Wonder what\nPeople here a little bit more about your work for people who aren't familiar with it so start with that courtroom of Thomas Jefferson that I described talked to me about what you're trying to do here so\nI had a conversation with a um American history teacher\nAnd somehow within that conversation there was this phrase that she authored\nYes but Thomas Jefferson was a benevolent slave owner\nAnd I I was sort of shocked by that I didn't really understand what she meant and I asked her to elaborate on it but she couldn't she didn't and we sort of sat there silos for a little bit I went back to the studio and this was the painting that I made\nAnd so that particular piece is kind of\nPulling back the curtain on these ideas these illusions these stories that we tell ourselves about the founding fun to do that you're literally pulling pulling the canvas of the traditional portrait down that's right that's right and that really has to do with trying to for myself\nFind a way in to these concepts that physically I'm\nSo if you were asking yourself a question about what is it how do you make a painting about torture then you change that and that she was so the question what does it mean to torture paying thing rather than making paintings about something you make paintings that reflect that thing it it sounds like if I'm hearing you write your big point isn't\nWe forget the past we are going to erase it it's we have to shift our gays\nAnd confronted why did well I mean why does it matter to frame it in quite that way\nI don't think that pretending like it didn't happen is beneficial I think it's in fact damaging\nI think if we are not honest about our past than we cannot have a clear direction towards our future\nAnd so you know we're having a sort of a national conversation right now about public monuments and in this discussion we are talking about a we have to sort of binary conversation about keeping these sculptures up or taking them down\nAnd I I actually think that that binary conversations problematic I think there's another possibility and I think that possibility has to do with bringing in a new work that speaks in conversation with this all work it's about a willingness to confront I'm a very difficult past\nSo practically speaking you know apply that to all the rubber daily and all that but Jeffrey Davis statues that are all over the south is what you're saying\nThey can stay there but let's build something ... alongside them that makes you think about this man this history in a different way\nLet me be absolutely clear if we're continuing that binary conversation where we are saying either keep it up or take down ticket do I don't feel in love with the sculpture that's not what this was about\nUh what I'm saying is the binary conversation doesn't bring all of the issues into consideration so there's a third option the third option is we engage our contemporary artists of this time\nAnd the same way that the W O P H did we bring in contemporary artists we have the mix cultures that exist in the communities that they live in we present those sculptures and the same community squares where these Robert easily sculptures exists we pull those ... sculptures\nDown from the pedestal brings them at the same level as these new contemporary works and we force these works to engage one another I think one of our challenges is that we we sort of consistently try to make public sculpture in a way that it's a sentence with the period at the end\nAnd inevitably it's not it's a comma and there should be a clause after that\nRather than thinking of these things as the sort of like\nOn shifting concrete blocks that our fingers touch gentle words finished sentence yeah Titus Kfar\nArtist sculptor and now MacArthur genius award winner thank you so much back you\nA lot [noise]\nYou're listening
