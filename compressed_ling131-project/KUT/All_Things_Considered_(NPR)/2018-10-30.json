begrudge the president has visited all and I've been gratified by the comments he's made and pronouncements that have come out of\nThe White House in recent days against anti Semitism but I'm troubled by the president's ah unwillingness or perhaps his inability to actually recognize the power of words and the responsibility has for the rhetoric\nThat he puts into the public dialogue and in the

shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has focused attention on the rise in anti Semitic attacks an anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd to talk more about anti Semitism and white nationalism we reached out to a lineup Kaufman she works on racial justice issues in the Jewish community welcome\nThank you it's great to be here and we'll start with a very basic question but it's a question that still confound me why are Jews such a focus for white nationalist [noise] you know for white nationalist\nTheirs is deep deep commitment to maintaining political historical um an institutional supremacy in the United states um and around the world in terms of you know global white nationalism there is a perspective that a certain kind of lightness is superior\nA real intention to maintain that kind of superiority both on on the inter personal level in terms of attitudes or behaviors and beliefs and how the transfer between people\nBut also an institutional on a national level who are politics I'm to the way that we talk about documentary history authored a way that we manage our institutions and it's um an effort to maintain power and to keep people who are different um marginalized 'em and separated in in our communities\nYou mentioned in a certain kind of white ness in much of the American Jewish community is of European descent and identify as being white but you're kind of thing that makes no difference to white nationalist why do you think that uh eighty\nTo Ninety percent of Jewish Americans are are white or come from a white background\nTo white nationalism you know are Jewish community here in the United states largely comes from immigrant backgrounds or comes from background how strong ethnic\nIdentity when we came to this country and ah we were among the whole group of people from different countries who were other because of our our our national origin and just certain kinds of white and it's we're both elevated and celebrating in this country as far as history goes back\nWe should mention that you are Jewish but you're also black that for white nationalist hatred of ... different from racism against blacks Latinos and other minorities that they see a threat\n[noise] people of color are visibly different and because of that we've been an easy group to target and we've been an easy group to keep separate from those who have more skinned privilege because her skin presents later or wider and then in contrast we\nThink about the hatred and Jews and if we assume that most user white in this country than we have to find another way\nTo separate Jews out and so this has particular brand of white nationalism in the United states as a particular kind of Christian white nationalism is designed to take away from this idea that we are stronger because of our diversity and to scare people into thinking we are stronger because of our individual identity\nSo do you see something new about the anti Semitism we see in the U.S today I'm anti Semitism has persisted for centuries but if there's something different about it now\nWhat's different about this time is that we have people in power who are using their institutional position that had traditionally been is designed to bring us together as a country to separate us in the country through anti Semitic you think that's in you know\nI think when we have our policymakers amplifying ideas as a real amplifying stereotypes as fact\nAnd using fear to marginalize Jewish people in a way to elevate the fear mongers it is different\nAnd the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified\nSaid what new strategies can we or the Jewish community in particular employ to combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our streets that we know each one of us is going to come out of our houses to support the other that we will not last June who needs who need just kind of advocacy but it becomes part of

is about and being older and having gone through the loss of my mother and my grandma I feel closer to my my people and to my legacy of family when I sing that song\nCurrently and remember singing will the circle being broken with our kids at the gravesite service for her mother June that connection to lineage has touched those outside the Carter bloodline too\nEarly Nineteen seventies the song gave the California country rockers in the nitty gritty dirt band a way to bond with their country and bluegrass idle says Jeff Hannah what are the bans founding member\nWas as much about just getting

one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third was the explosives sent through the mail to prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here on the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Hi Greg hey are we hear so much about international terrorism and efforts to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe death toll passed Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target a small minorities in smaller numbers than him indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that this is the new face of extremism\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks really started picking up about a decade ago of the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media\nThe Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments and the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nUh always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thought that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they study terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk\nWhat are the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to buy when we find that the believing in this collective center victim is in your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level of course for re the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism and he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that\nBut he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here I'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail but\nThere are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell a who will act in who's just ranting we're\nGoing to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these ... but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attack\nThat type of your national security correspondent Greg Myre thanks ... thanks sorry\nBefore Robert Bowers walked into the tree of life synagogue in

ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present to clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nIn the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew tour by the c._e._o. of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nSo more than a book shall we like to say\nTo afford its own space the collective asked for donations and loans they got what they needed and\nMore after securing enough funds to mind

literary chain the whole process collectively took about an hour\nIt was really sort of surprising and positive and just really moving experience to see people chipping in\nBecause they wanted to help
