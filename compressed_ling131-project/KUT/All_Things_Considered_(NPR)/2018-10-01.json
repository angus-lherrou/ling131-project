Ninety One festival with the husband Brendan when the gunman opened fire she told me what happened\nWell written anyone the concert itself is pretty special to me and my friends and family in two thousand Seventeen last year we were staying at Mandalay Bay\nFor some reason on a Sunday night everyone was like a little antsy about separating so we all decided we're just going to stay together I mentioned go not up closer and everyone said why don't we just stay back here tonight\nThat was just a little bit now looking back a strange coincidence and probably what might have saved our lives you it sounds team was one of the people were really looking forward to seeing carrying and hearing tempting and um\nHe was on one of mine and my husband's favorite songs sell a pitch that we're standing right next to each other when he was singing and the old our store you know at the end of the song my husband\nOr the police started to say are those and an expert out is not going to be ... but he didn't really advocate those without his mouth because at that point\nWe saw kind of a wave of people coming towards us so she got me and we started running and then I started running that's an automatic sounding gunfire started where it was just um you can denied that it was shot Seymour\nThankfully we were really close to an exit\nAnd were able to read and tell where it was coming from not at all it was a it was so loud it just didn't seem like I couldn't even bat an network ended up coming from that was from that because it was just you know so it seems so in your face I mean we could hear at the actual with the noise of the bullets going by us by our ears their heads as are running\nThe parking lot right across the street from where we got out and we just ended up diving behind him so car we'll some tires and trying to just stay there it just seemed like it got louder and closer and it never stop we could get a break and go okay\nIt's fine it's okay you know everything's okay and then it would start up again and I remember at one point I just looked to my husband and said is ever going to end and it didn't seem like it was going to end\nDid you find that if you see people get hits\nI didn't focus on any of that that was ... I I I didn't personally see anyone um down like from the gotten shot right there we stop people injured along the way and bloodied but thankfully I was having to\nSee that if you ever had their standing next to people that just dropped the ground and they were thinking gosh that person's really drunk and then ended up looking like they're flashlight and their son had some of our fence I some really hard to stay around um details yeah\nUm are you a behind a call ...\n... at that point we thought we should go try to head back towards the Mandalay Bay 'cause that's where I'm staying little we know that was a horrific yet because that's where the gunshots coming from and at one point I remember whether I thought we were I wanted to stop and hide and he looked up and notice that we are standing right in front of you jet fuel tanks\nAnd he said at that moment um we had to get away from the is because these get shot at just over the it's going to blow up\nAnd then the ironic thing of all that was the shooter did in deep shit those um those fuel tanks and thankfully they didn't ignite and that's another thing that I just think like what if what if that would have happened 'cause that would have been all\nHow you could have been standing at the front you could have stayed behind these gas tanks which what you're telling the story now and you're sounding incredibly\nCalm but you must have had plenty of time to reflect on on the fight lock and that will probably\nRight now I'm struggling a year later with more than\nOther emotions and um you know even to the point with the like hearing the bullet whizzing by like if we would have taken a step to the right straight not bullet whizzing by our head or to the left dirt on been standing you know\nTwo feet close or what would have happened and why were we spared and other people were because it was just too many weird coincidences it may may be saved our lives but it didn't have those people live so\nThat's a little bit of a struggle a year later that I'm having more than I was initially right afterwards because I just feel like we had a lot of chance things happens at what against ah the normal odd that we you know that normal things that that weekend I'm\nHow have you tried to coax since it happened\nOf the main things that really helped me was our city got an a hockey team this past year or the first year and\nA team did an amazing they made it all the way that the Stanley Cup and they really you know the city and in a way which is that they know very strange but they just really made I said he be able to focus on something positive and they face that situation and they always that up for\nUm for the city and for what we went through and always honored survivors and that people that the victims of the shootings that that was also strangely healing channel\nAnd of course one of the reasons that so many people died was because the ... the shoe to\nUsed bump stocks these devices which essentially tuna a semi automatic rifle into into a machine gun into a fully automatic rifle I just want to play something today because President Trump was asked about the ... the plan to to ban bump stocks at a at a news conference that someone listen to what do you have to say\nSo in order to eliminate terminate bumps us we have to go through a procedure or we are now at the final stages of that proceed in fact the lawyers were just telling me and over the next couple of weeks I'll be able to read that but you can't just write it up because\nRules and regulations in this country a really tough even for something like that so we're knocking out bumps I've told the n._r._a. up do the bump stocks and gun but it's a process that takes statute orally it takes about a year to do with\nPresident Trump saying it takes a long time when you hear and what do you think\n[laughter] um yes I get that's how things work but um it seems like when lives are lost it there there may be more action that they I mean even executive action that can be taken against things like that the ... like I mean I'm Glad that I think it's ridiculous that um that was even something that's legal error that\nWasn't not a lot before so I guess to me I should be a little bit more like happy about that but I'm near a little bit of a band aid I'm a ... year old place and then my life you know I I'd be happy if I Lived in a place like Australia where guns are not allowed but I understand I made that choice to live in a Mac I Love America\nAnd I understand that we have a constitution I don't understand how they like

at politifact and a former NPR reporter welcome good to be with you start with a statement cabin on made about what other people at the gathering Christine lousy for describes from thirty six years ago what those people say they remember take a listen\nDr Ford's allegation is not merely uncorroborated it is refuted by the very people she says we're there including by a longtime friend of hers refuted\nRefuted Kavanaugh saying those people have received data for its recollection of what happened is that accurate\nNot quite accurate because the bulk of their statements are that they don't remember now the letters vary in terms of how fat ugly they don't remember how fat ugly they deny\nWhat they think what's happening in that summer but there is a big difference between not remembering refuting and that's why having\nThe FBI investigators get involved might help the senators drill down on this\nOkay let's turn to another statement this one where Kavanaugh has been asked about drinking while he was under age\nThe drinking age was Eighteen and Marilyn's for most of my time and high school and was Eighteen in DC for all my time in high school\nAll right John did Kevin don't get the law right was Eighteen the drinking age at the time in both places\nBrett Kavanaugh got it wrong from Maryland in Maryland the drinking age in the summer of Nineteen eighty two went from Eighteen to Twenty one\nSo at the time it would be very likely that Brett Kavanaugh being someone who was a less than Twenty one was not drinking legally at least for half of the summer\nThere are also moments where Kavanaugh talks about how much he drank back then he repeatedly mentioned that he liked to be here but he said as much as he liked to hear his drinking was not out of control here's how he put it\nI liked beer I still like beer but I did not drink beer to the point walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nHow firmly can have a nine Sistine never drank to the point of blacking out has there been any evidence to challenge that\nFar we've heard from people who went to high school with him college with him who said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk\nBut how is anyone to sort this out\nI think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective it's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was\nTo the wrong ER and there's an official record of that this is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now three days and to the pro NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either\nLet's start with the big sticking points so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nDo we don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat said the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly\nUh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation that said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into well they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a\nOn this question of senior U.S Senate GPA pointed to comments at SUNY Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend a Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kevin us friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations said back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSort of have mentioned this is day three of the FBI is a week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing in those three days so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any ah any clarity on this but NPR has learned up the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident\nUh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much cricket side of the bureau has not reached out before it at this point it also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat neck\nA and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question one of course it's Kavanaugh's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more if Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently well\nThe last twenty four hours a former friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nOr but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kavanaugh did not behave that way they don't match a those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kavanaugh's truthfulness about his drinking is ruthless in his testimony\nThat it's a something that should be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had to say [noise] NPR's Ryan Lucas thanks try and get [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThis is Katie still to come a former FBI agent talks

FBI is three days into its week long investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to understand what a supplemental probe up this type might entail we reached out to Jack ... he's\nA former FBI agent he's conducted plenty of background probes into federal judges and he walked me through how he would go about this when if he were on the team investigating Kevin\nFirst I Would spend a lot of time trying to locate the home\nPerhaps Dr Ford to ride around with agents we don't have much time you know we have to do it quickly if we can limit the neighborhood where the general area and you might be able to find the house are also real estate records available that you have to be I Would investigate\n... let me just start with the first example you would actually have Christine Blasey Ford in a card with you and just drive around the neighborhood and see if that John's her memory to point out to have a right absolutely would awesome and you would try to look for what you said floor plans of has is in the neighborhood yeah matched the description from her memory\nI Would and her memory is there's a living room right inside the front door ... their way up to a bedroom on one side and the bathroom across the hallway we're looking for that\n[noise] what else would you do judge Kavanaugh offered them written calendars from his high school years what would you do with those calendars\nOh an interview everyone on the calendar and the crucial time period is summer middle of the summer or so July Nineteen eighty two\nAnd what else what else do you think is manageable to do within one week\nLove to do it quickly to do a polygraph of all three people involved and the alleged sexual assault judge Kavanaugh mark judge and the doctor for you good polygraph all three of them\n... high there are allegations that involve Kavanaugh's behavior well under the influence of alcohol on during his younger years is it relevant would it be relevant to you if you are on this investigation to do a thorough job of his drinking habits in high school and in college\n[noise] yes else in this instance not in all I Would want to interview him extensively about his drinking habits high school college and law school I Would want that on the interview\nDo you think the FBI in one week can turn of information that has not already been turned up by Senate staffers who have said a background investigation cannot wet tell me why do\nI Do because of the training the FBI yeah it's\nReally a while the staffers are good people and they work hard at backgrounds the FBI does this as its mandate we do it all over the country frequently and the agents assigned this case agents and backgrounds are well trained done it many times\nAnd it turns out the FBI finds information that raises questions about the fitness of Brett Kavanaugh to serve on a Supreme Court definitely happy I have a responsibility to pursue those additional leap\nYes I Would pursue them if I were the case I definitely would of course with this week's deadline and unlimited scope recording to President Trump I don't know whether we would be permitted to go forth ... additional interviews\nDo you think the FBI has a responsibility to ask for additional time if additional information comes up about issues that weren't at the forefront at the beginning\nI think the FBI good requested additional time if they're found new evidence new information about why the background is being inducted I think the FBI could requested however President Trump must approve the quest\nJak Owens is a former FBI agent thank you very much\nOh You're welcome Elsa thank you\nEven as the fight over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues the court began a new term today and it did so it was only eight justices\nHad hoped to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg without the court today and has this report\nDid they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government at the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deal\nInevitably he faced Kevin questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court the president never really answered the question\nWas you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly\nMeanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation that was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kevin unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBiggest biometric data base called ...

I don't mind and investigation as long as the investigation is it fair that it's timely that it's not just designed to be able to drag on a week and at the end of it say well now we need another week and now in another week the Anita Hill investigation that with the FBI that time was three days\nIf the investigation is and be confined to one week uh your colleague in Tyler Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona has said that if the FBI investigation finds that Kavanaugh lied under oath during his hearings than his nomination of dead you agree with flight\nWould absolutely agree and then then the issues to fall as not only sexual assault as an issue but it's lying to Congress in lying under oath or clearly that would be disqualified\nEven if it's found that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking habits do you think that would be disqualifying as\nWell so that has been a whole new issue that I've been fascinated with that people have said OK if we can now now that we have him on a record for new things let's try to find new things that maybe we we can say not necessarily lying about what we have different interpretations\nOf one people that one person says yes objectively I think you drink too much and he says objectively\nThough I don't think I was drinking too much then that's enough for lying and enough to exclude him that's no longer a dialogue about sexual assault that's trying to find some way to trip up a nominee\nTo able to catch them on something based on some kind of history from thirty six years ago that ... that's no longer really drawn to be able to get to a judge that's trying to destroy someone personally I I Am offended by that and I think most people should be\nQuite frankly many of my democratic colleagues\nHave started to make quietly I really hope that they don't reopen my time when I was in high school the way that we're opening up the time on Brett Kavanaugh and he's in high school and try to challenge every day\nYou don't think it's fair to say that it would be disqualifying Brett Kavanaugh was nice characterizing his drinking habits as a teenager\nSo drinking habits as a teenager and someone saying he drank too much and the other one saying you didn't drink too much becomes subjective issue a sexual assault is very clear\nRepublican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma thank you very much for joining us today by glad to be able to share with you\nGeneral Electric stunned much of Wall Street today by firing its chief executive John ... after about a year ... stock price and reputation had settled declined over the years they fell further under flattery is watch NPR's Jim Zarroli reports\nFew companies have the kind of storied history that he had\nWe bring good things to it was one of the ...\nOriginal companies and the Dow Jones industrial average it made jet engines dishwashers light bulbs nuclear reactors it's management techniques were studied in business schools she was an incubator for CEOs top executives who went on to had other fortune five hundred companies\nBut University of Michigan business professor Erik Gordon says there were problems onto the surface it\nBecame a big bureaucracy ah and it moved slowly in a world that kept moving more quickly\nGordon says much of GE he's profits turned out to be tied to its financial services arm which was badly hurt and the crash of the housing market in the years that followed GE he started to shrink by laying off a lot of employees and selling divisions but it wasn't enough\nThat was the company that John slant already inherited when he became CEO and August of last year plan or we spent months trying to convince GE shareholders that he was addressing the company's problems here he was over the summer in an interview on CNBC\nWe've covered the company from Horner to corner terms that analyzes all aspects of the company insurance capital power business so I'm very comfortable we've got a handle on what's going on inside the company\nBut the problems only seem to mount especially if the troubled G.

rules to figure out in every city and it just adds to the cost of development which is part of the problem\n... says even just a little uncertainty threatens funding for a project because developers

poor have steadily declined since the Nineteen eighties\nBlum says rent control is just a band aid and at the root of the problem is the fact that there's just not enough housing\nThe real solution to our affordable housing crisis is more construction of housing\nThe whole spectrum\nThe state estimates it needs to build well over a million new units right now land is in short supply and a lot of

developments in human history\nChina's government has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over near forty years\nThere's never been anything like it and China's new wealth and power are changing the world this week we're starting a series that explores China's reach into other countries NPR's chief international editor will Dotson joins us now to give us a preview hey well I also\nSo I understand the series is looking at China but from the vantage point of other countries why look at China can be out side\n[noise] right well for nearly Thirty years we've been reporting on a rising China we've been following as it reaches one atomic benchmark after another\nAt some point you have to recognize that the world is changed and\nChina's not rising anymore it's risen right what we're looking at now is not a developing country it's a major player throws its weight around that is confident and assertive in sort of pushing its its interests and if you want to see that engagement you have to be looking outside of China and how did you decide\nWhere to go to assess China's massive influence around the world well\nWe went to more than a dozen countries around the globe we went to South America Africa Europe south east Asia\nAnd what we were looking to do is not just to sort of achieve a a geographic diversity we're looking at a diversity of places in terms of the countries that China is meeting so that means how China engages democracies versus how it's engaging developing economies\nStruggling societies places\nThat are very far afield generally far out of their orbits and places that are in their strategic backyard\nAnd without telling us too much about the slaves were even here in the next ... days give us hand if you found\nWell it'd be great to start with a story that our Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz fouled up he was looking at China as meddling in Australia meddling yeah look of course China in Australia have a really broad relationship or they are huge trading partners\nBut the relationship is deeper than just goods and services he looks at a writer who was trying to write a book critical of China's influence in Australia and for the longest time he couldn't get it published in Australia\nAnd and this is sort of thing that's really remarkable here is that China's no longer content to stifle free speech just within its own borders it's now extending its influence into the public sphere of other countries exercising censorship in foreign country exactly where else did you guys go\nWell in Africa are Nairobi correspondent found a massive new infrastructure projects that links to of Kenya's largest cities\nNow this is something you can find many places like this it's something that can you deeply needs it's a it's been very well done and very well executed but it's now leading to greater local resentment and the Chinese operation using Chinese labor and there's fear understandable fear in Kenya that they won't be able to pay the Chinese back\nThat these Chinese projects that we're seeing spring up around the world are creating debt traps that could cause future dependency\nIt's also important that China doesn't always get its way in some places they're making massive investments are in these projects are hitting the skids and we have a story that look some of the problems that can be devil even China or in Morocco\nAnd then in Europe there are concerns about China's stifling free speech fear over investment in certain high tech sectors and also there's growing concern about China investing huge amounts and ports around the continent here's one analyst explaining what's worrying some in Europe\nThey've invested all along the periphery of Europe it's like almost an anaconda strategy like you surround it didn't sleep and that way you have some control and lovers\nWhat an ominous analogy in anaconda had exactly the anaconda strategy and how China chooses to use

gathering Christine Blasey Ford describes from thirty six years ago what those people say they remember take a listen\nDr Ford's allegation is not merely uncorroborated it is refuted by the very people she says we're there including by a longtime friend of hers refuted\nRefuted cabin I think those people hadn't refudiate it for its recollection of what happened is that ...\nNot quite accurate because the bulk of their statements are that they don't remember now the letters vary in terms of how in fat ugly they don't remember how fat ugly they deny what they think was happening in that summer\nBut there is a big difference between not remembering and refuting and that's why having\nFBI investigators get involved might help the senators drill down on this\nOkay let's go to another statement this one where Kevin I had been asked about drinking while he was under age\nThe drinking age was Eighteen and Marilyn's for most of my time in high school and was Eighteen in DC for all my time in high school\nAll right John did Kevin and get the law right was Eighteen the drinking age at the time in both places\nBrett Kavanaugh got it wrong from Maryland in Maryland the drinking age in the summer of Nineteen eighty two went from Eighteen to Twenty one\nSo at the time he would be very likely that Brett Kavanaugh being someone who was a less than Twenty one was not drinking legally Italy's for half of the summer\nThere are some moments where Kavanaugh talks about how much he drank back then he repeatedly mentioned that he liked to be here but he says as much as he liked here he's drinking was not out of control here's how he put it\nI liked fear I still like beer but I'm not drink beer to the point of walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nHow firmly contaminants this team never drink to the point of blacking out has there been any evidence to challenge that so far\nWe've heard from people who went to high school with him college with him who said that yeah he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk but how is anyone to sort this out\nI think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective it's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was\nTaken to the wrong ER and there's an official record of that\nThis is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now for three days and to the pro\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either let's start with the big sticking points so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they said that the administration has put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this uh they said that uh they do want a full investigation they've made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive ... investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation that said Trump said today that well he has final say\nHe's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct\nThat was always vague enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope where it's almost inevitable a on this question of senior U.S Senate GPA pointed to comments at SUNY Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week that includes Kevin us friend mark judge a gram also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations they'd back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties and those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's weeklong investigate\n... do you know much about what the FBI has been doing about three days so far well\nThe euro itself has not provided any uh any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez ah she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witness the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much cricket side of the bureau has not reached out to forward at this point\nAlso had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat neck\nA and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question when of course it's Kavanaugh's friend mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI of his his lawyer today declined to say anything beyond that\nAnd at the same time more of Kavanaugh's high school and college acquaintances are speaking out tell us about what they've said most recently\nWell the last twenty four hours a former friend up Kavanaugh's at Yale came out and publicly ... disputed Kevin O's representation of his of his drinking as a young man uh this is Chad letting too and he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kavanaugh drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kavanaugh was belligerent and aggressive drunk\nUm but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin most truthfulness about his drinking his truthfulness in his testimony\nThat it's a something that should be looked into when the president says you know what I Believe what Kevin has had the same NPR's Ryan Lucas thanks trying to give [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News this is Katie I'm
