will bring you that story in a moment but we're supposed to a main story and Mike Pompeo us secretary of state's accusing him run of abusing the international court of justice and using it for political and\nCivil payers criticism came after the ice EJ ordered the U.S to ensure that sanctions against Iran didn't defect humanitarian aid\nMr Pompeo said the U.S would terminate to Nineteen fifty five treaty between the two countries which Iran used as the basis for each case\nThe Iranian foreign minister said the decision vindicated the Islamic republic Republic of Iran and consume the illegitimacy and depressive illness of us sanctions\nBrian Hook is the U.S special representative for Iran at the state department in Washington I asked him why the Trump Administration pulled out of the nuclear agreement that all the other signatories including the European Union said was working\nWell just correct you on one thing I Know one sign the Iran nuclear deal there aren't any signatures to the deal as foreign ministers are re set in a meeting that I attended a year ago it's not an agreement it's simply a plan of action\nAnd so the Iranian regime made a twenty year plan with a president who had two years left in office\nIt is not a legally binding agreement it is not a treaty it is a personal agreement with the president who is no longer in office we certainly made every effort we could to address the deficiencies\nOf the deal in our diplomacy or with the with the British the French and the Germans we weren't able to do that so we have left the deal\n[noise] couldn't do use the existing deal as a confidence building measure to put pressure on Iran on other issues\n[noise] unfortunately the Iran deal are allowed to run to essentially comply with the deal and it gave them a free hand to expand\nA their activities and every other category of threat to peace and security this includes ballistic missile proliferation terrorism cyber activity maritime aggression a big violations of human rights\nThey've been able to do this because the Iran nuclear deal created a climate that really gave people the false sense of impression this the false impression that by complying with the deal they we're complying with all of their other international obligations as a un member states\nAnd so now that we're out of the deal that gives us a lot of freedom to actually go after the range of threats that Iran presents to peace and security\nWe've seen this opinion of the temperature and the route between Washington and Tehran today that President Trump has repeatedly said he's willing to meet the Iranian President whom he recently referred to as a lovely man in the past he said he would meet the Iranians anytime without any condition what happened so you making to make sure that happens\n[noise] we have a made clear to the Iranian regime and to the Iranian people that we seek an entirely different agreement then the Iran nuclear deal\nOr we would like to put in place a an agreement that that really addresses the range of of Iran's threats and then there's a lot that we can offer\nWe would restore diplomatic relations commercial relations welcome Iran back into the international community integrate them into the global economy but they first have to stop destabilizing so many nations around the middle east and beyond this is a revolutionary regime\nWhich exports this I ideology and that generates sectarian violence in the middle east so we would like to get into a new place with them the Ayatollah Khamenei has said publicly that we require hostility with the United states\nThe United states has said that we are very glad to sit down and start talking about a new agreement but that has not been met or in any reciprocal way by the Iranian regime\nAnd briefly what makes you think the more pressure will bring the Iranians back to the negotiating table at an end to see with the U.S in ... from the Iranian population seems to strengthen the result in ... doesn't it\nNo that's not the case uh the only reason that the prior administration was able to get a nuclear deal with Iran is because the pressure that was built multi laterally and largely by us unilateral sanctions between two thousand and six and two thousand and Thirteen\nAny nation that has negotiated with the Iranian regime over the last thirty nine years knows that they do not come to the table without pressure\nBrian Hook the U.S special representative for Iran that the state department speaking to us from Washington\nRescue teams are still trying to

Donald Trump has described himself for decades as a self made billionaire claiming to be built is fourteen and using a one time loan from his father\nMy father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nThat identity as a self made success was central to Trump's presidential campaign now a major investigation by the New York times demonstrates the ways in which that story is false the reporter show that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years starting as a toddler\nAnd the story reveal schemes that Trump family used to avoid gift and the state taxes schemes that stretch and possibly break tax laws rest Buettner is one of the reporters who wrote this story welcome to all things considered thanks sorry\nHow did Donald Trump requires so much wealth from his father over the decades\nIt's a complex story we found two hundred Ninety five unique streams of revenue that Fred Trump set up over the years to funnel money to his children especially to Donald Trump who was always sort of his favorite child\nI Want to get into a couple of those streams in detail but first just to talk about where the story comes from you write that you had more than a hundred thousand pages of documents as well as interviews what kinds of documents are we talking about here\nBy the time we were all done we had more than two hundred tax returns that related both to Fred Trump personally and to his various business entities rehab general ledgers bank account statements property records and some court records that were helpful to time the pieces together\nOkay sort of dig a little bit more deeply into this reporting you've got about ten blockbuster stories in this one sprawling article and I'd like you to tell me about one of them you're right about a company the Trump family created called all county building supply and maintenance and in theory this\nWas a company to purchase and installed refrigerators and other appliances improper to use the Trump owns in practice it allowed for Trump to transfer huge amounts of money tax free to his kids how did this work all\nCounty looks like a company you know when you hear the name but it actually had no existence in the world other than on paper Fred Trump had always negotiated personally\nPrices for the things he bought boilers roofs but in Nineteen Ninety two bills for those items began being in voice from a company called all county building supply\nAll county within voice it get the money and then they would create another than boys to Fred Trump's businesses with a twenty percent thirty percent like pat added on to that or a hundred percent in some cases you say and some ... in some cases there were some cases right where they're getting things for free and then building\nFred Trump's businesses whenever the cat was would just be split\nBetween Fred Trump's for surviving children who are the owners have already\nThat's right and they were performing no work for that the only work was done by an employee Fred Trump's who was also and nephew of his and not employees secretary who handle these building things uh among her other tasks\nFor Trump give gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where\nHe bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino but there was one time the father pushed back against is on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia\nDonald Trump tried to change his father's well what happened\nThat was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by who's creditors and he had some lawyers right up a ... a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nHe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this you just had the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was\nAnd what the piece of paper in front of him his father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump's sister who was then a federal judge and the lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and Donald we wouldn't have any more\nControl or employed\nOver the state than any of his other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found
