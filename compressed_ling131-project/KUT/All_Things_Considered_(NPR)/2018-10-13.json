{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "... from the BBC Wilson is with me Joan ...\nAndrew Brunson has returned to the United states is you may have said on last night's news on the American pastor who'd been working in Turkey for two decades was released in a court hearing on friday a decision which surprised many he was detained two years ago on spirit is kind of terror related charges\nAnd although he was like the freedom to house arrest he's case considerably strained relations between the U.S and turkey\nJust over an hour ago he spoke at a press conference at the White House with President Trump\nWants to spend time with our children especially and then take some time to\nPray and we love this country of last night we arrive in Germany and the ambassador to Germany met us Sarah what thirty in the morning I couldn't believe it and he had an American flag that had fallen over\nIn Berlin and I took it very naturally just I just I Love this country\nWe prayed for this\nWell Tony Perkins commission and with the U.S commission on international religious freedom a company pastor Brunson on the journey back from turkey so how's the pasta doing\nOh he's doing well or he uh I can see the the relief come over him when we were wheels up out of turkey a friday night and ah once we got out of the Turkish airspace or he began to relax\nAnd then of course when we uh we stopped we were stopped for about seven hours in Germany and then made our way out today and to to D.C and as we got closer closer some anticipation you hadn't seen his children in a while\nThere was a it was a ... a sea of emotions I think that came over him as he and his wife both as we landed at Andrews Air force base\nAnd did you get any sense from him of what that when he turned up for the hearing a few days ago was that he knew he was going to be released\n[noise] no no one knew exactly what was going to come of a friday's hearing\nIn fact uh the the hearing oh started off with a two witnesses retracting their statements are saying that their statements were incorrect so it looked like the government's case which was in a case to begin with what was their\nHere say was falling apart but then the prosecutor in the afternoon\nOr read by the sixty two page or what's similar to an indictment are calling for him to be in prison and removed from house arrest and that was his greatest fear is that he would go back to prison\nAnd so at that moment panic came over him and his wife and his supporters that were there and that lasted for about forty five minutes until the judges or a recess came back in and then issued their opinion which led to him being able to leave the country\nAnd what did he say about the conditions in which he was held in how we go through it\nWell it was difficult I I didn't go into a a lot with him uh regarding the conditions I mean there were cramped conditions that initially\nBut there was just the the ... the ah confinement that he was not able to to move about he was separated from his wife or his family many milestones within the family occurred during these are two years as daughter\nAh graduated uh gotten married to and there were deaths in the family and so\nIt's been a very very difficult ordeal and in part of it was the uncertainty not knowing and anticipating a potentially thirty five years in prison a ... that weighed very heavily on them certainly relieve now to be back in the United\nStates and just generally are in the White House the president jokes with the ... that he thought he didn't suppose you'd be heading back to check he any time soon but pastor Brunson said he actually had you know deep love the turkey and the Turkish people\nWe discuss that way and that's why he was there for twenty five years or he loves the Turkish people and and what's fascinating ah John is that he harbors no bitterness no anger toward turkey or he is just great quote grateful to ah to the United states the menace ration President Trump the vice president secretary of state\n... it's a great day for a lot of people here in the United states\nAnd that was Tony Perkins what did not Whitehouse press conference President Trump repeated what he's earlier in the day said on Twitter name me that there's been no promises made in return for the past is really\nIt was absolutely no deal and frankly they only deal if you could call it a deal is a psychological once we feel much different about turkey today than we did yesterday and I think we have a chance of really becoming\nMuch closer to ... maybe even having a very very good relationship we know the people as the pastor said these are incredible people\nSo most of them really no deal made ambassadors ... is a former U.S ambassador to turkey from two thousand two thousand and three and a scholar at the middle East Institute\nTechnically that's right but in fact\nThe Turks are going to expect more then Josh is a few seats thanks to president aired won and frankly the United states should be doing something now to show turkey that it really does want to move back to a closer relationship so uh I think we should be watching\nOr what the us does that would make the Turks feel like they can now I'm getting to a better discussion and dialogue with us about the problems that still could front us\nFrom what might those things they want to get in return\nWell there are two or three options there uh\nIs the question of the tariffs on aluminum and steel which were the latest ones imposed the latest sanctions against turkey another possible issue which is a great point of the American attention to the ... case\nThe fact that President Trump is going to receive hockey's Jay Jay ... is the ah fiance a a\nA Mr could show me\nA is another sign of solidarity with the church in this issue\nHe take with a pinch of salt than the president's saying these two big stories happening at the same time in turkey just coincidence he said\nWell in that sense in a chronological since they were ... that's but in terms of substance or one gives the chance for the U.S to show solidarity with turkey a and in a way in at a time when it can't help but be beneficial\nPresident did one for his part he said an entirely independent judicial decision saying saying you'd ... you'd have by\nThere is no independent judiciary in Turkey I Wish there were but there isn't\nJust one final thoughts way less than a month away from mid term elections in the United states watching those images that in the White House of the past the kneeling and praying that with President Trump it's hard not to see that that is going to sit pretty well with evangelical Christians\nAre just a few weeks away from those elections\nThat is true this will be a a boost to a voter turnout and to the president's campaign before November six\nYou say are you say a boost you think that the timing coincidental that no\nIt's not coincidental but in any case the Turks have the right to decide when they would release a pastor Brunson October twelve was a perfect moment for that to happen I think they were driven by their own calendar rather than the American calendar but these events all will help President Trump by in the November six elections\nAnd that was ambassador rubber piss in bringing this edition of news out to a close for me

considered from NPR News I'm Shereen Marisol Meraji in Georgia allegations of voter suppression or grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nBe as we should be but I think the only problem with this whole scenario and there's a crowd of me between your your Taylor is that there aren't more high profile celebrities who are engaging in the political process are willing to voice their opinion or political issues\nAnd it's interesting how despite this being a country where we talk about how much it matters to be involved in political processes\nRedeem that it's bad for business to be vocal about it and so here we are in this room where these too loud voices are seen to be diametrically opposed but a ... that it wouldn't look so down the middle if we heard from the voices that words are profiled as they were\nJuliet do you agree with that that we need to get more celebrities talking about politics I can hear a lot of people saying no no no that's exactly what we don't need well\nObviously like the rest of your ... as a journalist I think anyone should be able to say anything that they want to\nUm within reason personally I don't care if more celebrities talk about politics or not but I Do think that was the Taylor Swift kind of a west thing um that shockingly not a few between the two of them this time\nI think what it shows us is just how deeply people's political views are linked to race ... um\nBecause right now Democrats particularly black ones are mad at ... because he's supporting someone who has a history of saying racist things has a history of doing racist things\nAnd we'll Taylor Swift people are upset with her because they thought that she was there and queen or whatever that is supposed to mean so yeah I think that this whole situation really shows us that we can separate race from politics because so many voters don't do that\nAnd test the I'm Wondering if people are really going to stop being fans of these musicians\nWork stopped being fans of their music just because they decide they're going to get into politics and because they you know have controversial views or if they're just going to be like whatever ... going to be amazing I'm Still listen to it anyway Taylor Swift she's poppy and great and they left to listen to her on road trips I don't really care if they get into politics\nWhat I Will say about Taylor is that for a long time she didn't speak about her political views and she said back in two thousand twelve that the reason she didn't speak about her political views was because she didn't feel like she had enough life experience to for anyone to to really like take her advice and she didn't want people to vote\nBased on what she said because she didn't feel like she knew enough about it so I think that there is something really powerful about the fact that she is speaking up\nNow that she's speaking up after you know playing the important role in a sexual harassment lawsuit that she won last year I think that she really has come out with her political views in a way that is\nPowerful and is thoughtful and I think that you have to take a holistic view when you're looking at this\nAnd that was Rolling Stone reporter tests
