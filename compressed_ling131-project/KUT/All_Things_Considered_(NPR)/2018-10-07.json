everyone on the ... you know how did you see that resignation\nOr how do you know him personally you tend to the resignation of ... it's all very very few but from that point of view he's no longer the leader of that's quite clear because of the things on the other news today goes is that we have a confirmation from Beijing that some men who ways is in\nDetention or is being questioned in an

from the point of view is\nChina's standing around the world is pretty disastrous I mean if this can happen to such a senior figure in the international body that he can simply disappeared from one day the next and be discovered in the interrogation southern Beijing I mean you know ... international body is going to\nTrust the leading positions to do to Chinese figures\nAnd of course there's a

from him was a ...\nThis is on the day he disappeared in the twenty fifth or September which she took obviously is a fine look I'm In danger she read out a statement in Chinese and English and saying

presidential elections but what we have had all the exit polls for some of the governor and state races the sentences insightful\nAnd all those exit polls suggest and of course a note of caution as

place in the three most populous states including here in Rio\nDe ... so there is there was a loss of the the talk very experienced who joined us here in Brazil\nThe ... and all night just might be on course to win in the first round which would mean him getting more than fifty percent of the votes and we think that they were searching candidates in this field\nThat would be the most remarkable achievement statistically on of course it would be the most significant political achievements results anyway for Brazil because this is a man with a very ... fall ride views on a host of subjects who served in the past\nOr I'm In favor of dictatorship\nNow of course we have to ask but just how reliable of exit polls have been before [noise]\nWell [noise] you know as as we've exit polls in any country they they go to check your history\nBut I think what we are seeing from these exit polls is the suggestion of a swing of the movements of the mention you know where we're going to wind up we'll find out\nThat she'll be enough certainly will be off the news ... book called the indications are and you know I have to say it's it's hardly scientific but anecdotally from what I'd be leaning in recent days and certainly today\nThat just doesn't seem to be a real acceleration to the uh the momentum that Mr ... has achieved\nIn the closing days of the campaign and you know we will see it in

I'm going to ask you how seriously do you take the divisions of the moment are the wheels coming off the Democratic project [noise] well\nI think they're very very serious the degree of polarization is the single biggest weakness in American society and the American political system which means that we can't make routine decisions like appointing Supreme Court justice it also means that it's seeping into society so it's not simply that were disagreeing over\nIt'll policies like abortion it also means that as Americans as as individuals we are increasingly just trusting one another disliking each other on a on a personal basis and\nYou know I think the the hearings demonstrated that we're even perceiving the same events in the same effects in such different ways that they're really doesn't seem to be common ground for having actually a civil discussion\nAnd so I think this is a continuation of a process it's been going on for quite a few years though but it's really accelerated I think in the last two\n... and ... with you because you wrote a piece in the times where you mentioned that people across the west are expressing his concerns is not just in the United states but you also said that understanding history would give us optimism for the future what makes you so sure about that\nOh well if you trade the oscillation the ups and downs of the Democratic project\nReally on both sides of the land you need to have I think that transatlantic might that I'm not saying that because I'm calling you from Prague\nAt if you do that you see that that our democracy have come through equal and greater challenges are more substantial than the ones we face now often there's agreement there was disagreement about\nUs entry into World War one there was the first time this agreement before World War two the Marshall Plan was fully funded until after the Cold War but God and every time we're able to come together in the genius of the Democratic\nProject charted it in my new book the last ... looking at that sensory from here in Prague and so I'm confident that we'll be able to overcome that and perhaps the last play\nOh where where I might take a faction perhaps you ... you is I think it's a symmetrical do not think that it's a matter of both sides I Believe that there\nIt was a tremendous rate in the Democratic process in the way that Kavanaugh's nomination was handled and so once we're able to read drafts\nRoad you know as we always are I think we'll get back to the to the more normal turbulent democracy that instead of it or an extreme version\nI invested or what should we do about this then\nWell I think on the on the uh to\nTake the example of the\nThe Kavanaugh nomination um uh but there's so much more and the Trump Administration they the same could be set up we need to acknowledge what the baseline that this was not a normal process\nI worked when I was in the White House on to Supreme Court nomination\nWe turned over every page of\nJustice Elena Kagan as White House document\nThis White House withheld hundreds of thousands of pages you had an FBI investigation I wrote about what a normal one would have looked like a mission to ... this was an abnormal and limit hit one you had an extremely unusual unprecedented party's been shipped by the nominee I knew\nAbout it but I'm going to ask you we don't have we have limited time so I'm going to ask you briefly\nTo tell us what direction we should go in going forward and then I Want to turn it over to the professor again I should we do not\nI mean we have to acknowledge what was wrong and it must be\nMade right I Believe there will likely be some regret in the mid term uh when some more accountability may come to at least want it not both houses of Congress and that regret will help heal what broke\nProfessors who can you actually belong to a project called better angels which is an effort to bring conservatives and progressive together to reduce polarization used very it's very structured it's very intentional about how is that going and what do you hope to accomplish if\nIt's one of a lot of grassroots efforts to build civility across the country but I actually think that that by itself is not going to turn on the trip because\nThis is something I think that really needs leadership I I agree with the ambassador that the the blame ... symmetrical I mean we have a president who instead of trying to actually unite the country around some common interests have done everything he can to try to increase the degree of polarization\nBut in a certain sense it means that uh you know there's grounds for optimism because if it is the result of\nThis kind of what I Would regard is really bad leadership it means that somebody with a different agenda you know could actually begin to emphasize you know common national identity things that are Americans actually hold in common and walk us back a little bit from the precipice of ...\nSo if there were ... we only have a minute left So Professor ... if that leadership is not there what should people be doing in the interim\nShould vote I mean I Do think that fundamentally you know a lot of this is a political fight and I think that if you're you know I I really do think the upcoming election in November as one of the most important in American history because I Do think that that's the ultimate way that Americans have of holding their leaders accountable\nAnd there's going to be big implications drawn depending on the way that this election goes and I think that's really that's the way that in a democracy you exercise your agency and you know express your democratic will\nSo much more to say I'm Sorry we're running out of time but more to
