U. T. joins us from Austin with or high Ashley hay and let's listen to one of a last night's fiery or exchanges this is Senator Cruz talking about our works relationship with President Trump\nWith congressman O'Rourke leading the way two years of a partisan circus shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the president that's not good for the state of Texas is not good for our country\nA singer ... response from you Mr O'Rourke\nReally interesting to hear you talk about it part of some circus after six years and in the U.S Senate\nThey're Cruz said during the debate that it is clear that congressman or works pollsters have told him to come out on the attack what do you make of his more aggressive strategy last night [noise]\nWell yeah All right 'cause that's when he changed his tone a little bit since the beginning of the campaign for most of the campaign or it wasn't even mentioning Ted Cruz in fact you know he didn't come up and rallies almost at all\nBut there are some Democrats in this day who had been expressing frustration that O'Rourke hasn't been more forceful in highlighting the very real real ways in which he is different from crews and with election day this close O'Rourke is probably finding it's important for those distinctions to be clear\nWhat was cruises strategy\nWell he's using the same strategy all along which is that he's making a case\nThat Texas is just too conservative for Beto O'Rourke\nWho cruises painted as this liberal um you know an extreme liberal that and you know it hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office in more than two decades so it could be that that's a really salient point to make 'em through this at a couple of times that if given the chance O'Rourke will take any opportunity to align himself\nPolitically an ideologically with what he calls the radical left that here's a good example that\nI Want to repeal Obamacare reduce premiums protect preexisting conditions and expand access congressman O'Rourke wants socialized medicine the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor I Want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going\nYet so crews have been making the case that Republicans have been delivering protections for a while now and ... wants to undo all that work\nNow or work has raised a lot of money record thirty eight million dollars just now making this the most expensive Senate race in history a he is counting on support from Texas who don't typically turn out to vote Latino voters young people are listening to a moment from his closing statement last night\nOn issues of immigration reform of the fate of dreamers nearly two hundred thousand state of Texas when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for dreamers ... senators showed up to Ninety seven loaded to move forward only one senator voted no Ted Cruz has put his career above the interest on where were you\nKnow people that are watching this election say it is going to be difficult for work to get people who don't typically vote to the polls what if people think about whether he can pull that off\nI mean this is the hardest task for any political campaign because it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money to make a non voter voter like a a campaign has to get in touch with someone at least six or eight times before they actually vote there's some research that suggests that\nThe first Democrat in Texas it's really the only way to win a statewide election that's because the non voting population and this is so big and the good news for better or get that he surely has the money now to invest in turning out people who don't often don't in Texas and I guess we'll find out whether that's spending with effective\nIn the last Democrat to believe that won statewide in Texas was Ann Richards or somebody back in the Nineteen nineties\nYeah almost twenty five years while\nNow a we mentioned that this is the most expensive race in Senate history you've reported on how the sheer amount of money in this campaign could be making some of the polling data unreliable\nYeah this is something that pollsters had been flagging for me because so much money is pouring and particularly in to the vet over our campaign\nUm he's doing the more expensive work of turning out voters at least he's trying to which means there are a bunch of new voters in the next that pollsters don't typically you know how to model for I mean since the last midterm and twenty fourteen about one point six million people were added to the roles in Texas\nAnd a lot of them were added in the final days of the registration period this month I mean I Can't tell all of that is because of her ... campaign\nThe pollsters have told me it's unlikely those voters show up in the polling that's being conducted right now or at least has been in the past\nIt can be very interesting to watch what happens in Texas Ashley Lopez senior reporter at K.

P. O. was a hundred and four billion that was back in twenty twelve or what what do you make of that difference\n[noise] [noise] well probably the the better way to think of her as a bit more like Amazon and that's pretty charitable on my end but\nThe idea is that it would be a logistics company right that it moves people move things that moves food\nAnd that there is a lot of different markets that are probably a susceptible to someone coming in and saying we can move these things around better and that's where it Hoover would like to be now look that there are a long way from that right now they are in money losing taxi company for the most part of a and so it's really just a question of\nCan they cross the bridge and become a real viable business\n... and ... unlike Facebook is not relying on advertising for its revenue\nIt's not they'll remember when Facebook went public no one really envisioned that would be its its Achilles' heel that the model was was deeply flawed who knows what what Hoover's Achilles' heel is but that they have different models and um what Hoover basically relies on his a lot of transactions and taking a small piece of that right so they do it in their\nRide hailing business they do it in their food delivery business\nUh they would like to be in the business of moving things and making a little money every time I'm it's also worth noting that of the miles driven in the U. S. ride sharing is still an unbelievably tiny percentage of it and so as people move more towards you know you've heard a lot of talk about\nThe gig economy right that we don't all you need to own everything we can we can kind of share resources\nIt's going to be a bumpy ride but uh there's a broad consensus that that's where the U.S economy in certain pockets particularly urban areas is headed and someone's going to win it and look if you want to put a hundred and twenty million dollar evaluation over you have to believe that ... is going to be the winner there\nThey might still be a tiny percentage of the actual moving of people but they're definitely a high percentage of the double parking as far as I can [laughter] yes and I was very of 'em are they're naysayers right now who think this hundred and twenty billion dollar figure is just way too hot\n[laughter] yes my inbox is full of them this morning um [noise] look and and it should be it's worth noting that this is just what what two very big bank Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley who are are um are very big underwriters of IPO's have said they think they could take the company public at there's a lot of\nIfs and butts and again some tuxedo sprinkled over the whole thing\nAnd and so there's no guarantee that that's the right number at all but look at if it's going to make ten billion dollars this year not ridiculous devalue company at ten or twelve times revenue obviously there's a profit behind that\nSo they need to figure out how to flip the switch and really make the profitable which is at the end of the day what public company investors are going to demand that said Amazon has very rarely turned a profit and its stock has has continued to rise so\nThe whole thing here relies on everyone kind of closing the rise and believe it\nThere's another aspect of this I don't want to ask you about we've been talking a in the last few days about the disappearance the alleged murder of Dr ... G A and Saudi Arabia is potential role in the world turns out that Saudi Arabia is a big backer of ... the the ...\nMohammed bin Salman invested three and a half billion dollars back in twenty sixteen in Hoover what about that aspect\nSo the Saudis are among the biggest investors in Silicon valley and that's been deeply uncomfortable for a lot of executives as this story has unfolded\nUm but Lugar's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said publicly he's not going to attend in Riyadh next week and I'm the Saudis do have a seat on were born they will be involved in any decision to go public and at what valuation and um so this is this is sticky uh and that's just the consequences of taking money from sovereign well funded you get involved in geopolitics\nOne more thing I Want to ask you about lift a is also preparing to go public next year but we're talking they're not about a hundred and twenty billion dollars but Fifteen billion dollar valuation\nLift for the moment is just a is mostly just a ... a ride hailing apps and so they they have a business that looks a lot like one of ... businesses\nSo lifted almost certainly not worth as much or in the grand scheme of things but there's a little bit of a it's a it's not totally clear like who should go out first right if you were lifted Hoover there's some value in maybe letting someone else test the waters first\nBut also it's not clear that public company investors are going to want to own both of these things as you lock the banks up until a little bit of an eye on each other for a couple of years um lift as much simpler and and smaller and ultimately at least you know at the stage less stable business\nBut it's always there when the Hoover is taking too long\n[laughter] and it has that little ashes you always know how hard\nIt was often who covers Wall Street for the wall Street Journal thank you thank you very much and here and I was a production of NPR and WB you are at association with the b._b._c.

Bush I ask how that went for him when he started talking about reforming Medicare so skin\nLook again with an eye on the upcoming elections in their second and possibly final debate of the Texas Democrat they don't recreate it really came out on the attack against the Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nWho is seeing a bump in some polls that ... calls cruise dishonest for saying he supported a ten dollar a barrel tax on oil here's Cruz's response\nWell it it gets clear congressman O'Rourke pollsters have told them to come out on the attack so if he wants to insults me and call me a liar that's fine but you know John Adams famously said facts are stubborn things\nNow Iraq did ones vote for an oil tax but it never ... on a cruise it yet cruised it I'm not an oil tax it never became a but I was able to use Donald Trump's own words against cruise last night um just your thoughts Alison what would you ... you know what would you advise as a strategist well first\nOf all look clearly over ... is resorting to name calling instead of looking at the record when he spent three times as much as Ted Cruz and he's still behind but ten points in the polls and I I was\nTen cruises communications director and the twenty sixteen campaign and I can still hear line Ted in my head but then you heard it last night [laughter] exactly and here's the thing if you if you look at the issues that are important to people of Texas Beto O'Rourke doesn't represent those issues he's from government funded late term abortions socialized medicine open borders\n... and he's advocating for wind and solar energy in Texas of all places so what what people saw last night was a ... a candidate that\nAre clearly he might get a lot of media attention and has a lot of money but his values are not reflective of Texas at the end of the day but Republicans and the people of Texas will come home to to someone that has represented them well with their values and nuts Ted Cruz and that's what we'll see a lot of these Republican Senate races across\nThe country gym out or would you recommend a beta ... continue that you know swinging coming out swinging ... what would you say\nCertainly has come out swinging look I'm not a tax and but I did do a lot of ah lived in South Carolina south [laughter]\nIn the south in some would argue with my taxes to solve the problem with our understand but there's a real ... where there's a real concern here because a lot of Americans are going through real problems like opioid abuse\nAnd people were more care not less care I think the ... and we're talking about different populations of people there are lots of Latino voters in Texas where I think probably care about making sure the babies are separated from their mothers at the border when they crossed by the government\nYou know there's real issues so bad or work and Ted Cruz maybe talking to two different parts of Texas\nAnd by the way it was in fact ... okay was alright supposed to have a voted high dollar a barrel [laughter] there's a whole the whole fact check about it in the Texas Tribune people can go and check it out I'm\nJamal or just quick do you think that it was a silly that
