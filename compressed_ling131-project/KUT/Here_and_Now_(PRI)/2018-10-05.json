{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Ms loses mention of the president's actions earlier this week a campaign rally in Mississippi where he mocked a Kevin ... accuser Christine Blasey Ford interestingly\nThe president had another campaign rally last night in Minnesota\nAnd he didn't go down that road I think the president's advisors had told him a mocking Christine Blasey Ford was not helpful in particular with those key swing senators\nAre Susan Collins Jeff Flake both of whom denounced the president's action but of course voted yes to to proceed with the the nomination today and Lisa Murkowski who go to the opposite\nWith well let's talk about now what is going to happen a just war Nina Totenberg and Ron Elving I'm going to ask you for your final thoughts you're in a moment as we near the end of our special coverage but first let's go to NPR's to medical months' narrow who covers the politics covers the process to medical what happens now\nWell we've got this final for a you know senators who everyone's watching a flake of Arizona Collins of Maine Joe Manchin of West Virginia Lisa Murkowski\nOf Alaska three of those four would be needed on the final vote to be able to sing Kavanaugh's nomination if that is in fact what happens Murkowski looks like she's already and know given she's voted against her\nNow an interesting thing about Susan Collins she has voted yes previously for education secretary Betsy ... out of committee yeah but\nShe voted no on her on the floor in the final vote so we don't know that what she did today has any bearing or indication of what she will wind up doing on a final vote unless\nShe could vote no she gets what your vote and Republicans her abs Justin to correct\nBut let's play out the scenario Murkowski as a no colon somehow comes out and vote no is Joe mansion really willing at that point to be the fifth vote to have Brett Kavanaugh confirmed thereby needing a vice president Pence to come in and break that fifty fifty tie\nDoes Joe Manchin want to be the Democrat who eventually puts Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court that is an interesting scenario\nLet's go next to Ron Elving is covered so many political battles in Washington Ron what thoughts are on your mind as we as we get through this day\nSo many battles but none quite like this never saw a confirmation hearing where the nominee\nBehaved in such a manner that he had to venture into the wall Street Journal and do an op ed to apologize for the way in which he ... himself or at least you shouldn't have said some of the things I there are some things I shouldn't have said comes as close to an apology as I suppose most people would would would expect\nOf that's unusual the the way the hearings were conducted was highly unusual this vote on the floor of the Senate is highly unusual having a cloture vote on a Supreme Court nominee is highly unusual\nSo a lot of rules have changed and a lot of norms and traditions\nHave been overturned in the last two years really starting with twenty sixteen and the handling of Merrick Garland then with the election of President Trump then with the decision by the Senate Republican leadership to do away with the availability of filibusters for Supreme ... which means we can come to a point of fifty one forty nine and a cloture vote\nSo all of this is new and uncharted territory and it suggests that going forward things are going to be more disrupted then they're going to be like the best\nAnd now let's turn to NPR's Nina Totenberg or I Believe we set on the air the other day and you know that you have covered the confirmation hearings of every single sitting Supreme Court justice is that right\nYes remark that you've done that by the age of thirty five animated ... able to get a but but let me just ask we have a fifty one to forty nine vote here I mean literally that's the news is just a cloture vote and it's not even the final vote but in a broader sense what has happened today what just happened\n[noise] well it's the fulfillment\nAs far as I can see and it and I am not Claire buoyant but it's it's the fulfillment of the increased\nPoliticization of how we choose people for the federal courts as we speak this week they're having hearings on another five or ten lower court judges and that was on her up\nUntil about two years ago to today and then they move that many together much less this late\nIn ... close to an election they ... they just stopped at a certain point over the summer\nIt was sort of some sort of comedy C. O. M. I. T. Y. between the side sit in the election is coming up that could change things instead we go into full throttle Russia mode and free democratic presidents especially Clinton and Obama\nConstitutional law professors were late getting started nominating people they took their own sweet time while they hadn't majorities and then were found themselves incredibly blocked by Mitch McConnell's very strategic ways of doing things now McConnell has the whip hand\nAnd using it very strongly and Democrats will come back inevitably with a whip in their hands and as you said this has parallels to the middle east ...\nUh deep and profound issue for Republicans to change the kinds of people who were nominated as judges and as you point out it's not just the Supreme\nCourt vitally important as that is it's lower courts as well and President Trump has moved an awful lot of them\nOver the last couple of years let me ask how much that matters um\nConservatives will say the conservative judges or just interpreting the law obviously they'll interpret differently than a liberal judge but there's still the law and especially in the higher courts judicial rulings our collective decisions of multiple people who serve\nAn institution should we think that that much changes really on the way\nI think we probably could see a court that's more conservative than any court in at least a sixty Seventy eighty years going back to the new deal I'm not sure of course and the Supreme Court is always in modern times anyway had the respect of the public much more than the other two branches of government\nI Would be very sorry if I ended up covering an institution that was viewed as just political but we are in danger of people are going to their corners on the court and right now it's just the Senate and the basis but\nYou don't want to you know the the crown jewel of the American democracy as the late shift justice rank was set is our independent judiciary and we don't want to lose that and the respect for that\nHasn't the chief justice that you've covered John Roberts spent years trying and various subtle ways to reinforce the seeming neutrality assuming into ...\nAnd a lot of people thought that his vote to uphold the um the ... area for double CARE Act was in essence an effort not to inject the Supreme Court into the politics of the moment\nAnd essentially say the president wants this so it's what I ought to go along\nWell not just the president that Congress passed it by Israel alone I\nLike I should go along with Nina thanks very much for your inside really appreciate it\nWe've also been hearing from NPR's Ron Elving NPRs to medical ... we've heard from many other individuals Kelsey Snell Scott Detrow Brakkton Booker and others through the last couple of hours of special coverage let's just briefly review what has happened on the Senate floor today by a final vote of fifty one to forty nine senators have\nDecided to advance the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh that is simply ending debate what next happens likely tomorrow is a vote to actually confirm Brett Kavanaugh and fifty votes would do the job fifty votes plus vice president Pence\nSo he can afford to lose only won a handful of votes not entirely\nCertain you can be sure that will continue covering this on NPR dot org at all things considered this afternoon and in a special report on your local member station this is NPR News\nGood morning it says Austin's NPR station Katie Katie HD one often end on line ... community supported public radio from UT Austin\nWill return now to our regularly scheduled program which is hearing now I'm Katie Ninety point five also coming up in the eleven o'clock hour news headlines on NPR and this week's been summoned to get involved getting involved\nChinese spotlight this month on Austin Center for grief and loss stay with us for that\n\n\n\n... than today to class and this guy that you ... percent chance we'll see some storms for the first day at a Seattle as expected in the upper eighties Seventy nine degrees in the capital city coming up on eleven o'clock for the weekend some rain in the forecast as well thirty to forty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr right and then something seems to have shifted we are going to be speaking to a woman on the program who is a Republican who's backing Kavanaugh because she just doesn't believe someone like him to do something like this\n... why don't even you know at the broader things that he's been accused of the drinking what happened\nHere over the course of the past week\nWell I think a lot of people look at the uh the ... the second hearing where a judge Kavanaugh came in and um as for retired Justice John Paul Stevens put it really went off script what a Supreme Court nominee was supposed to do in front of the Senate so\nThat really shifted the minds of a lot of people on the left but on the right they saw a man who's willing to defend himself who was who's passionate about protecting his quote unquote armor or just these what he called on unsubstantiated allegations so that was the same type of play that we saw President Trump used during the election\nBe out there be strenuous talk ran and talk strong be mad about what's going on and it seems to have re energize his supporters on the right that he was willing to to to actually go out there a stand up for himself rather than be passive\n... get that because posting to show that in fact this has re energize the Republican base in particular Republicans winning\nOr there's no question but I think the key thing here is that what works in the house is not necessarily work in the Senate worse in red places and blue places you're going to be different impacts on this and and I actually think this is one of those cases where\nThe loser wins politically in the sense that\nAnger is the fuel of twenty Eighteen and it's a lot easier to be angry or about not getting your way by being blocked from your way so if Democrats fall short and blocking justice cabinet I Do think\nThat you're going to see a surge in democratic enthusiasm is on the other hand Republicans fall short even to see a whole lot of angry Republican voters getting off the sidelines before the midterms it could be one of those weird situations where what works for the battle doesn't necessarily work for the war\nAnd I just want to read or something that has come in Lisa Murkowski has been speaking with reporters and says this has truly been the most difficult decision that I've ever had to make\nI Believe he Brett Kavanaugh has a good man it just may be that in my view he's not the best man for the court at this time Rick that sounds like she's going to vote against him\nYeah I mean I think that's clear that that does that Lisa Murkowski is a is a no on this ah ... and she voted no on the closer question but that's a fascinating answer if you think about it because I think it does recognize the broader steak that this is not about\nIs this guy qualified to be on the court who do you believe it's about them the moments in this country it's extraordinary outline that we've seen over the last three weeks is Christine Blasey Ford came forward and the last year the me too movement I feel like it's all been wrapped up in this moment a national conversation that's very real for the Senate they're supposed to make a difference\nYeah hey look a little bit more about Justice Stevens and as you you were um Ninety eight years old he comes out last night to say that he had been there in favor of Kavanaugh that you can have\nA sitting Supreme Court justice who says things in his testimony like what goes around comes around this kind of a threat uh some Kavanaugh meaning what who knows what this means Jesse for the court that you might have a Supreme Court justice he now he's since apologized but that extraordinary Wall Street journal\nOp ed saying you know maybe I was a little over the top\nUm but where does this mean\nFor the court when you have a former Supreme Court justice saying this person doesn't belong and of course\nWell if I were on the Republican side of the day of the Republican politician I Would be really worried right now because you have a former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens saying publicly I was for this guy but after I heard his heard him speak\nI'm now against this guy and that I have Susan Collins who you would assume would be a yes so she's already voted yes for closure saying I have an announcement I have to make later today\nThis is all should be really concerning to to judge Kavanaugh supporters\nAnd even if he gets on the court I mean I've been watching the court for about ten years now even if he gets on the court is going on the court with a ... a retired justice saying you shouldn't be there I don't think I've ever seen that happen to anyone even if he gets on the court he he he started she started a bit tainted\nRick if Kavanaugh is confirmed how energized do you think Democrats will be in the midterms how energize will Republicans be\nThe key thing for me to remember in and remind people love is the Democrats were already energized you can't lose suburban moms twice and that's the Republican argument that says this is going to be a net positive for them\nRepublicans have been reminded of why they're Republicans at all this has been a moment to ... to unify the anti the never Trump or is an demographer folks everyone seems to be together on the case of Brett Kavanaugh Lisa Murkowski's ... not withstanding\nSo I Do think Republicans are looking at this as a net positive I'd also say there were four weeks ago we spent the last three of them talking about\nA a judge Kavanaugh if the next four are consumed by other things they wild wacky things because it's politics and twenty a team that would not at all surprised me and I don't know how many voters ultimately are going to make up their decision purely on this fight that happened and it happened to consume the better part of a month I hear in the fall\nBut somebody mentions morning on MORNING edition that in fact I remember just a few weeks ago somebody wrote in anonymous letter from the mistakes you\nHeard on him and that you know he just there was that that moment which has passed and then you get today the Labor Department news the unemployment rate falling asleep point seven percent the lowest level since December Nineteen sixty nine I mean getting a job Jesse just briefly that it never happens again it right on that and they should\nAnd in a normal election year you would hear every one in every Republican in the house and the Senate and the White House crowing today about what the the historic\nUnemployment numbers that we see but what are we talking about we're talking about judge covenant hassled that's just shows how weird this year's been and how strange these next four weeks could be well\nAnd the next twenty four hours we really don't know what is going to happen and we'll be watching all of it a Jesse Holland and recline thanks to both of you thank you thank you hit
