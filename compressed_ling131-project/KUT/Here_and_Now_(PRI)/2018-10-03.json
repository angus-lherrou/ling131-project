remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want to\nAlso well all eyes are watching the Kavanaugh controversy the EPA is taking steps to roll back rules on radiation and mercury\nThese stories and the delightful new novel the mermaid and this is Hancock centers on the fascination in Eighteen century England with roommates but then the ... kind of makes you could explores\nThe ocean and you kind of want to be a humanoid creatures do something recognizable in it coming here now in the news is first\nAnd is that story just gobbled up the headlines in Washington the Trump Administration has been busy rolling back key environmental rules\nAnd just the past few days there have been new plans to weaken regulations on mercury emissions and on and radiation exposure as bringing Timothy came up he's in energy and environment reporter at the hill Tim thanks for joining us\nThanks for having me on Peter let's start with this news about the EPA plan to loosen regulations on radiation exposure what do we know about that\n[noise] so this was a sort of a fold in in a regulation that you've created in April proposed\nTo sort of change how they evaluate um whether something is scientifically sound they're proposing to potentially look at the models that they use for a value waiting the risk of exposure to various things like radiation or\nOr other cancers substances currently I'm In previously ... kind of assumed that\nAny amount of radiation or you know similar cancers substances can be dangerous you know even if it's just one and a million risk of um of cancer it's named that can be quantified I'm now this regulation and specifically mentioned radiation but nonetheless I could have an impact in terms of\nYou know evaluating exposure from contaminated Superfund sites or population level exposures to things like radiation\nSo who could have defects and thinking you know there's people that nuclear facilities oil and gas drilling rigs technicians who are giving you an X ray at the dentist office that sort of thing\n[noise] exactly and again since this particular regulation doesn't doesn't mentioned radiation area windy and media thing when this regulation is as high a wise but you know when they're conducting those scientific research and looking at the data for something like people who live near\nA near sites with a lot of radiation this has the potential to change how UPA is going to evaluate them\nOkay over the last couple of days we're also hearing that the Trump Administration is trying to make changes that would weaken regulation on mercury ... what would that mean\nRight there looking back at a twenty love in a major regulation from the Obama administration that\nReally was responsible for shutting down a lot of coal fired power plants they're not actually looking at this point at changing that regulation they're looking at changing the cost benefit analysis behind that the Obama administration estimate that it would this regulation what caused nine point six billion dollars but with health benefits are about ten times that\nTo the Trump Administration they don't believe that a lot of the\nPollutants that were used to come to that benefit figures should really be counted and the you know only mercury should be counted\nSo I Want to make sure that I'm clear here the change that we are talking about would not allow the EPA to consider the health benefits of reducing pollution that's something that the industry calls co benefits right\nExactly well you know this current ah administration they believe that they directly regulated substances in this case mercury and some other\nToxic air pollutants the benefits from this regulation to reducing those should be considered but when you shut down coal fired power plants who also reduce particulate matter nitrogen oxides other things that are really have a big public health impact and this administration doesn't believe those should be considered\nSo when you change that cost benefit analysis it really has the potential down the road to either prevent this regulation from from getting stronger or a a potentially even to repeal it's in the future\nThere is a tie here as there is a the last couple of days on many stories in the news do Brett Kavanaugh I'm into doesn't in fourteen the coal industry sued to roll back this mercury regulation and it lost in the U.S court of appeals in Washington DC\nWell judge Kavanaugh who serves on that court wrote the dissenting opinion and he argued that the mercury will was too expensive\nFor the coal industry so if Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court he could be ruling on this case if if it goes that far\n[noise] exactly you know and and his whole record on the DC circuit has been somewhat skeptical of high costs regulations\nUm he specifically looked at co benefits the the pollutants that happened to be reduced trauma regulation yeah he he didn't believe it should be counted which would have made it a and not cost effective regulation\nSo those are two major rule changes that the Trump Administration is considering but there are many more ah I'm seen um the industry is getting a big win on a methane roll back potentially what else are you watching here\nYeah so the administration is on sort of a a big a regulatory rollback streak in these last couple of months UPA is working on\nA repealing Obama's administration standards to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas drilling that said polling greenhouse gas um but in so many corners of this ah masturbation on environmental policy their\nRollback coming I'm you know the clean Power Plan limiting carbon dioxide pollution from power plants the clean water rule um you know so so many other regulation left and right that in these last couple of months are moving towards either repeal or a significant role back\nInto who's behind all this because I'm sure that this is exactly what industry wants to see\nRight a lot of these changes are driven by industry and I either because of previous litigation or lobbying or what have you ah for example Murray energy is one of the biggest coal mining companies\nIn the United states its chief executive Bob Murray as I had strong support our President Trump\nUm the current acting administrator of the EPA Andrew wheeler used to lobby for Murray energy um but also a lot of industry groups national mining association the American Petroleum Institute and the like they are largely behind a lot of this but there are also things that the Republican Party and the Trump Administration have supported for awhile\nTimothy game of energy and environment reporter

I Know Frank had an early in the end and capable of misleading anyway\nOkay and some of his friends from the past are now also saying the exact opposite thing but um you know there are other groups that are supporting Kevin about taking a different approach by attacking Democrats\nRight one of those groups as a conservative group\nCalled the Citizens United or they haven't had claiming that liberal Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Kavanaugh and then the ad goes on to pretty much beer three Democratic senators a that's a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar by then there are several other campaigns out there a a pro Kavanaugh ad campaigns as well\nOkay there's a two pronged strategy on the stock Kavanaugh side here's part of a TV spot from the liberal group demand justice it features Christine Blasey Ford Senate testimony\n... worried and catch a not for days and terrified\nThat without that need that ... day and that was I never forget\nThis ad cuts back and forth

survivors\nUm the advised kind of modest a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on cable channels in Washington DC and a ... in Alaska and may as well there's a lot of that kind of targeting a particular senators who were going to be key in this vote\nRight um the ACLU now this is interesting not usually in the mix in this type of a political fight but this time yes\nRight they normally do not endorse a candidate for political or judicial office this is only the fourth time they've done it in Ninety eight years uh but uh they have a a million dollar ad campaign in a number of different states associating Kavanaugh\nWith Bill Clinton Bill Cosby Harvey Weinstein Matt Lauer Charlie Rose it's a really tough out\nAnd some of the groups that are involved in these ads they're nonprofits which which means what we don't exactly know who's got the money behind them\nRight these were called five oh one C. for a nonprofit organization they're supposed to be basically advocating for social change a but what's happening is they're using their money which we don't know where it comes from they don't have to disclose their donors and so really there in many ways they're kind of stuff player so Citizens United\nJudicial Crisis network demand justice all of those are what are known as dark muddy uh organizations\nThis is the way that American politics works today right and and it's

did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when\nJohn hears Trump last friday on force testimony\nI thought or just a motive is very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman [noise] very fun woman speak\nTo that a jump rate than it is this notion that he's not only president should speak a and B doesn't he know that people cut those two things together\nAnd you okay well well well look\nIf we're going to go back to should just is Donald Trump going to start talking like the expectation where for president\nI think we need to go back to watching the campaign and he would never did that as a campaign he hasn't done that in two years as president so let's take that expectation right off the table and all agree Donald Trump is never going to act like a traditional president second of all I Do think that Donald Trump spends a lot of time watching news\nListening to news probably a lot of NPR and you know what what we are hearing out there was this constant voice from the Democrats\nTrying to run this incredible negative attack against Kavanaugh and I think that\nYou know when we talked about these unpopular my God it's the same reason that it was the most unpopular Republican and democratic nominee for president in history we now live in this culture where it's attack attack attack all the time\nAnd so I Do think the president was frustrated I think he felt that he was not attacking professor Ford personally but pointing out questions about her uh her her sort of story because\nEverybody wants to talk about ... capital but nobody is talking about\nThat there was a report generated a ... by ms Mitchell that said that there are a lot of inconsistencies and added there were holes in her story and it's it's we all now say okay we got to believe that a woman and I\nUnderstand that from my from a history standpoint but tell me which women are we supposed to believe in this case the accuser the prosecutor or somebody like\nFeinstein who obviously somebody is not telling the truth about leaking documents\nCan I say this or a Robin and Peter is that there was Gorsuch\nAnd I was in the fight to to stop Gorsuch and he got through ... senator Harris' that something that was pretty amazing on Thursday I thought which was sheep sheep put she put forth Gorsuch\nAnd a cabinet and they basically have had the same trajectory they both went to Georgetown Prep um they they have kind of the same up a career trajectory and the one difference was there was sexual allegations against cabinet or such made it through we fought and but he's still made it through so I feel like this this notion of\nOf like we are dumpster diving and doing all of these things to stop to stop a cabinet or what not the ones that came for\nDamages areas I only ones who did that that that's\nNot the prospect of what our troop perspective is OK President Trump gets one pick now all of a sudden a second pick comes along and let's face it a sobering\nSecond ... we Kennedy was going to require not a surprise\nBut the goal right now is can we delay until the vote count is possibly going to change after this election and so you\nHave no moral ground to stand on you have to know who held this seat open for fourteen months who didn't give Merrick Garland a hearing so to say that\nDemocrats your dream with me that that that is a rural I'm saying I'm saying that you guys are being hypocrite that whatever the hell I oh I Know is that the\nDemocrats held onto a letter that they had for weeks and weeks and decided not to some layers by the way as senator Coons said let's just do a one week investigation and it's like okay we'll go along with that 'cause a Democratic senators on the judiciary said do it\nNow we all agree to that and all I'm hearing from the the Democrats is oh my gosh where did this crazy idea of the should only be argued that will came through
