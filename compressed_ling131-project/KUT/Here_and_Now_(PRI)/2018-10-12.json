I Want to bring in what's going on with the stock market this week because you know that could be an issue in the midterms as well especially in terms of what it says about the broader economy yesterday on Fox and friends\nPresident Trump once again criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates three times so far this year and that's one of the reasons why the stock market was going down this week\nYou know the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit to a cute little fish that's ridiculous what they're doing\nPaul thoughts how this will affect emitter\nOf the reality is the you know the economy has not played a big role in this election it is\nIt is doing well um you know uh but whether it's better than the improving at a better rate than under Obama that's all up in the air but the reality is they're trying to me is doing well but it still hasn't been a big issue for Republicans on a positive level um\nSo I don't know what the stock market or if it continues to crash was whether that would then create another bad and ah and sediment it's really hard to know because it's just been a weird election in which the cultural issues keep dominating and overcoming anything to do with the economy\nAnd you know I said this last friday and I said again just a few weeks ago a an anonymous member claiming to be well the times also claimed it was a member of the top administration rather than an led into New York times saying that they were you know they were running the show and that a President Trump could not and that's gone you know from our conversation but\nEntering into the conversation is weakest civility um after the brutal bruising Kavanaugh battle Republicans left on left on Hillary Clinton\nFor saying this on CNN\nIf we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect his strength\nAnd then you had former Obama attorney general Eric Holder kind of making a plan Michelle Obama's twenty sixteen mantra\nMichelle Williams says if you don't when they go low we\nGo low we\nHold her later clarified he said no we just have to be strong and that's why we don't physically hurt somebody but Trump Warren holder better be careful for what he wishes for well\nThe right of seizing on this one ... one of their just seizing on this as an example of how it's the Democrats that are being uncivil in what some saw as you know Brett Kavanaugh actually being the attack dog uh during the confirmation hearings\nDefinitely right we've heard a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill make this argument right particularly about the protests and uproar around Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings they talked about being shouted out of restaurants having people show up at their doors one Republican member of Congress talking about\nAbusive and harassing text messages that his spouse Scott I'm so Republicans have certainly tried to do that that reminds me of that backup twenty ten twenty a lot of Democrats using similar language about civility when it came to the Tea Party when it was on the rise I had a ... the ... elections really\nYeah and uh\nUh each side there's a lot of finger pointing on each side summers Associated Press national political reporter Paul came Washington Post congressional reporter we have the weekend coming you know maybe there'll be a break in the news\nNot not not not happening thanks evil thank you this is your\nKevin we've talked about it here now dot org and find a way that others will also tell different if you're taking over the counter melatonin he believes it doesn't work out concrete\nBut there are some things in the pipeline that will have to talk about that [noise] you know for the students here [noise]\n[noise]\nSupport comes from velocity credit union Austin local since Nineteen forty seven with a full range of financial services including online banking an app and mobile deposit about current certificates that the last ... dot com branches in Austin round rock in Cedar fire\nSupport comes from seat apart ascension now central Texans can schedule care for themselves and their Family Online anytime without breaking away from their day details on care and scheduling options can be found at gets eaten care dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\nGotta get a dollar raise All right I Want to [laughter]\nMake yourself a little ... yourself having to pay for a walk off the numbers are they call it\nThe right thing and you win money [noise]\nMy name is ... and you're listening to K.

J. was ... [noise]\nWant people to MIT [laughter] since they canceled match\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo Erica people in the documentary talking about how Chris Rock's jokes total this line that a lot of people would be afraid to cross isn't that kind of exactly what comedy is supposed to be to go as close as you possibly a\n... yeah but the way he did it was pretty intense and he had a a section of that O. J. bit where he talked about how you know Nicole Brown Simpson had a car that OJ bought for her that she let Ron Goldman drive according to his jokes\nYou know he kinda humorous the details are formation and then he says uh now I'm not saying they should have killed her but on the state and so\nIn that moment you're laughing but you're also like I'm laughing at the fact that he's you know saying that there might be a reason to explain why this guy might have killed her\nAnd now of course we understand that when it comes to sort of abusive relationships and things like that is not about anything that you can reason away but at the time there were some people who thought that way about how um abusive relationships work and he put his finger right on it saying\nOJ was wrong but here's a way of looking at this that you might not have thought about and there weren't many comics at that time that we're\nDoing that and I think we have some more tape here of Chris Rock talking about his oh did you\nSue easier to go he's innocent which is like I saw those routines and it's too easy to go to the monster the real buddy is in that middle\nOtherwise it's just preaching ... interesting point they're back to bring the pain there is this famous bet that is frankly hard to talk about ... said\nLet's let's let's get into it so you have this bit where he talked about the difference between in words\nAnd he's the actual word and black people and he he called it like a civil war going on in the black community and then he went on to tell these jokes about what in words do so he would say in words\nAlways want to credit for something that they're supposed to be doing an inward would say you know I take care of my kids were you supposed to take care of your kids now the context of this is that this was the mid Nineteen nineties when gangster rap is not only taking over black\nMusic is taking over pop culture and this idea of the sort of rebellious violent young black man was really taking prominence in pop culture but there's a bunch of black folks sort of looking at that and saying well\nKnow that doesn't really represent my values that's not really what I stand for and there's there's friction in the community\nAnd it was so tense at one point that he almost got into a fight with the rapper Tupac\nI'm In the documentary they talk about how one time\nUm he ran into to pop in a club to pop\nWanted to challenge him to fight because basically that in were versus black people with the N word is embodied by next the rappers like two ... and then also he did it in Oakland well they were a lot of black folks in Oakland who felt like well that's you're talking about me so they got married and they walked out so uh this was not a routine that was universally accepted\nBut yet articulated something that was happening on black culture that people haven't quite figured out how to talk about I mean I remember when I saw I was like wow I mean it's it's kind of thing that a lot of people have been thinking but how do you see it in a way that's funny but also makes the point and he found a way\nNo W Kamau bell is the director of the documentaries a comedian and his own right um what do you think motivated him to take the story on\nWell most connection to Chris Rock it goes back a ways I think ... first TV show Chris Rock was the executive producer and I think he helped them actually get that show on FX and so tomorrow who who is now he has a CNN show now United shades of America that's one and a Emmy Award\nAnd so it makes sense that somebody like that who knows race who knows standup comedy who knows a little bit about how to put a great documentary together would do this piece about someone who had been is TV godfather back in the day\nAnd talk about what was a pivotal moment for black comics and for black people in the Nineteen nineties in a in a pivotal moment for Chris Rock certainly\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans thanks very much you

to nail biting days on Wall street the Dow Jones cell five point three percent over Wednesday and Thursday its worst performance since February\nIt what's going on were those drops the beginning of the end for the bull market or merely a correction Michael Reagan is senior editor of Bloomberg News Hi Mike Hi Robyn so the market just started a higher today it's now back down a little\nAnalysts have been telling us said the drops over the last couple of days were reflection of concern about Trump's trade wars that President Trump is saying it's the fed which has raised interest rates a little bit is the economy's heated up others have agreed with that what what do you say\nWell it's such an rub it I've been trying to explain the stock market for a good twelve years now and I'll tell you there are some days when I can tell you with a hundred percent confidence what's going on\nAnd there are other days where the cops because it's a little bit lower this week I Would say it's sort of that lower confidence and certainly there are things you can point to for the initial a weakness that we saw in the markets starting about three weeks ago the rapid increase in interest rate\nUh there were a few companies that came out and pointed at the tariffs on China as a affecting their earnings\nAnd there was also the story from a Business Week about China are installing the secret chips on some companies' servers all of that really ah got the ball rolling but once it's started snowballing um it's very hard to explain specifically what caused it there's theories that\nThere are hedge funds are computerized hedge funds that we act to stuff like changes in the momentum of the stock market or the volatility\nAnd they tend to uh so aggressively when do those things shift into a new regime so the prevailing theory is that it started with concerns about interest rates and trade and then the selling got a little out of control by some of these a computerized a systematic strategies of of some of the quad hedge funds yeah\nSo so what what overall would you say about the economy because you know it seems to be going great guns um and you know ... ... and employment is low so where are we\nAre yeah I I mean that the current state of the economy that's all true um there is quite a bit of a uncertainty about ... how high interest rates are headed\nAnd what the ultimate impacts of the trade tensions between us and China will be so whenever there's uncertainty even though right now things are going great that uncertainty really can adds to the ... in the stock market specifically ah like we've seen over the past week well\nThis this has kept interest rates far below you know historic definitions of normal I mean they were super low after the crisis to try to get the economy rebounding and into thinking that as a a an economy heats up and the engine really starts to heat up the fed acts as a cooling\nYou know by by raising those into space just a little bit but then we hear President Trump\nCalling the fed loco and too stringent so what's your view what's too\nWell right I mean the fed is doing what you said the risk is that the economy over sheets and that inflation gets too high and that can basically cause a hard landing in the economy can cause sort of a reversal of these trends we've seen\nI think for President Trump's reviews the stock market as sort of choose alternatives approval rating and she's very interested in keeping keeping it high so he's not happy with the fed\nOr others have learned to not last yourself to the
