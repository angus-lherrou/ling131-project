anywhere from five hundred thousand seven eight hundred thousand people of Mexican origin including U.S born and Mexicans the children were deported\nWhy what was the ... why the early Nineteen thirties was I mean I think a lot of people didn't uh didn't at the time didn't have any idea of just what sort of immigration enforcement policy the United states had if there was a formal\nPolicy [noise]\nThere was a to some extent that was a racial and um is involved but also the argument that government officials made is that resources are limited during the economic crisis and they should already be shared with U.S born people\nSo we're talking about the great depression or essentially they started the greatest rush into the welfare programs that are that were lost in the early thirties [noise] uh what about the Mexican government what was their reaction when hundreds of thousands of Mexicans I'm\nAh or people of Mexican descent or or heritage began streaming back across the border\nWell there were under a lot of criticism from the left and the ride for not speaking for really about the problems with Mexico's with this country\nSo um they decided to set of Colorado's Asian program which provided land than tools and see the fertilizer to people in the northern region of Mexico the call that the colonization program so they encouraged people come back home\nYou know the sort of reminds me of this sort of push pull that there have been a a sort of waves in American history certainly through the twentieth century in which\nThe United states government wants to bring in a more laborers uh inexpensive labor and they often turn to Mexico you think of the service program for example which was started in the in the war time ever in the Nineteen forties uh and then you see a later in the Nineteen fifties another wave of mass deportations\nWas that that shows a pattern of us uh immigration policy they the ... the government or encourages people to come or when they're needed and they and discourage them from coming or deport them\n... during political okay comic crisis or a political crisis one we're facing today\nI think a lot of listeners have not heard of the Nineteen thirty mass deportations are a number Nineteen thirties mass deportations and I'm I'm Wondering if\nYou think about that what happened then and you think about the the the patterns as you know them to be as an historian and you overlay that over what's happening today what do you see [noise]\nWell there's a saying that history rhymes and the president\nOr the decision by the federal government to to draw people in when they're needed to expel them or what they're not needed is part of it also the political culture\nThat is newspapers a journalist as well as a politicians of all sorts and local governments are admitted traders contributed to this or\nThis or a an environment in which Mexicans are seen expendable object in the labor markets so it's not just the federal government than the U.S and Mexico that are complicit in this I think a\nLot of us are now as well as in the Nineteen thirties or complicit bought\nA with our pilots for example\nI mean it

a criminal record we've got very little on this guy or the posts that he made did seem to echo some sentiments that have been made by some politicians have out of there being global as particularly George Soros behind this caravan these debunk conspiracy theories but we don't know much about him yeah\n[noise] well uh the eleventh victims ah his eleventh making his alleged victims will uh be very beginning tomorrow in San ...\nYeah and I mean I just want to say the the way this community has come together is very impressive they're gathering last night we saw people from all face coming in saying that a Jewish community to help them in the past and they want to return the favor\nYeah and you know ... thank you thank you well yesterday President Trump called to congratulate far right candidate ... who was elected president of Brazil on Sunday\nSupporters hope he brings sweeping change to Latin America's largest country which is struggling with rising unemployment crime\nAnd corruption but both in our old he's also a very polarizing figure he's been called the Trump of the tropics joining us now is the BBC's Julia ... narrow and resulted in Rio de Janeiro\nHi Julia thank you thank you both in our oh we could tick off his extremist views are over the years about women extremist views about gay people about black people and at times he's even suggested that he supports a dictatorship and Brazil how polarizing is new president elect to Brazil\nWell he is a figure that's built his career with a very aggressive rhetoric aggressive towards minorities or he is a former military uh\nArmy captain and so he has defended the military dictatorship in the past\nHe has a paid homage to a figure that was a tortured during the dictatorship in Congress and this\nSpeech that usually resorts doing tolerance and that usually um talks about incriminating his opponents are just a week before he was elected he spoke of wiping the workers' party the left wing workers' party supporters\nFrom the face of Brazil is highly polarizing and is seeing a with fear among people who voted against him so it is quite a delicate moment for Brazil and an unprecedented moment in Brazil in history\nSo how did he rise to prominence so quickly because this was a man who also spent decades in Brazil's Congress without much of a legislative record\nYes precisely he really grew through his attacks towards the workers' party and was fueled by the huge anger and I think it's fair to say hatred that spreads towards the workers' party in Brazil after\nMassive corruption scandals that have emerged\nOver the past years so the workers' party left wing party was in government for Thirteen Years up people will remember the government of former president Lula Lula is now in prison since April of this year on corrupt and I'm On corruption charges yes and he's facing other charges as well\nAnd many people in Brazil are just fed up with the workers' party and think that they are to blame for the economic recession that we're facing for the huge levels of unemployment and for the problems that we're facing right now\nWell let's just tick through some of the problems that Brazil is facing you mentioned the economy Thirteen million unemployed in the country and violence is a major issue in this election sixty three thousand murders last year one of the worst murder rates in the world\nYes and both said that it has really capitalize these issues and has been speaking a lot about the issue of public security saying that he's going to take a\nA hard line stance against violence and with this he has often said that a police should not be punished by a killing while on duty if they're doing their jobs so he he's someone who defends the production for instance of\nThe age of criminal responsibility and Brazil from Eighteen to sixteen years of age he defends a that people should be able to own weapons and to be able to defend\nTheir own families from criminals so these conservative ideas have appealed to many Brazilians who saw him as a someone promising change and someone who is presenting himself as someone who's going to do something different\nWhat does the victory say this hard shift to the right to say about what's happening all across Latin America because both denaro is only the latest example of a conservative leader emerging in a region that for for many many years was known for politics on the left\n... we are seeing this wave of a conservative governments and parties that we see in Europe that we see across the globe\nAnd we've seen from now enter a South America with both ... and his rise here in Brazil or is bound to influence uh parties in other parts of the continent\nOne of the big campaign statements that he's made is that Brazil cannot be the next Venezuela easing propagating this idea that he's against communism he's against socialism and his entrance into government means that uh Brazil is getting rid of that\nThe problem is Peter that\nWe saw several aggressions happening in the run up to the elections towards opponents of both ... and what people fear is what this a hate speech can trigger and the population in general whether people who are more conservative might feel empowered to be\nViolent towards a gay people towards minorities\nEven if apple ... tries to Suze these wars as he becomes president\nAnd he does have an ally in President Trump called both in order to congratulate him on his victory that's the BBC's Juliet continental in Rio de Janeiro Julia thanks for your time pressure thinking

the man police suspect of sending pipe bombs to prominent critics of President Trump\nIn both cases federal investigators are looking at the men's prolific use of social media to spread their caustic ideas joining us now is Clint Van Zandt he's a former FBI profile and he's in Frederick Fredericksburg, Virginia clinic welcome back\nA good to be back with your first I just want to ask are your thoughts and has been an incredibly difficult a few days for this country as we've process the news about this pipe bomber and now the tragedy in Pittsburgh how's all this weighing on on you or someone of formula involved and very closely with law enforcement\nWell unfortunately they're tragedies going on in the United states every day\nI think the challenges for the public as well as law enforcement we just see so many\nPeople acting out in violence or were conflict resolution used to be resolved in words now people are turning to weapons\n[noise] thankfully there there is a suspect in custody in the Pittsburgh shooting he has admitted to police that he wanted to kill all Jews but of course the investigation is not over FBI agents will be busy still in the coming days what are they going to be looking for\nWell I can both of these cases ah the shooting as well as the pipe bomb through the mail we we have a case of a man looking for a mission they're trying to find a reason for their lives\nOr someone who is unfortunately in this country is always looking to blame someone else for their challenges their shortcomings\nIn the case of the FBI this becomes you got one more investigation once the terrible dramas over with once the body count has done then investigators move in and they have to put her case together for court or they have to come up with all the physical evidence that's why we're told the synagogue could be closed at least a week\nBecause every bullet went through a person or a wall has to be documented and this of course we're all have to be introduced in court one more time this individual's obviously innocent until proven guilty of this terrible crime in the FBI the local police and others have to very methodically\nDo their investigation just because the individual was caught at the time was shot at the time are we still have to prove this and of course that's the way we always wanted to be in America\nNow both men in both of these crimes they had such a presence on social media prolific digital life spewing hate online how fertile will those postings be in an investigation\nI think they'll be very important unfortunately we have individuals who use the Internet to both uh speak to like minded individuals no matter how terrible these\nMines may be a a bunker commonalities they have and hatred or the shooting to synagogue will be assume oblique you hate crime although\nUh there was probably mental disabilities and not only the shooter but ah with the bomber this last week that will come up but the Internet is just a a common ground that so many people find your ideas are both positive and negative\nLaw enforcement I think has challenged as or the Internet providers are\nThe social media groups to where is that line drawn in the sand where does free speech step over the line and it becomes a threat against others there should be some type of a violation of law I think that's something we wrestle with every day\nAnd in the meantime I think there are individuals who see hatred posted on the Internet and then many times they want to express themselves or that is what actually may help to feed their own hatred\nIt's there it's something we live with and many times I think that the Internet and free speech is the head of law enforcement and their ability to understand who is the next bomber or shooter or killer that we're going to encounter in this country\nExactly and these crimes have become politicized as you well know there were asking questions about the political rhetoric in this country who and if the bears\nSome responsibility for the violence that we've been saying do you think that wages down the FBI and and the agencies looking into these crimes\nI think that the political rhetoric can be a basis for some other crimes are we seeing\nA ... do you have to be oh here's it obviously police departments here every day but of course the challenges for both citizens and politicians to come to some understanding that words can incite violence and that we're in whatever party one represents\nA if you suggest anywhere from tricking people will do bodies slamming reporters to\nA ... whatever they're suggest you might be\nThere are always individuals' psychologically though to sitting on the edge of the emotional bill waiting for a reason to jump off many times the rhetoric in this country now the last to lose the last ten years for ... reasons for some individual and of course the challenge is\nThat not only do they jump over this\nAbyss themselves but many times they try to drag goes with some\nClint Van Zandt as a former FBI profile or couldn't thanks for your time appreciate it good to be with you and your now is the production of NPR and WVU are in

the first in the country to require mental health education in all public school and one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum\nBecause what you teach in the wrong just might be a

wing kind of online bulletin board he where he pretty much said I'm going in\nSo people there a ... would at least suspected that he was going to go do something there are a lot of questions about that website but in the meantime federal prosecutors say they intend to pursue the death penalty so we will see more of this unfold\nUm and and what about the synagogue will they be closed for a while I mean they've had an extraordinary outpouring of support but what's your sense of what will happen there\nI'm not aware of the synagogues plans specifically but officials yesterday said that they will be processing this crime scene for about a week and that the area the streets around there will be closed during that period\nOnly hearing with W E s a in Pittsburgh thanks so much thank you\nAnd President Trump is putting some of the blame for the attack on the media he tweeted today that there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news\nThose comments come after the mail bomb spree last week after Saturday's mass shooting in Pittsburgh\nAnd now a days before the mid term elections joining us now is NPR lead political political editor Domenico Montanaro to medical welcome hey there Peter the president's first responses to the mass shooting were similar to his first responses to last week's bombing uh incidents and here's how we address the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday\nWe most will rise above the have moved past our divisions and the British are common does today's emerge and it doesn't mean that we can fight hard\nAnd watch on our mind but we have to always remember those elements we have to remember the elements of love and dignity and respect for so many others\nAnd then that same evening at a rally in Illinois he made this turn [noise]\n\n[noise] I really don't down just a little bit is that okay [noise]\nWell you're from out of freedom and much of a [noise] I Know you're well out of feeling you're much\nSo domestic uh we've seen this president make a turn from being presidential to ... over and over again during a national tragedy just walk us through how he's been responding to this latest one well I mean listen to the energy difference between those\nTo uh you know talk so sue soundbites yeah this president when on script and he's given the words in front of him to read how he you know should sound at presidential\nThen he goes and does that but you know listen to how these egged on there by the crowd that's the energy that's what fuels and that's what he thrives in and he understands the difference within himself that\nYou know remember during the campaign he said I can be so presidential I'd be so boring doesn't want to be that guy and that and he's going to do everything possible to sort of fight doing that he has this habit of speaking out of two sides of that his supporters can say look he said the thing you want what else do you what else are you looking for\nI also want to ask you about a theme that's been running through these past few days in it anti Semitic conspiracy theories the mail bomb suspects sent one of his packages to George Soros the billionaire who's regularly a target of hate speech\nThere have been a number of conspiracy theories about Soros including that he's funding the migrant caravan and Central America I'm as we just heard from the last segment the Pittsburgh shooter has echoed this idea he claimed on line that the Jews were responsible for the Caribbean\nWhat do you make of these theories making an appearance of both of these stories and increasingly them in the mainstream political discourse\nWell it's always been something out there and sort of the dark Web than in places you know where people are routinely harassed and it's something that Trump the White House his campaign shouldn't be sensitive to you know whether inadvertently are deliberately during the campaign they ah you know wound up re tweeting white nationalist\nI instead this president doubles down and you know when he feel what they're sensitive to and what she's sensitive to is how the president is treated and perceived and you know they were now pivoting to the straw man I was saying that he is not anti Semitic well that's not really what we're talking about is not about him this is about\nUh how the message is received\nWe're eight days now from the midterms how does all this play into people's minds that head to the ballot box or or does it at all\nWell Democrats are certainly playing up Trump's rhetoric

percent so yeah there is truth that\nThe bulk of the money that goes out of the budget has to do with the safety net programs but the big change in the deficit\nCame because of corporate tax real
