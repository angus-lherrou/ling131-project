{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Agents out there describe for us if you will as a practical matter how this was a matter of fact I think a lot of us who've been down to south Texas you're on your way back and you see a checkpoint this will within the interior of the state uh\nUh for example right\nRight and and and we're familiar with that in Texas not so much in other states that I'm border patrol actually has his own within a hundred miles where they can set up checkpoints and they can actually do roving patrols beyond that hundred miles and\nActually in the course of reporting this story what they told me as they're not really India graphically limited uh their authority to arrest entertain people and the thing that is unique about them is that they were given these powers um after World War two\nTo search detain people just based on reasonable suspicion instead of probable cause which is a higher standard that's under the yeah the constitution to protect people from unlawful searches and seizures so they have a lower\nThreshold Herschel from being able to detain people and the case that I highlight is in the story is really at worst case scenario\nWell let's talk about this particular uh example where I interviewed\nYeah so this one of the U. S. citizen and uh she's actually from New Mexico but she had gone over to ... to visit a friend who had just lost his wife and she was coming back across the border or in El Paso\nAnd waiting for them to swipe her passport and the agents that you know we want you to go through a more like a secondary inspection than another agent brought one of those drug sniffing dogs run\nAnd apparently that agent said that the dog had alerted to her that she might possibly have you know drugs on her or something like that\nSo then they said you know we're gonna have to take you to a secondary inspection inside and it's going to be more intensive so they took her inside and they did like\nA strip search and you know they put it through all this stuff and they found no evidence of contraband or drugs or anything like that but even so they didn't put her in a car and drove over to a hospital in El Paso\nAnd then subjected to her to a series of cavity search is um [noise] a CAT scan an X ray\nAnd uh then they wanted her to give them she ... they wanted her consent to do it or after the fact and they had no warrant and then they said you know if you don't sign the consent form then we're going to believe for all this\nAnd she said well I'm not find you know I didn't get my consent so sure enough she got started getting bill could nine fifty four hundred dollars for all the procedures that they wanted her to pay she ended up at the ACLU and they did do the case and and she actually did end up winning\nWhy is there no pushback considering how many people are caught in this zone\nI think in the past it was overlooked because the thought was well this these are people who are not citizens or it's just the border I think there needs to be a conversation would be nice and Congress about the kind of authorities that they do have and if they should be updated and may be reformed you know\nIt certainly seems likely to be ... conversations the article checkpoint nation by militia do busking

I'm a dozen Turkish and Saudi investigators have entered the U.S Sally consulate in Istanbul right now um and that was as you say the last place that democracy was seen\n'em and they're doing a search of the conflict and they brought along a crime scene investigative a van or they brought that into Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had offered investigators to search the costs with a few days after ... went missing\nThe thinking about a week and a half to get investigators in there and get a search underway I'm In Saudi Arabia may finally allowed it to go ahead it's a way to calm rising tensions between the kingdom and the U.S well on sixty minutes last night the president promised severe punishment of Saudi Arabia is behind to show the ... disappearance and possible death\nBut today he says maybe it's real killers he also said last night on sixty minutes he didn't want to hold a proposed one hundred and ten billion dollar arms sales to Saudi Arabia as punishment some are suggesting is that would hurt American manufacturers and he said everybody in the world\nWants that order he he said this before including Russia and China is that true [noise] [noise] um\nYes just to clarify something you know first of all what analysts say that the arms deal is worth a lot no question but that the one hundred and ten billion dollar figure being bandied around by Trump is really inflated\nIn a lot of the deals are just letters of intent and not actual signed deals\nAnd many of them in fact started during the Obama administration\nBut I think the president is right that Russia and China would be interested in selling weaponry to Saudi Arabia is a very rich country and it's always looking for arms\nBut whether the kingdom itself would want to buy those a U.S arms uh by the Russian or Chinese over by us arms is really another story you know the fact is it's unlikely Saudi Arabia wants to annoy or alienate the U.S is a very important ally to the royal family\nHow is this going over in the region [noise] well ... in\nSaudi Arabia I mean you get in a completely different picture than you are really in the rest of the world that's very much that at the world is against Saudi Arabia that you know basically real killers were involved with that the Saudi royal family had nothing to do with the whole\nIncident um you know and then it getting some of that backing from the United Arab Emirates as well as Bahrain which are very close allies with Saudi Arabia\nBut you know as the rest of the world is looking at this as an international crisis and the disappearance and perhaps murder of democracy has really touched a nerve worldwide\nNow well and as you mentioned that the region is viewing it or at least in Saudi Arabia everything in his past me

just a few days before the summit on breaks it\nThe Irish border remains the key stumbling blocks Northern Ireland is part of the u._k. the republic of Ireland is not so there's concern that there will be a hard border between the two in the u._k. is no longer part of the new\nBorder issues could also affect collaborations between scientific researchers in the u._k. and the new\nJoining instead of talking about that as professor mark ... who is chief executive of UK research and innovation that is a government agency that oversees some nine billion dollars in public funding for research and innovation professor ... welcome to hear now\nThank you ... them to see and how concerned are you about brags it and the impact of brags it on research\nWhat I mean the first thing to say is the research and innovation is a worldwide activity I'm One of the reasons I'm here is that we have many many collaborations with United States but indeed countries around the world\nBut of course Europe is an extraordinary important partner um we have very many scientific an innovation a research innovation partnerships across Europe and those will continue\nBut will it be more difficult for researchers from mainland Europe to work with researchers in the u._k. after Brexit\nWell downstairs shouldn't be uh the government has indicated that the mobility fool the sort of people that are working in recession innovation will remain possible\nBut it is a big a disruptive process and I'm a science and innovation is any part of it it depends on an April deal being done what are your concerns right now my main concerns are about people actually at the end of the day ah UK reception innovation is an extraordinary international\nActivity you go to any university you go to any ... in the u._k. and you will find people from all over the world including very many people from Europe because of course geographic ... pop now\nUm and so a ... it's really important that continues to them because since and United States\nAre you in the United states in part because you want to do more a collaboration with people in the United states especially after ...\nIt's not simply a compensation no uh we're here because that's either the truth is that the U.S is our number one international partner so you know we're building on extremely strong in deep relationships\nThe Nobel Prize in chemistry or had a a British a scientist So Greg went to ...\nTo American scientists working in the same area and in fact the it's the twelfth Nobel Prize for research done in the ... black could have biology since Nineteen fifties I quite extraordinary record\nSo where are the u._k. and the U.S collaborating right now\nIn an enormous number of areas so many scientists of some form buffalo ... collaboration but it's just exactly a year ago but the first ever UK us science and technology agreement was signed\nAnd they're also very important big international projects so are the deep underground neutrino experiment or we are the major international collaborate to own that\nAre working together on understanding what's going on and then talk to come to a basic cope with weights place yeah\nI'm I'm In the office and humanities says if an important collaboration between ops new ministers such come so and the Smithsonian and in fact just yesterday morning I was just a a a meeting of the American Academy of arts and sciences talking about truth trust an expertise\nA serious simple topics at the time when public's are questioning expertise\nUm that challenging a cruise and this is a time when we really need to ... gauge without public's\nWhat's the most exciting thing that you're looking at right now in terms of research that's going on\n... you look across the whole spectrum of for such an extraordinary time to research so uh in the u._k. we've got a extremely strong ... technology is\nAlmost every area you look at is absolute striving and one of the important things one of the things that makes the formation of you ... is the increasing it was set requires multi disciplinary teams you can do a ...\nI've done before but the real challenges to take knowledge in tonight's into public benefits it's a that's what she owed off I'm doing some ... billion tons of yeah comes from the taxpayer\nInsects and needs to see you know hundreds of knowledge that knowledge to undo utilities so the challenge and the opportunity for all of us has to develop new services the new products and you ...\nA big part of innovation obviously is medical innovation and I want to ask you another question there for about a ... there are questions about medicines that that the u._k. will need\nOr if this breakup happens as as people think that it will there's a question about insulin none of it is made in the u._k. a lot of people with diabetes are worried about getting insulin into the u._k. after regs that is that a concern of\nYours um that's that's the trade issue at my job is not put them in the trade issue but I'm what I say is that there's a great deal of mutual interdependence\nUm between all of your amongst all European countries and indeed global supply chains and so you know of course you're looking through the lens one product ... looking at all the things that are made in the u._k. the we export or around the world\nUm but as I say my job is to be responsible for the funding of research and innovation their whole series of questions about trade which are mostly might to me\nThat's a brick wall port who is chief executive of UK

four million dollar debt payment\nIt's an in glorious chapter for the one hundred and twenty five year old retailer who's parking lots and Sunday hours revolutionized consumer culture after World War two fears is expected to close one hundred and forty two stores by the end of the year but says it hopes\nTo keep most of it's profitable ones open just listening to her as a business analyst with CBS News and host of Joe on money her podcast is better off I jump hello so Sears Holdings Corp which also owns Kmart or is probably going to be giving out a lot of pink slips over the coming months how many employees or risk of losing they're losing their jobs\nOr somewhere in the neighborhood of nearly Seventy thousand and and it is unclear what's going to happen remember this was a time when brick and mortar positions for retailers are dwindling\nA an on line ... looking at you Amazon they're going on somewhat of a hiring spree so maybe these folks would go towards the online departments that ... in many of the other retailers that they certainly are paying more up to Fifteen bucks an hour\nBut not all of the Sears stores are going to close\nYeah actually I'm the company had nearly nine hundred stores as of August fourth and that's what we pulled from a recent public filing but as you said at the top and its bankruptcy it said it's going to close a hundred forty two more stores by the end of the year that's after already announcing around a forty six door closures\nAnd it's frankly not clear which locations are going to be closed at this point\nSo a lot of bad news for a lot of people is there anybody who wins from what's going on I don't know I mean I hate to say there are winners that are probably going to make money on\nThis horse because they are going to they have bought distress debt or they are the financial engineers on who\nThe management had really relied to come ... come around and rescue them but I think that that really are yes they're going to be investors who make some money there will be some vultures you can buy liquidated assets at at very you know pennies on the dollar potentially\nBut frankly there are far more losers than winners and none more so than the people who work there and the people who shop there\nDo you see a path forward for Sears will it ever come back\nYou know I recently I guess I Would look and say that retailers have just not had a great track record of emerging from bankruptcy look at Toys R us for example it was forced to liquidate\nLook it's hard to make changes like investing in e commerce or stores or even a company's brand while you're catering to your creditors demands and also more importantly while you are really trying to face this massive competition\nOr we think of so many things when we think of Sears those catalogs are I guess there were also pre cut kit houses which in North Carolina still make up the majority of some towns what Sears going to be remembered for at least the Sears that we know now maybe there will be a series in the future that is known for something else\nYou know I I actually think not only the catalog but all those different ancillary brands and whether it's a lands and being one of them you know these brands really meant a lot to people on and think about this year's was the everything store before Amazon or even the Internet existed\nAnd in it's heyday check this out half of American families had a Sears credit card\nThey employed over five hundred thousand people and they were supposedly responsible forget this two percent of the GDP of the United
