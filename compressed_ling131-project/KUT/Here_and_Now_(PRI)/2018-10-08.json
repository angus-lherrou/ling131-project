{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "You know say a decade they had sort of acquired something like one thousand nine hundred and Ninety stores now which ... thousand stores basically\nI'm nearly tripling its score cash out and um you know uh they had a mission to become sort of the largest retailer you know actresses nationally and\nUm you know if you drive around you can see multiple stores on sometimes more you know the same intersection right sort of like a Starbucks or they had a lot of stores and analysts and outsiders have long said that they sort of that over stored\nUm they thought you know sort of financial help from a buyer a sign off international a South African a retail conglomerate that also sell mattresses and in Africa um but it turned out you know\nLast year that um they were also embroiled in this financial accounting scandals sort of Enron proportions and um that's sort of when the financial troubles of a ... sort of came to light\nYeah I Want to get back to that a point about how many retail stores there are because it's long been almost a me really our own online that you that uh you know what ... what why would any retailer of a product that people typically by every seven to ten years have a store\nEvery few blocks and if you drive around for instance the Texas capital city here they are I mean you literally can't go more than a than a mile or so before you see yet another I mean just Google it and you'll see that but it's it's amazing what what's the what was the thinking\nWell I I think that that question puzzle a lot of outsiders for a long time or you know people were\nNot a conspiracy theory is that they were spouting on line and and people had all these kind of idea that that the reason why I think you know it it comes down to you know he's mattresses south or a very high premium and I think matches from thought that you know they could have a mattress store um\nYou know put maybe one or two sales staff in there\nAnd uh you know if they can sell one or two mattresses ... a month\nThey that you know really um you know break even and turn a profit eventually they saw more I think what happened was that they had acquired a lot of the competitors are over the years and um that put a lot of strain on their business model\nOh so what's mattress for him saying about its next steps they plan to continue in business right\nYes so this is a chapter eleven bankruptcy it's um they're they're looking to tear down the number of stores bankruptcy proceeding will allow them to um get rid of a lot of the reasons that they've signed over the years so you know they they've secured a number of loans to get them through the bankruptcy proceedings which um they said and I\nExpect to take about forty five to sixty days so I'm after that um we'll see what happens I think analysts think that not just from\nAnd it's kind of company ... maybe looking to you know for a buyout\nUm buyers could include private equity firms I'm I've also heard Simmons which is a the nation's largest mattress maker and I'm currently\nA match terms um so you know major supplier they may be interested as well they may be exploring um this option as well but we'll see what happens ah it it's going to be an interesting ride\nAll talk of ... reports on retail for the Houston Chronicle will link to his latest should Texas standard auto orgy Paul thanks so much things happening and you were listening to the Texas standards\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat was done bar has been monitoring what books are talking about on social media and uh I'm thinking maybe Kevin came up once or twice I think you would\nBe correct yes the Saturday afternoon confirmation vote a bread sending Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court a proven very decided a divisive just as we've seen in this whole process\nWith the hearing and lots of folks sounding off on line a divisive late on our Facebook page would expect yes here's one perspective from our Facebook page from Philippa Ballard he calls cabin on one of the greatest legal minds of our generation top of his class at Yale Law school\nWell respected by most everyone in DC into Trump nominated him Phillip says that the media and Democrats ... and his family an apology meanwhile hearing from people with different perspective James ... ... is still hung up on\nWhy ... why this guy why not another conservative judge who isn't damaged goods I still suspect that there is a nefarious reason why they were so committed to this nominee and Ernest tourists as the Supreme Court judge should choose sides and apparently he has\nPicked aside I think referring there to the uh the highly sort of partisan remarks that he made a when he was called back in front of the Senate Judiciary committee talking about The Revenge on behalf of the Clintons and whatnot so\nI uh it's fascinating to think about what are all will fall out from the Kevin ... a company I shouldn't of course he's going he's already been sworn in yeah I Know we found a photo from the White House right Saturday evening out right and I believe he takes he takes his seat on Tuesday a court of course today is a federal holiday so\nHe'll be taking a seat on Tuesday there aren't a whole lot of of red letter cases on the court docket this show\nA nonetheless a lot of court watchers waiting to see what sort of stamp Kevin ... puts on the court\nDefinitely on of course you can't sort of removes the political considerations here and so Tyler ... has an interesting comment he says we've yet to hear the end of this once the adults regained control of the government again he will be removed from office so potentially some\nFolks maybe looking at a some sort of impeachment mechanism or something along the way I have heard something some discussion about that also yeah we've heard like Democrats talk about that whole concept of a court packing right pointing additional justices\nTo sort of brown out that the conservative majority now sort of effect when the last time was we had a court packing scandal must have been the ... dirty it's been awhile\n... less divisive news is fifty

B. U. R. I. Lisa Mullins is here and now a tropical storm Michael is now a hurricane and continues to grow stronger is it approaches the Gulf Coast of Florida forecasters warn Michael could bring major winds heavy rain fall into dangerous storm surge\nJeff Hoffman is director and chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network he's in Gainesville Michael is now forecast to be a category three hurricane prior to landfall in the panhandle\nMaybe as far east as the Big Bend region how soon do you expect landfall\nWell that's the most uncertain part of this forecast unfortunately we've got some model dated that spread quite a bit on the timing of landfall because some data suggests the storm will slow down as it approaches the coast\nOther data suggest it will race inland so it it could make landfall anywhere between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday Afternoon the remember this is going to be a large and dangerous storm it impacts are going to spread hundreds of miles from the center\nEven areas down as far south as Tampa Sarasota could see a significant storm surge in tropical storm conditions from the system beginning as early as a Tuesday evening\nA Michael is the thirteenth named storm now hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season how common is this type of hurricane in October well\nOctober can be a busy month in the tropics were still in what we call the heart of hurricane season there's actually a second peak when you look at historical data sometime around the tenth of October or ... activity ramps up it usually comes from the Caribbean or the Gulf not far out in the Atlantic so this is not unusual we had hurricane Nate this time last year racing into the Gulf\nOr we've had many storms in fact Florida a seat just as many hurricanes and tropical storms in October as they do in September so this is something that a lot of folks think it happens suddenly it did develop quickly and that's the nature of these types of storms in a very warm Caribbean in a very warm Gulf of Mexico or they can develop very quickly and certainly Michael has\nFlorida governor Rick Scott has issued a state of emergency for more than two dozen counties in the state uh he's pressing to prepare now he's saying that families need to make sure they have three days of food and water in any kind of medications that they need just three days sound about right to you how do you make that kind of estimate\nWell that is a that's a safe estimate for inland areas especially but right along the coast I'm concerned that residents in the Florida Panhandle\nHave had a bit of hurricane amnesia even though there's been two storms in the past two years we had Nate side swipe the panhandle we've had several tropical storms in the pan handle the last three years we had her mean back in twenty sixteen hit the Big Bend region\nI'm concerned that residents they are going to prepare based on what happened to them in the last few storms this one is much stronger\nAnd opposes a much more dangerous threat and especially in terms of storm surge\nThat is one of the most vulnerable coastlines and Florida that Big Bend area\nOf Florida there are east of Panama City for a storm surge and this could be significant on the order of the early estimates now the storm surge could be seven to eleven feet in those areas [noise]\nLots of people thinking of going to Florida making plans to go to Florida right around now what's the likelihood that they'll get there anytime in the next couple of days\nWell unless they can hop over the storms of the south Florida that that area near Miami should be largely unaffected but I Would hold\nOut for a few days okay Jeff Hoffman meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network tracking

power of the president\nAlso on business interests in regulation according to the progressive law from the constitutional accountability center the Supreme Court's latest term was the most business friendly in recent memory\nEric Thompson is senior editor at the Atlantic he joins us as he does each Monday from New York Derek the U.S chamber of commerce president called Kevin other right judge for the job after his nomination why do business groups to pour capital\nKevin ... has been an extremely pro business a judge he has ruled against the national labor review board several times citing consistently with employers ever workers he's\nRuled against UPS pollution rules against the Obama administration so called net neutrality rules are it seems that almost every single time there was a case brought before Kavanaugh or he\nFinds a way to side with the employer over the employee and this has been the case then most recently or at the circuit court level where he's been in the D.C court ah but it's also a trend that a lot of court watchers expect him to continue after three\nCourt level will during his confirmation hearing to then judge Kavanaugh dressed and the idea that he is anti regulation he said he's not a skeptic of regulation he is skeptical of illegal regulation that is outside the bounds of laws that are passed by Congress what if some of his past rulings aside from the ones you mentioned been like on the issue of regulation\nSure it looks like a two stories are in one case a trainer at Sea World was killed by a whale\nAnd the DC circuit court found that the world was liable for ignoring specific warnings about this particular animal is particular whale\nKavanaugh descended he said that working with large animals was inherently dangerous it was like stock car racing and therefore SeaWorld shouldn't be liable to be clear that was a defense so he disagreed with the majority at the DC circuit level there's another case where a black Jamaican FBI employee\nSuit his bosses for illegal discrimination\nAnd Kavanaugh said that he was reluctant reluctant excuse me to second guess the FBI's national security decisions so again in both of these cases one at Sea World another death at the FBI very very different institutions but in both cases he\nFound that uh there was a way to protect the employers decision and find a way to rule against ah the employee the employees a suit\nTell us more about his stance on workers on organized labor and workplace protections\nSure well you mentioned the constitutional accountability center or they published a relief thorough documents finding that as the DC circuit court has heard all sorts of appeals ... specifically those involving the ... that's an agency that enforces\nFederal labor laws then in case after case they said quote Kavanaugh has sided with employers against their employees in all these types of cases and so they specifically found I Believe Seventy five particular cases in which he\nFound ways to rule for the employer in against the employees some of those included cases like you know the the the real case and the FBI cases I just mentioned\nAnd it should be said well you know eight inflation is within the broader context it's not as though Kavanaugh is a pro employer justice joining a a a Supreme Court disagrees with him in fact the Roberts Court continues a decades long trend of being a pro corporate court or the last Supreme Court term\nWas ruled that most business friendly and modern memory according to the same institution the constitutional accountability center or to be clear that's it's progressive public interest law firm um but this is clearly a case where the Supreme Court\nAh is which has been consistently drifting towards ... corporate uh rulings a sense of Nineteen seventies will continue that trend in the future\nBring the environment into this uh in the case last year Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion saying the EPA could not require companies to use more environmentally friendly alternatives to refrigerant\nChemicals what more do we know about his take on environmental regulation\n... he's ruled against the EPA or pollution rules pretty consistently a one in the case you mentioned there another where he ruled a vet a upstream polluters shouldn't be held liable\nWell it's interesting because of that clean Power Plan that sent a signal\nOr by the environmental protection agency to reduce emissions and the electricity sector and what that has unleashed is ripple effects that such as the U.S climate alliance which now includes Seventeen us states representing about forty percent of the U.S population that are committed to\nAchieving the federal clean Power Plan and in fact exceeding the targets of the clean federal plan because many of the state to understand that was a pulled back at the federal leadership level we need to have a individual and states and communities such a city stepping up\nPressure thinking thank you Brenda ... is director of climate science for the union of Concerned Scientists in Washington\nChina has detained and is investigating the former president of Interpol among hung way for bribery among disappeared in late September after he traveled to China from ... France were into bullets headquartered Michael Bristol reports from the BBC and Michael among Hong lei disappeared\nLate last month after he sent a cryptic checks to his wife what was in the text\nWas there were two tax actually and this was on the twenty fifth ... Chen or the ... said to eat in Chinese at wait for my telephone call a few minutes later he then sent an ... of what appears to be a ...\nA suggesting to she sent me how his wife so it ... that he was in danger\nWe had nothing until late on Sunday evening and national supervisors committee and she's at a new organization which investigates corruption said they were holding him I and then on Monday the a ministry of public security said they were holding him on suspicion of bribery\nSo these are official Chinese departments that are holding him but they waited a long time before they even made that announcement what's their reason for waiting and what's the reason for holding him\nWell firstly they haven't said well the reason for ... that's usually China they don't feel as though they have to explain things as they might do in a a western country where there's a more formal legal protest which has to be observed\nJust but even for a major international figure like this the head of internal\nWell even for a major figure like this the head of ... he was the president he also was still a vice minister at the ministry of public security soon as the Chinese national you question is an interesting one because you would imagine that it would be difficult for the head of the world's most important international at policing agencies seemed to go missing book\nThat gives you an indication of the nature of the country that China is they\nFeel that they can detaining the law says that they can detain him and detain they date and on what grounds\nWell on suspicion of taking bribes book as in the United states and Western Europe you might have to explain exactly what grounds you have the detainee somebody sitting in Britain you have to go before a judge and explain why he wanted to\nKeep someone in custody you have to go see the evidence you had against him none of that applies in China the law says that can help or a particularly long time and then people held outside the legal framework anyway people sometimes just disappear\nTo be we appear at several months later or even after a longer period of time that I mentioned they were guilty of something or a court case having being ... but anybody living in the west to use to our procedures and it seems very very strange in\nChina it's no is there any evidence\nOr at least evidence that the outside world might respect I'm supporting China's claims that this man is corrupt and was carrying up robbery\nIs just simply no way to assess any evidence which has been leveled against them home way because\nWe don't know exactly what he's being charged with a way he's being held at the moment quite interestingly the ministry of public security issued a statement about a ... home way at on Monday which they explain they were holding him and\nIt's quite a confusing statement but in that they said that the decision to investigate team was wise to act and timely the kind of language suggests they've already made up their minds on whether he's guilty or innocent and\nWhat could happen to him I mean we'll they're likely be a trial is that part of the the usual process there\nWill will be likely a child ... usually comes after the Communist Party the ruling companies thought he conducts ac investigation and uh in my experience long years of covering China it's very rare that somebody is accused of something and then he's not found guilty at the end of that pro says\nMy best guess is that the next we'll have about same age when I'm he's being cool and found guilty of a crime and perhaps submitted to hate and we've got a sentence\nThat the length of the sentence will depend on exactly and the nature of the crime of which we we no way of gauging looming\nMichael there were concerns that a man would make Interpol an extension of the Chinese state or helping to arrest and extradite people\nIs there any evidence that he did that [noise] that was it\nCriticism and that was a consent when he first took over the rules has crashed into the into the polling two thousand sixteen ... know that really hasn't happened strain gee what has happened is that it shouldn't a light on China's\nA legal system by his detention I mean we're talking about um an extraordinary situation in which I'm On Sunday Interpol announced that the president of the organization had resigned and that's all they said\nThat he was missing person as they've just accept you as a nation of ... trying to have explained it came from him if he was came from ... um if it came from the Communist Party
