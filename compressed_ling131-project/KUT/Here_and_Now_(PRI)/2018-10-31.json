B. R. Boston I'm Robyn Young I'm Jeremy ... and if you're\nComing up the final stretch before the midterms is President Trump shifting his focus to just holding under control of the Senate and\nAlso one of the races will be looking at is the unusual competition for governor of Alaska where the income and suddenly jumped out\nThere isn't a lot of precedent for having an incumbent governor name on the ballot\nAnd then not campaigning\nAnd voters around the country will be casting their balance on a myriad of policy questions everything from gerrymandering to nursing staff level but if that's such a good idea [noise]\nShould there be some protections involvement should there be some more non criteria that prevent any sort of manipulating of coming up here in the\nNews is first\nNew for Alaska the only state without either an income or a sales tax a Begich has also talked about he left a permanent funds dividend P.

talking about it's about roughly three thousand dollar PFC neither has been really clear about how they're going to pay for it and the fear is that they're just going to draw down the state's large savings all all that oil wealth\nUm some of it's protected by the state constitution but some of it is and and the more of that money spent\n... could have really rough implications for this state future\nThat's Andrew catch him in the state government and politics reporter at Katy alone in Alaska Public media and again with some people are calling the weirdest and least predictable campaign in the country going into the midterms the governor's race there in Alaska Andrew thank you\nThank you Robin and let's take a like a take a look at the big picture now with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara\nHigh there so you were about to join President Trump and his his campaign pushy is heading to Florida or one of the people have noticed about his schedule a leading up to the midterms at this point is that he seems to be focused mainly on Senate races as he given up on Republicans keeping the house\nI don't think he's given up I think Republicans are engaged in the mad scramble to keep their losses in the house as low as possible but the president has been going to red states states where he's popular he doesn't he isn't campaigning in blue\nDistricts where he's not popular and it just so happens that this year the Senate battleground is a bunch of very red states that he won where his approval rating is very high and they're just happens to be Democratic Senate incumbents are running for reelection in those states so that's where he's focusing\nAnd meanwhile he's been talking as we've been talking about the last twenty four hours or so about ending so called birthright citizenship he said today on Twitter that it will be ended one way or the other even though\nIt is protected by the constitution and constitutional scholars have said it would not be possible for him to ended by executive order we remember that it was a week ago Marta that he was talking about passing a middle class tax cut before the election do these last minute policy appeals work for voters\nBut he thinks they worked for his base don't forget immigration is the number one issue it's the number one culture war issues that he thinks energizes his voters\nThat's what birthright citizenship is for he also ascending fifty two hundred troops to the border even though that caravan is mostly filled with women and kids and it's hundreds of miles away from the U.S border\nBut the ... ten percent tax cut 'em gambit is defensive and he proposed that because the tax cuts that the Republicans already passed is so unpopular and middle class people and the Republicans own internal polls show that people think it was a tax cut for the rich and not for them\nSo appealing to his base but can Republicans do what they want to do in these midterms just with the base\nWell that's what the president's theory is it's always all about the base with him and the problem for a lot of Republicans in these affluent educated suburban district is\nThey need more than the base they need independent voters and they've been struggling a members of Congress in those districts have been struggling [noise] what\nAbout the other big story of this week which is of course the the terrible I'm shooting in Pittsburgh and a following up on the pipe bombs that were sent to some of the ... the president's critics I he's been blaming the media\nFor climate of violence creating our climate of violence on many have been blaming him and his rhetoric what voters thinking as they look at all that\nWell what we have seen is over the last week or two his approval rating has tipped and we saw this before after Charlottesville when he said ... they were good people on both sides um neo Nazis and the counter protesters and the when the president tries\nTo deal with a national tragedy like this\nHe often suffers in the eyes of voters because he doesn't do this very well he doesn't do empathy he doesn't see himself as a moral leader he\nDoesn't see his role as healing his Goto strategy is division and just just to illustrate this he went to Pittsburgh yesterday he visited the synagogue and what he tweeted today he said millennia and and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh the office of the president was shown great respect on a very sad and solemn day\nWe were treated so warmly small protest was not seen by us stage far away the fake news stories were just the opposite disgraceful not a word about the victims or this and unity it was all about him and I think this is why\nI'm he has really has a hard time with voters when he tries to rise to the occasion or doesn't try to rise to the occasion as the case may be\nWhat are the numbers telling you at this point about early voting in turn out\n[noise] what the numbers are telling us about early voting in turn out is that this could be a historic turnout election for mid term we had millennials and young voters are at least based on their early voting turnout reaching perhaps record levels\nDemocrats have been extremely energized this entire cycle but Republicans are energized too I think this is going to be a big big turnout election from mid term and I think that's a really good thing\n... we have five seconds left but I Want to ask you what is the state that you're going to be watching on election night the big race\nFlorida Florida governor's race Florida governor's race is the single most important race for twenty twenty thousand important rates for Donald Trump same with the Ohio governor's race Michigan and Wisconsin those are the races he needs\nThat has Josh Baltic who is project coordinator for the ballot measures project at ballot PT adjust thank you yeah thank you\nAnd what do you think about ballot measures direct democracy let us

... I think has my Jewish family is coming down from New York and my dad's paying for this and he wants to have any gala to Cornell and had to have any ... any played at my wedding and he couldn't sing it said one of my cousins\nGot up there and did it with a band\nBlowout that party was probably the highlight of my entire marriage and three and a half years later when I was going through my divorce I went to Cornell at ... and I said guess jinx do my wedding and now I'm getting a divorce and so he put the spotlight on me and he told everybody what he's done and we had a little party [laughter]\nMy name is around ... and you're listening to K.

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... and if Democrats take back control of the house of representatives next Tuesday one of their priorities will be taking on big pharma so what might happen to drug prices\n... reporter with our partners that staff the health and medicine publication he's with us from Washington I left\nThanks for having me a new report that house minority leader Nancy Pelosi has a plan to tackle drug prices and she has led pharmaceutical companies know about what is it\nYeah we reported yesterday that over the summer Nancy Pelosi walked into the the farm on board room which is a group of essentially of\nVery powerful drug company executives and made this threat essentially that talked about the government's right to in in extreme circumstances strict drug companies of licenses to drugs that make them\nMillions and millions of dollars a it's unlikely that the federal government would use that tool but what's notable as the tone with which Pelosi\nHas been talking to the pharmaceutical lobby in the months before an election that's likely to make her speaker of the house again so a couple of the planks that her party has talked about include\nA allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices which is currently prohibited and another is the installation of a Senate confirmable price gouging enforcer\nIn ... plan someone who would monitor drug companies for price hikes and if it's determined that the price hike is not from a business perspective justifiable the price gouging enforcer would be empowered to fine that company proportional to the price increase and\nGive the money to the national the national institutes of health to use for research\nAnd big pharma is against that what about Republicans President Trump has talked a lot about trying to bring down drug prices would he be on board with this idea or do they have ideas of their own to bring down drug prices\nThe idea of this strange bedfellows alliance between Donald Trump's White house and Nancy Pelosi's house of representatives is is certainly an alarming prospect to the pharmaceutical industry here in DC\nIt's unclear whether Republicans in the house and especially Republicans in the Senate they're likely to keep control of that chamber\nWould go along with any of ... proposals in fact it's it's likely that a lot of the house proposals that Democrats approve could could be dead on arrival in the Senate but if all of a sudden the Trump Administration and Alex days are the health secretary\nAre willing to work with below sea on some of the more consensus proposals all of a sudden it could put a Republican controlled Senate in a bind and it could really put a lot of pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to to beat back a lot of these proposals\nBut it's not likely that the White House for instance would support something as old as as part deen negotiation Trump had talked on the campaign trail before his election that allowing Medicare to negotiate prices appeared to be a no brainer has since backed off that pledge it's something Democrats are really hitting him hard for\nIt is it something you think that people are going to go out to the polls to vote and we know that health care is a big issue in general what about drug prices\nHealthcare is a big issue within it drug prices are a huge issue a lot of the pollsters I've talked to a lot of the folks in state parties around the country say that when they called voters and various legislative districts the high cost of prescription medicines is among the things they want government to address most in most urgently and\nAnother thing to bear in mind is that the Republican tax bill passed last year is not particularly popular and one element within it that really riled up voters is the perception that pharmaceutical companies saved billions of dollars collectively from that tax cut which is true it's not a popular element of that tax bill\nThat has led faster at stat let's thank you thanks very

I don't want you to anything in John country\nYeah he he did immediately come out and and and and stand up and said that would show to the nation where he is but again I see this cherry picking I'll give you a good example Steve King congressman from Ira rightfully is under attack for some of his comments that could be perceived as racist\nThe head of the ... national Republican congressional committee came out and that tax him even though that's a very important race for the majority of the house\nLast night at a debate Senator Joe Donnelly in Indiana came out with comments that could only be seen them perceived as extremely racist yet I have ... anybody on the Denver\nTo let let me let me let me to come in there\nFor a second because I've been reading the story about Joe Donnelly last night and and what he said is our state directors Indian American but he does an amazing job our director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job and you could ever imagine it isn't their race or their religion is incredible person that\nThey are I I I get how you could see that the but there and I want to ask you about that at the same time in the context of everything that President Trump is said calling people animals\nOr you know ... making comments that are that are in in my view I mean I don't know about what do you think\nIt's a I think senator dial it was a little tone deaf with his language and he should be admonished for that\nAt the same time the point of his statement was to give credit an honor to the people who are who he was working with the point of Donald Trump's statements when he talks about the the caravan coming up from the south and sending five thousand troops to the border for something that's not even a crisis\nUh to to do that the point is there still fear in the American public and frankly to stoke racial animus and that is the thing\nThat we cannot ignore so I don't get I don't say Donald Trump is responsible for the attack of a synagogue or for the pipe bombs but now he knows what will cart in ... when he when he sets the tone that he said that everything he has done since then we'll be his responsibility because he knows what can happen with the words and well we just wanna make\nSure that we've noted we and then she was going to look at a Senate race and there are Democrats who are just ending soon distancing themselves from other\nDemocrats and let's take a look at that Missouri Senate race you've got Claire McCaskill up against state attorney General John ...
