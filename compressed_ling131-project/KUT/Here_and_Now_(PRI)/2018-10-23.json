J. J. D. eligible offenses um you know one of the things that it appears that it comes down to is judicial discretion\nSo how are you able to find this out was it did someone flag you that this was happening or were you just doing the numbers and all of a sudden you notice something anomalous\nWell somebody flipped me agreements that was filed against one of the judges and in ... near the top of that grievance there was a reference to racial disparity and treat by that and so I I went\nSearching for data and putting many records requests duty ... probably drove them crazy with that um and you know one thing led to another and I realized it wasn't just the racial\nDisparity there is also you know just fortunate number of kids that were coming out Harris County you have an increased and ... just you know another important point is doubled up over the past four years number of kids coming out of her county\nIt's doubled over the past four years\nWill you know you mentioned that racial component we haven't really touched on that here in this conversation but this too is striking Ninety six percent of those offenders who have been sent to a to a these juvenile prisons effectively our children of color what are some of the factors that seem to be contributing to that\nWell one of the things is that you know the demographics of hers how he thought that definitely plays a part of it um and also obviously it's about\nPolicing and you know where police and that's occurring and you know who is getting charged but also they actually okay on court and there needs to be a decision as to whether the kids going to get probation or a tension or sent to\nU. T. J. J. D. I'm One of the factors that does tend to consider is how much supervision there is it gets kids more likely to be successful on probation if there's adequate parental supervision and this is only the um trickle down effect from last incarceration with adult because with\nChildren of color there's an increase the likelihood that mom or dad might be in prison bus unable to provide supervision\nJerry Blake injure is covering prisons and the death penalty for the Houston Chronicle we're going to have a link to the story the Texas standards ... or juice or you can check it out for yourself Gary thanks again that got me\nAnd you're listening to the Texas standard on K U T Ninety point five great to have you along with us this is the second day of our phone membership campaign I'm Rebecca mcenroe joined this morning\nBy Katie's senior editor Ben Philpott were encouraging you to go on line to make your contribution now to support the great public radio that you depend on and we have a Fifteen hundred dollar matching pledge\nFrom the good folks at ...

interesting because this was in the administration that started off with a real roiling debate between the sort of so called\nGlobal list faction and the nationalist faction um and now I'm even though Steve Bannon is gun who we sort of think of as the original nationalist\nThe in general the people the president is bringing in and surrounding himself with are the people who feed that more got

projects they really rarely do anything smaller but even by Beijing standard this thing has begun now the largest she crossing ever the longest it's a thirty four miles\nConnecting Hong Kong Macau the two Chinese territory or to the mainland city of July trying to kind of argument is going to cut the travel time three hours to thirty minutes\nOf the catches that Hong Kong or as a you know through their taxes nine billion of the twenty billion dollar budget they can't even drive their cars they would need a special permit\nOnly buses and government vehicles can go on the bridge so there are a lot of lawmakers grapes years say this is the big white elephant Beijing sending a symbol to Hong Kong which had the umbrella movement protest a few years back that they are under the increasingly firm grip of the mainland and not to forget\nYou know what is the political significance of linking Hong Kong with it's almost like a biblical cord to the mainland\nThat's exactly how one lawmaker air quality a moat described it to me today and when you're flying in the hall and you see this long bridge and it's really a strike each site just one month ago today they opened up a high speed rail line connecting Hong Kong to one Joe China step by step people here feel like Beijing is physically putting its stamp on this\nCity Mm twenty billion dollars a decade to build a but the government is of course is making the argument that there is an economic boost to be had here is that true\nThey are expecting an influx in mainland Chinese tourists you know on those buses that are going to be allowed to travel on the British and certainly not private cars Hong Kong already has a pretty massive tourism industry fifty six million tourists a per year which is about twenty million more than the u._k. which is much larger country\nSo the retail sector or the service industry could benefit but at what cost to the city itself to things like traffic to the citizens and their quality of life if people already are concerned though when you walk down the sidewalk it's so crowded primarily with mainland tourists that it's difficult to get around some of the more populated areas and the city alliance\nTourist attraction like the the tram that goes up to the peak which gives you an overview of the city that is always you know multiple hours especially during you know busy times of the day so people are fearful that those kinds of things are gonna get worse for the people actually living in Hong Kong is more visitors block you\nHow much does this bolster president she's image we've been reporting so much about China's efforts to undertake these huge infrastructure projects in places like the south China Sea military infrastructure projects or is this a part of that in a way\nI mean China prides itself and completing these massive project and yet those those artificial I was in the south China Sea obviously controversial but that's kind of putting its stamp on territory that it claims even though those claims are rejected by the United states in many countries in here in the region and around the world as far as you know others you know civilian type restructure\n... this is now the sixth largest bridge in the world but the one that is opening Iran on call I guess where the other five largest bridges are they're all located in China\nAnd it just goes to show that you know China wants to prove to the world that it can get things done and the bridge itself it it really is a wonder of engineering they have or and a half times the skill San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge to artificial islands you under the title\nI you know even though it took nine years to build and and you know there was considerable delayed it is an absolutely breathtaking site to look at it to look at a bridge that on a clear day goes as far as I can say wow and were you on it\nWe've been on it or we haven't been able to cross over to the Chinese side as a journalist actually very difficult for me to go into China without a very extensive use a process but for people who live in Hong Kong\nYou'll be able to buy a ticket got on a bus and for significantly less money than what they have a right now there'll be able to travel much more quickly and efficiently wrong Congress we liked it\nMaintained their sense of semi independence and don't want even more Chinese symbol is and what they are already is a well obviously they're concerned you know one lawmaker told me today that\nEven though twenty forty seven is supposed to be the deadline that China allows Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system and way of life without interference\nShe feels and many others feel that this bridge has moved up that twenty four seven date by maybe a decade or two ... which means that for people growing up here in Hong Kong the message is being said very clearly they are part of the mainland and they have to always remember that it's the motherland with a capital M no negotiations no questions asked and certainly no protests\nCNN International correspondent will Ripley speaking with us from Hong Kong about the world's longest the crossing bridge that open today linking Hong Kong

U. T. covering energy and the environment\nAnd he joins us now from Austin most it's good to have you back they\nCity leaders say not only could this water be dangerous to drink but that Austin could actually run out of water altogether how unprecedented as is\nAbsolutely unprecedented they say they've never done a dealt with anything like this is the water utility has been here ah and ah yeah it seems as though like you say we're struggling with two different problems one is water quality and one is water quantity they they need enough water in the system\nJust to keep pressure and to you know for for fire fighting for very central services so while they struggle with all this mud and silt uh they're also worrying about the quantity and the two things are absolutely related\nSo what about that mud insulted came down through the river I mean we you were on this program we were talking about last week's while they were just historic um so the cleanup job to get rid of that mud instilled has got to be pretty big as well\nYeah they they say they've never seen a water like this in the treatment system and if you go down to the river go to our reservoirs and look at it it does look like chocolate milk you know it's just really a dark brown and uh and it almost looks thicker than you know you would normally expect and so that's what they're\nTaking into the water treatment system and that's what they're trying to filter to a level that would be a you know is a good standard for for drinking and that is really difficult it takes a lot longer a and they're not able to filter it especially with the last I heard they're not able to treat\nA the ... the amount of water that Austin typically uses in a day so they're they're looking at the central city reserves drop\nThat was the last word from the water utility\nMight say now we're seeing reports that coffee shops can't serve coffee restaurants are closed how is this affecting affecting businesses in town\nIt it it is kind of wild to see how they look kind of domino effect you I mean naturally yesterday we saw a kind of a rush on bottled water at the supermarkets that seems to have stabilized but yeah you go to a restaurant on my mom's visiting from out of time we went to a restaurant last night no ice for the cocktails right a\nCafes absolutely close to you 'cause you know most of them are not boiling the amount of water they would need to in order to be able to serve the volume that they are they typically serve\nUm and so yeah there's just a lot of a lot of different impacts here\nAnd it's not just restaurants in businesses it's every day people as you know you live in the city you you've got to deal with this will\nDo yeah I mean I think they're they're asking people to conserve and served conserve\nA I give my shower this morning a you know we're we're just we're trying to to lower the amount of water that were taking out of the system because like I said they're concerned about their ability to treat and put it back in and then of course if you are taking water from your top you do need to boil it because they're not able to get\nThe uh uh the amount of kind of the silk to this uh particulate matter out that they'd like to\nAnd just real quick any word when the order will be lifted\nLast I heard it could be up to\nTwo week wow All right most Michele covers energy and the environment for K.

I think I think people forget what it means to really conserve water intense I guess it's very important to conserve water\nBut you know throughout its like water is is not this infinite resource that we're always going to have\nAnd it is very important that we conserve water all the time not only in these moments as emergency so\nYou know shortening your showers and cutting down on the amount of time that you wash your car stop washing your car you know like really like taking those shortcuts I was just talking to them about um my mom grew up during World War two in London and she still to this day\nTurns underwater rented office ladder soaps and then rinse it off\nKnow it's like very very quick you know we're back to the world war two days in a county down or place to go to support K.
