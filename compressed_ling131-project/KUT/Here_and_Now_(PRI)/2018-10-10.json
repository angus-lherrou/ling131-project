to like he had a great sense of humor he was a damn good journalist Amanda\nProfound integrity and courage and I think above all and this is the paradox I think a a man who is a Saturday patriot and Saudi nationals who had profound doubts about\nThe behavior both at home and abroad the current Saudi leadership I Would like to hope that ... mile is still alive the\nIndications even though no one will confirm it publicly and the Turks are obviously aren't very awkward position on this they've had their sovereignty violated and yet at least at the moment they don't seem that they want to pick a major\nFight with the Saudis I'm right now I'm nobody's confirming this it's just all of the media reporting based on Turkish security sources and political sources seemed to suggest that um [noise] ... show gave them to serve premeditated ordered the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nIf this is true it would be incredibly brazen why do you think the Saudis would be willing to take that risk into shoulder all of this international scrutiny just to silence one man\nI mean it's a very good question a message sent to dissidents abroad every journalists to criticize the government Saudi Arabia [noise]\nObviously this is this is was intended perhaps as a warning I mean it it's strange the bonds of credulity to the breaking point that even this Saudi Government which has acted in my judgment repressive Lee at home and I speak as an American\nHere recklessly with respect to American interests in Yemen against cutter that they would still be willing to risk that operation which violated Turkish sovereignty\nAgainst a man who\nHad been living in the United states are writing for the Washington Post and frankly who's criticism of Saudi Arabia\nWas done in the spirit of Saudi patriot in Saudi national is when you read would Jamal had written it was articulated by a man who care deeply about his country but who was worried about the direction that it was taken\nAnd I'm into conceded that some of the ... reforms\nAre of the crown prince largely\nWere were quite positive to me I Would say it's unimaginable but I'm I'm Sorry to admit that it's more every day that this was

regard for principle I again I care most about the United states\nAs an American well here I think there is a serious issue I mean the American minister rations and I worked for half a dozen secretaries of state of both political parties Republicans and Democrats have long in the interests of the United states maintain very close relationships with Saudi Arabia\nAnd let's so let's talk about that um ... fiance wrote an op ed in the Washington Post begging essentially President Trump to do something about this as you just said not only the Trump Administration but other administrations have been loathe to confront the Saudis about human rights abuses I mean what can\nThe Trump Administration do and what do you think they will do\nIn a minimum we need a full accounting of the Saudi role we've touted Saudi Arabia and the senior leaders of this ah of Saudi Arabia's crown prince in particular as a as a reformer\nModern man who and visions of different future for his country and we have leverage President Trump reportedly said the kings saw him on several weeks ago you wouldn't last two weeks but wasn't for the U.S military and I think the threat consequences to the future of the U.S Saudi relationship\nIs really at stake here now does the administration want to go down that road\nThe preliminary indications are the answer is\nIs you know the

Alice what is the storm due to the race\nThis puts a tremendous emphasis on certainly emergency responders but it shows the true leadership of Governor Scott he has been there for residents of Florida to out many crises whether it's manmade or a natural disaster and he is showing\nReal leadership and you have the opportunity to do so as governor ... we have heard from Senator Nelson a with regard to what he is able to do but this shows a Governor Scott and his concern and compassion for the people of Florida I've worked in a savannah and covered hurricanes there as a reporter and ... and\nThe the the urgency that we're hearing from Governor Scott in terms of\nThe time for you to evacuate is over it is now time to bunker down and race for the worst he has serious he means it but at the same time that the people in Florida can know that once this does happen he will be there to provide all of the state wide and federal assistance that he can possibly get his hands on to help the people there and and and then it's a it's a\nSign of a kind of leadership that he has now as governor and the senator\nJim all the other big race in Florida is the governor's race to replace Scott and one of the people running in that race is Andrew Gillum who's a Democrat who happens also to be the mayor\nOf Tallahassee where this storm is going to go I he was criticized for power losses in Tallahassee during hurricane her mean two years ago areas on the weather channel\nMy city was not practice that dealing with a hurricane for about Thirty years prior to hurricane her main uh and so just yesterday we convened a whole range of neighborhood leaders letting them know and charging them with the responsibility of going to check on their most vulnerable\nTo buy what do you think that this storm is doing to this race and the Scott Nelson race\nWell first of all I all the candidates share the same concerned about the residents who are going to be in jeopardy and the middle of this storm is the first priority I'm certain is to make sure those residents were okay\nFor ... for a here's Gillum he's kinda got the same situation as Governor Scott he's got the ability to really show people whose leadership show people the way he's going to manage a crisis and in a very intimate real way people will see him being a leader in the course of this race\nThe dynamic Florida is very interesting because even Democrats who I talked to on the state say you know senator Nelson as having some trouble he's an insider ... Scott is kind of try to come on and\nCenter Nelson is not really doing the same kind of campaign work to go out and get the new Democrats Andrew Gillum as is bringing into the race and try to appeal to them I think the milk and campaign thinks those Democrats will vote for him automatically the people in the ground say not so fast you got to go get them\nSo the both the Scott and the Gillum campaigns have the opportunity to really show their muscle during the storm\nIt's funny because there's so many other issues that these people have been campaigning on all along and now this storm could really change the dynamics of the race house\nCertainly and and Governor Scott when he ran for governor and twenty ten when I worked for him his up he had three priorities it was jobs jobs and jobs and he said that once you said it a thousand times and and that is what he's been able to provide for the people of Florida and and has a good record on that\nBut also what he is as done speaking of natural disasters the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico a lot of those residents did come into Florida and our whether they're taking up residency or they're spending time there Governor Scott has done a tremendous job\nMaking them a welcome providing the resources that they need and that will go a long way to to not just providing for the people there but the Hispanic community that is so critical to that vote in the Senate race so\nSo his ability to to provide for people everyday citizens of Florida but also stepping up to the plate\nNot just with compassion but with the resources necessary in a natural disaster a\nGoes to show what kind of rejected The Crossley ID Guide to me has\nOne more thing to say which is that the the path of the storm um probably is more hurtful to the Scott campaign just because those are more Republican parts of the state\nThat are going to be impacted and those people are those citizens are going to be very preoccupied by that\nI'm also hearing which is very tough to the ... campaign loss of negative ads today on the Gillum campaign which just seems to me it'd be very tone deaf to go after your political opponent with new advertising while so many residents have there or have their lives hanging in the balance\nOkay just in the minute that we have left here sorry Alice let me just get to one other thing because it is important too which is a Mitch McConnell is calling the people who have been protesting about Cavanaugh\nA an angry mob and it it brings us back to the Tea Party which came to power after doing the same kinds of things at town hall meetings in twenty ten during the debate over Obamacare a ... is it the same thing [noise] [noise]\nOh I I Do think it is the same thing and\nNot only that McConnell called of the attacks on a judge Kavanaugh as coming from a mob when they were just people standing outside you know voicing their opinions and and being arrested and people protest\nBut the people inside of a of a political rally shouting lock her up to a political opponent of what the president United States smiled and reaction of that's not a mob\nLet me just say this tea partiers never went into Iraq private restaurants and chase senators out of out of restaurants when they're on their private time and what we're seeing these protesters and the Kavanaugh situation\nChasing out Senator Cruz banging on the
