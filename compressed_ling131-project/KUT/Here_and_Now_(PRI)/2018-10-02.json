I think so so you know this comes amid a lot of political pressure I think Bernie Sanders especially had been had been taking Amazon to task\nFor ah for their wages so Amazon says that they are going to offer these now and this offer this impacts a lot of people in Texas there's warehouses in or around San Antonio San Marcos Dallas Houston and also has a corporate offices in Austin so lots of folks sounding off on this one in Austin Sam says that it's a huge move\nFor them after taking so much for their employees quality of life concerns\nAnd hope that ... says you may have the right choice I'm proud to be your customer a interesting comment here from Zach oh he says I'm via Twitter\nThat he saw another comment said the Amazon is going to go bankrupt now that they've raised their minimum wage for Fifteen dollars an hour L O L L O L yeah because they they did apparently rake in I think some two billion dollars in profits last quarter mhm yeah crazy stuff there yeah I just\nFor clarification I Believe that the floor is currently seven dollars twenty five an hour and that Texas policy\nHas events than double that uh and uh you know one one other interesting aspect of this do I did see some people raising this on Twitter\nThat Amazon outsourced is so much especially derive delivery so I Do wonder uh what it will mean for those employees but we have heard a lot about you know the conditions in those Amazon where outright and stuff I Am not even sure if they are classified as employees you know a lot of times they're contractors ... yeah\nSo a more to come on that for sure but okay as promised another Kavanaugh related term although a slightly different tack hear the term you'd be forty is trending yeah you're talking about the British regularly a purveyor of red red wine that they are yes English regular pop and\nThis was after the New York times reported on a Nineteen eighty five bar fight involving Kavanaugh and some of his buddies which transpired after a you'd be forty concert what had happened\nIs that women he's we're at the bar and one of them sees this some blow sitting over there and that and one of one of his buddies is like Hayes that the guy from you'd be forty I think it is and I think words or exchange and next according to the police report\nAh Brett Kavanaugh throws his drink throw some ice that the guy and a male a ensues knowing that none of the cabinet and that ...

fellow that that is the senior politics editor at NBC thank you thank you\nWell the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded today Arthur Ashe skin of the u._s. ... district of Canada one for their work in the field of laser physics Roger fell ... president of the American Physical Society welcome to hear no\nA great to be here Germany so tell us about this discovery that won the Nobel Prize in physics and sheer\nWell there actually are two discoveries to inventions are asking a who was working at bell laboratories\nHad been thinking about the idea that life could control the motion of small molecules in small particles\nThere had been a previous Nobel Prize for using light to control the motion of of atoms and small things uh end of art a is now being recognized from that so that for his a contribution to that work and I think that's absolutely terrific\nOkay so that's one discovery what's the other\nThe second prize a was a collaboration between a professor and his graduate student between ... ruin Donna Strickland\nA where they came up with the idea that if one wanted to make a very high power laser of laser pulse that had just enormous intensity\nThat there was a clever way of doing that with making the spectrum the color of light and the laser much broader\nAmplifying the life polls in a in a light amplifier and then come pressing it down to something that's incredibly short and they made this invention a wall working at the University of Rochester\nThis invention is now use worldwide for making the world's highest power lasers well\nWhat are the implications give us a sense of how this is going to be put into practice around the world\nWell if we take the first invention here this idea of a light beams and manipulate the motion of small particles\nThat has been used in biological systems to try to understand the tug in the poll of that a biological systems make on a small molecules\nUh so we can understand a little bit more about biology by poking at if you like when white beans\nIn the case of the second invention where we have this very high powered laser\nWe've use lasers such as uh were developed following um ruins Brooklyn's invention for all sorts of\nLooking at fast reactions have fast chemistry how who molecules react when they come in close to one another had as a chemical reaction happened well by using the lasers that ruined Strickland invented we can make short flashes of light like a strobe light\nThat freezes the motion of the molecules and nothing can understand much more about the chemical reaction\nSo if there's a little kid listening to this and they're playing with their laser pointed it might actually be doing serious science right now\nWill they be doing serious science or they could be having cats have a little leave on them for\nA good one of the things that's interesting about this prize this year is that one of the winners is a woman that would be done to Strickland a of Canada this is the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics in fifty five years by the way they've only been to the first one was Marie Curie\nBack in Nineteen oh three [noise]\nYes and the second was ready to go for mayor ah in fact our society the American Physical Society is going to honor her a later this month a at Argonne National laboratory where she did a lot of the work\nThe ... I think the Nobel Committee is increasingly sensitive as is the entire scientific community\nAbout looking very very broadly about who actually contributed to inventions or scientific discoveries when they award these prizes and I think that's a terrific thing and this year I think they got it right\nLast year the Nobel Prize in physics went to three scientists or who helped recognized the detection of gravitational waves are in space this year as you said it's for work using light what does it tell you about the research that's going on physics today\nWell interestingly of course the tool that we use to measure the gravitational wave\nUses lasers as the sensitive element to detect the gravity way so there's some commonality and the two years\nUm one way of looking at it is that the discovery last year was for real scientific discovery whereas the prize this year looks at an invention but I think the important point here is that this invention that's being rewarded this year is actually being used for basic science all over the world\nUh and so this interplay between invention of a tool and the use of it for science you can't really uh find the boundary between those two ideas but we do tend to distinctly a reward one or the other\nIs Roger Dahl Coney the president of the American Physical Society thank you so much for joining us here I mean it's been a pleasure and

workers the move comes on the heels of criticism over how much the trillion dollar company pays its warehouse workers\nAccording to Amazon itself about twenty eight thousand dollars a year\nJoining us now is that legal she MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co hosts of bill she in rural high alley I Jeremy so we ran the numbers on this and a full time employee and an Amazon warehouse making twenty eight thousand dollars a year is getting about Thirteen dollars Fifteen cents an hour so this would go up to Fifteen how big of a deal is\nYes so first of all it's a big deal in illustrating exactly what you came up with when you ran the numbers that Fifteen dollars an hour which sounds extreme to some people is not a lot of money it is it's somewhere close to the poverty level\nUm however there are some Amazon employees making the federal minimum wage is seven and a quarter an hour there part time employees there are a lot of contractors and that's part of the issue so\nThere are some are in fact a number of uh Amazon employees are earning more than Fifteen dollars an hour right now but uh using Fifteen as a base is not just numerically important news possibly more symbolically important because that's the number that people like Bernie Sanders and a lot of progressive that a lot of union groups\nHave been saying is a number that we should use as a minimum it's important to note that while most states have a higher minimum the federal minimum wage right now seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour\nSo you can imagine how badly about that is to get by on\nAnyone when some cities have said we're raising our minimum wage up to Fifteen dollars an hour not not that long ago just in the last few years people said oh that's really going to harm the economy why his Amazon changed its mind\nWell mostly the same reason everybody changes their mind on this thing going all the way back to Henry Ford there's this great legend about how Henry Ford or you know gave his workers five dollars a day so that they could afford to buy cars\nThere's a lot of criticism of whether that's actually true or not um you know you can't use that example for you know a a jet plane company like Boeing they can't pay their employees enough by jets\nUm but it get on one level there's public pressure on the other level it's just expensive to not pay people the right amount of money because there's so much churn and people go work elsewhere and they don't feel any commitment to your company\nAnd it's hard to get workers that becomes a problem so with Amazon like with target like with Wal Mart they all realize that they're in a market in which their wages were either not competitive or not better than others and it was costing them more to have all these workers churn through\nI was reading a quote earlier today from Larry Kudlow the president's economic adviser who was asked about this and he said he doesn't think that this is going to lead to inflation so I thought it was interesting that they would even be thinking about Iran's doing something but there are so big now I guess maybe you do have to think\nYes so when it's Wal Mart what its target when it's Amazon you actually do think about inflation what we've got right now is a situation that in the last year inflation has been greater than wage growth so we finally got wage growth\nA and inflation is higher than that oil prices are going up and if you cause people to have higher wages they'll buy more which will cost product\nTo become more expensive so inflation is a real concern um ... I don't know that a lot of people think it should be used in as an excuse not to pay people more money but uh it is actually a real concern that if people's wages go up but\nNot everybody does and the price of a hamburger and a cup of coffee in a gallon of gas uh all goes up then you create a different problem where people are a little poorer than they were in the first place\nI Would just briefly you think the federal government's going to raise the minimum wage at any point\nA that's a hard battle they they should have to seven and a quarter is completely out of sync with what people need to earn but uh that's not that's not something that's on this current administration's agenda\nKelly Bell she MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent thank you my pleasure and we should note that Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR this is here now [noise]\n\nPresident Trump's celebrates a new free trade deal with Mexico and Canada we don't take it as a privilege is a privilege for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico I'm joking about everybody\nEverybody but what does that mean trade wars continue how frayed may be changing on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise] too and that's where MORNING EDITION weekday mornings from five to ten year I'm Katie\n\nI'm sharing friday the lawyer for mark judge says the FBI has finished interviewing the friend of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Christine Blasey Ford testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary committee that judge was in the room when Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her during their high school years judges denied any wrongdoing and cabinet denies the allegations\nToday the EPA set forth it's cleanup plan for one of the most contaminated bodies of water in the U.S officials will visit the area next metlife stadium in New Jersey the Meadowlands to announce a plan for berries creek\nHas some of the highest levels of mercury and PCBs in the country a ferry bound\nGermany to let ... with about three hundred people on board became stranded in the Baltic Sea today the Danish operator of the ships has its engine failed and smoke pouring from the engine room there are no reports of injuries because his name to hearing now [noise] ooh support comes from Austin granted direct dumped\nIn commercial and residential properties in the Austin area with natural stone sports an ultra compact surfaces for more than a decade info\nAnd show room at Austin granted direct dot com style set in stone\nSupport comes from Austin film festival celebrating its twenty fifth anniversary October twenty fifth to November of parents split over one hundred and eighty films red carpets panels and eight days of networking and parties film passes badges and more at Austin film festival dot com [noise]\nIf you're a signed on for decades the weekly newsletter you'll receive an email friday morning for the most important stories of the week from ... don't be left out and find anything that\nSenator Kay you ...\nDoes he have seen any point five you're listening to here and now I'm Rebecca Mac and by the time\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

signed on Sunday it would prevent Internet companies from slowing down or blocking any Web sites in California in other words it would require that they be neutral not play favorites\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions shot back to California doesn't have the authority to do that and so here we go another confrontation between California and the federal government let's go to our weekly guide to the world of tack because he\nDid he fly for a senior editor of finance and influence at me because I Love that title Hi tatty sure thing how's it going good and last year as we know the SEC roll back the Obama era net neutrality rules on the federal level now California seems to be saying find will make our own\nSessions is saying states don't regulate interstate commerce the feds do you can't do that doesn't have a point\nYou does I mean this is a debate that really goes back as far you know as things like the articles of confederation and the founding of the country right I mean who controls interstate commerce um you know this is also of course one country with one set of federal laws but\nThis is a debate about federalism and about who has the right to you know is this interstate commerce issued than it very clearly is\nYou know up to the federal government but also we've seen just like during the Obama administration and he's all states like Texas kind of fight them tooth and nail here we have California in a Republican administration during the same\n... and and it's about technology obviously\nWe should say Oregon Vermont Washington do have their own net neutrality lost dozens of states are debating having the as the California is a big ... you know when something like emission standards or solar panels other states seem to follow what\nWhen one state has this and they have you know Web sites that are used across the country what happens when one state decides had net neutrality just an impact others states in any way I mean to the cost of orders\nI mean you're totally right on the Internet is is is not a a\nYou know it has no geographic location here I mean part of this though is that you know California is leading a coalition of about twenty\nState attorney generals um we're filing suit or in this case so they were ... you know California is leader here but not this is not a suicide mission by themselves um but you're right I mean California obviously is that the country's biggest state and it's also been the home of liberalism right for a long time in the home of\nA of the modern day you know quote unquote resistance so you could very well see a scenario here where California if successful in federal court\nYou know this could really open the floodgates option that crowd issues but on the ship the broader conversation between the Trump Administration and fifty state houses across\nA you know by the way they did is a already suing California for allowing sanctuary cities and write and write local police don't cooperate with federal immigration officials in turn on the illegal\nImmigrants undocumented immigrants the city said to maintain their local community a reporter with people um and in July California when the first round of that battle in court so\nWe'll see what happens here but meantime as we said I'm at the knees were rolled back a year ago are people feeling any impact from that are people saying how ... you know everything slowing down speeding up\nYeah I haven't noticed anything I don't know I don't know if listeners have I mean ultimately though that this is not just um I think one of the worries from from people in my my point of view is that deal you know the sort of seemed like to listeners that some sort of\nHigh minded debate about the way the Internet a structured but you know a few stream videos on you know Netflix or Hulu and you know this is really gonna affect your\nData experienced the Internet right which obviously we all depend on every single day so I think it's something that people pay attention to this is not just day intellectual debate between you know law professor is about the meaning of the constitution that says something that is going to affect our lives in a very ...\nAgain and then the on the level of technology you know when this was a post on ... pi appointed is chair of the FCC and twenty Seventeen\nArgued about how this would prevent an investment broadband companies can you just briefly and without breaking our heads explain why they are ... pi the FCC and the mistaken do not deny\nWhat net neutrality [noise] yeah they just see this as you know onerous regulation on something it's not needed right I mean\nA pie said at the time and I'm like no quarter you know it would be the Internet is free and open today and will continue to be so under light touch protections right I'm obviously the federal government a conservative ministry Asians always just as looking out for the fact that with too many state with too many regulations\nOr you know it hurts the private sector right and I think especially there's a concern here among broadband providers that California is successful\nYou could have a scenario where you have a patchwork of fifty different net neutrality loss um that obviously it'd be a regulatory minefield for if you've arise in a word for Netflix right um so ultimately\nThis is I think the worry is if if the states or to empower\nThan than the federal government has no ability to control the way the Internet is structured overall and that's not good for consumers yeah let me be the most charitable argument for the for the pie if she sees that they're looking out for consumers 'em and you know a lighter touch regulatory framework is better for them\nWell and ... and this and the state of California saying that no one's looking out for consumers because they're making it so that the consumer approaches the Internet and everything there is on an equal footing and no favoritism Ted as fly for a senior
