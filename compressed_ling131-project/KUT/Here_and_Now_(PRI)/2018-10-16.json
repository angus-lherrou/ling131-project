...\nAnd so it's influencing benefit it's interest in the United states close quote to counter at Mr Pence said we need to move from an Arab constructive engagement do constructive competition decipher that for us if you would\n[noise] well I think what vice president Pence's speech really signifies is um an unwillingness on the part of the administration to continue\nA business as usual with trying to um as you noted earlier the there's been a long time policy of what might be sort of summarized as constructive engagement\nPredicated on the idea that when the United states and trying to work together even when we have differences working together actually advances the interests of both countries are ways that are\nGood for both countries and I think the vice president in his speech essentially signaled in to that mindset and a much more\nAdversarial framing of the relationship in which there is much more of a kind of a zero sum a dynamic at play where if China is gaining we're losing and conversely if the United states is gaining\nA China loses and I think that mindset is now the mindset of this administration and it does represent a very significant departure at least rhetorically and I think to some large degree substantively as well\nFrom a past a U.S approaches to China on both sides with part of ...\nWell no I have to ask because if the past is any indication of vice presidential speech joined U.S policy toward China would be better than ... to anticipate an even calculate Chinese reaction I mean he he surely would have known that the Hudson Institute was in his only audience hear what was he trying to do with his speech\nWell I think the vice president on behalf of the administration and certainly with the full backing of the president without question and indeed vice president Pence sided President Trump repeatedly and his comments\nUm it clearly was sending a signal first and foremost to ah to try them in a sense I think the vice president's speech was really an effort to kind of serve notice to China that we are entering from an American standpoint from the administration standing wins Pacific we have very different kind of error and how we view China\nYou know in recent days there was this incident in which the Chinese naval vessel nearly collided with a U.S destroyer knew this Bradley islands and this is an example of what the vice president has called reckless or a Harris meant of us ships patrolling international waters but we've seen other run ins with a with a U.S or a military planes is well\nHow where do you see this ultimately going are we looking at a new Cold War\nIt depends on what the meaning of Cold War is but I the way I interpret the speech\nAnd the overall approach the administration is not so much that I'm the dynamics on the Chinese cyber Chinese behaviors are much different than what they have been in recent years what is different is the way that the United states administer ration is looking at those behaviors and what is also different\nIs the way that the United states is speaking about those behaviors and we clearly have a president\nWho has a very unconventional style of communication we have an administration that in a sense obviously follows the president's cue as as the leader of our nation and so we have a way of talking about problems that exist to three or four or five years ago or two years ago\nIn a way that's very different than how the United states under either democratic or Republican presidents spoke about the very same problems and so part of it is shown on the rhetorical\nBut also it suggests that there's a kind of a a a ... a a sense that the United states has reached the threshold of its forbearance with respect to\nCertain types of Chinese behaviors that are seen as very problematic from the standpoint of U.S interests\nDavid Firestein is a long time career diplomat specializing in us Chinese relations he's also the executive director

along the ... and it's getting really ugly yeah now the area we're talking about a is west of Austin out in the hill country that's where the major flooding is\nA in mind you there was further excuse me there was flooding further east a late last week along the river near junction that washed away an RV park in killed three people one person's still missing\nToday is flooding at last check of a flood gauge near the town of Leno Leno river was at Seventy nine feet and rising to the second highest crest ever recorded or for that river this morning people on Leno county live within a quarter mile of the river were asked to evacuate\nAbout nine thirty or so this morning the river swept away the F them twenty nine hundred bridge near king's land you can see the the videos on Twitter I think you were just looking at some moment ago uh it it shows the bridge collapsing and the pieces of it floating downstream it's remarkable staff yeah\nI Know you you mentioned I think it's our our uh twenty nine hundred in king's when that's at least that's what the the Austin American statesman is reporting a or just to be clear but it's so we don't ... their\nUh apparently the Austin fire department this according to some terrific reporting by the states when the Austin fire department is sent a boat with seven people and to helicopter rescue personnel as part of Texas task force wanting to help with rescue so\nSeveral uh yeah several local first responders have been dispatched or you know emergency rescue teams like the ones you just mentioned a dangerous situation to be shared although fortunately no reports this fire of anyone being injured or killed\nThe reason for this flooding illustrated in a tweet by the Austin San Antonio National Weather service that says here's an estimated rainfall graphics in the past few days or a near record flooding of Atlanta river Atlanta can be contributed to an estimated eight to ten inches in the past forty eight hours over the river basin\nObviously the advice from the experts is to seek higher ground if you're near the river and if you're not near it keep it that way\nOn Twitter Robin he also counsels if you're on the Leno marble falls flood area please check on disabled neighbors\nThey may need help getting to evacuation shelters please help them get out sooner rather than later when they may not be able to him

Pakistan as a result has had to have action points in ministries and create a government commission where do you want to see happen because of your lawsuit\nIf we win this lawsuit what we want is anyone there to be um to for the government to put climate recovery plan into place\nAnd even if that doesn't happen or and they keep on fighting all the way through and tried to file again\nNow judges on the Supreme Court has said that the claim that made in your lawsuit\nThat the government is violating your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness by not doing more to the climate change is broad and leaves a lot of room for differences of opinion we heard from the president elect intact let's listen to the president again from his sixty minutes interview talking again about climate change\nThey say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just said\nWith Michael says that they say they say that in the end but what about scientists who say it's worse than ever\nA you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nThere is a difference of opinion right there he thinks it's political if this goes all the way to the Supreme Court are you worried that particular Trump appointed judges will allow room for opinion and not go on science\nI'm I'm honestly not worried because we have lots of scientific facts\nAnd scientists that said things that prove our case I so I'm not really worried because it's pretty hard to fight science [laughter]\nListen to one of your other fellow plant is this is a Thirteen year old Avery McCray and ... why she decided to join the suit I\nA constitutional right to a stable climate\nI Know that one of the government jobs just to make sure that the future plan it will be hospitable for generations to come\nI Know that I Can't though but I Know that I had a voice [laughter]\nLook that's very admirable um but some people say well maybe these are kids being used and when I ask you about that you were only eight years old when you became part of the lawsuit\nDo you worry about people saying that you were being used\nOh no not at all because actually ... how the way I got involved with this lawsuit with Mr at my church and he talked much about this last year and she knew\nLots of research on our soldiers trust and the lawsuit to make sure they had a legitimate case and when she asked me I said yes I really want to be part of this lawsuit because I'm worried about my environment and not being able to live on this barrier island when\nI'm older because I Want to live on this barrier island and be a marine biologist\nAnd so I don't really feel use that all I feel grateful to be part of the lawsuit Levi thank you so much [noise]\nAnd again we'll follow the story that lawsuit goes to trial next month is here now\n[noise]\n\n\nAs you said there's only one rocket man this is here now\n\nTo point comes from our hands made service locally around providing cleaning services but the home in office now offering green cleaning details that four seven nine Seventy nine Seventy eight or more hands dot com\nSupport comes from Austin water there is a grease blob wreaking havoc in Austin causing clog the banks and backed up sewers residents can help by not poor and cooking oil increasing the sink instead board and it can feel it in a plastic bag and then put it in the trash\nWhen I moved to Austin I was working in a Mexican restaurant and there was a small room and the very front where a few people could sit in mostly a lot of people would stand there when we got really busy then one day it's really really crowded\nI had a big group of friends sitting at\nTable in a small ranch\nWalking to the bar with a trade for a can\nBeer and margarita and then there's this woman standing there in a man's sees me and she had her head back to the train my margarita\nSkillfully I lifted it out very quickly say she meant that and let's get right into ceiling fan\nCats so margarita\nBeer went all over the place all over people\nMy friends and mediate Laith stood up and started to applied and then my boss\nHe had to buy a lot of meals that night [noise] my name is safety brake on you're listening to have the\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and math works creators of Matt lab and sent me a link software for technical computing and model based designed math\nWorks accelerating the pace of discovery in engineering and science learn more at math works dot com and landmark college serving students who learn differently with faculty specializing in L.

co founder Paul Allen died yesterday in Seattle at age sixty five of complications from non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nJoining us now to talk about Paul Allen is Todd bishop he's co founder and editor of the choir and he is in Seattle Hi Todd [noise] the morning so Bill Gates said personal computing would not have existed without Paul Allen is that true\nCertainly there is a case to be made perhaps someone else would have come along and brought the PC revolution into the mainstream but Paul Allen played a pivotal role he convinced Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard and create the first basic program for the altar eighty eight\nHundred and that was really viewed by many as the first personal computer so as we are all now walking around with computers in our pocket and I think we can trace that lineage back to that moment\nWell how is he being remembered today what are people saying about his legacy Paul Allen\nHad a second to act after Microsoft so she is being remembered in two ways first for that influence that we just discuss but second for his massive an eclectic some might say random\nInterests and pursuits he was all over the map of both literally and figuratively here in Seattle and with his various projects everything from owning the Seattle Seahawks to the Portland TrailBlazers to creating the experience music project now known as ... pop here in Seattle\nYou look around he basically created the neighborhood that became Amazon's first headquarters here\nTransformed so much here in the city and I think people here in Seattle at least are remembering that legacy today\nIf you walk around Seattle and ask people whose pile and there'll be able to tell you the answer\nThey will but it's interesting because nationally I don't think that's true certainly if you ask who the founder of Microsoft was people will say bilking right and I think that speaks to Paul Allen's privacy he was a very private person\n[noise] tell us about his early life did people know that he would be I guess you would say a genius\nIn some ways he certainly showed signs of it very early on that said he was not your typical nerd he was interested in sports and music and of course science fiction and it was really the formative years of lakeside schools the private school here in Seattle where he met Bill Gates and they started to learn to program\nThey went to the University of Washington campus late at night famously got kicked out of a lot of the labs are there\nAnd ultimately you Paul Allen a basically convinced the gates to start Microsoft is that then was the time back in Nineteen Seventy five\nAnd yet their relationship was not always great I was watching sixty minutes a special about Paul Allen and most of it is about his rocky relationship with Bill gates\n[noise] that's true and when Paul Allen left to Microsoft in Nineteen eighty three she had a contract is his first case of cancer and ultimately beat that when you had Hodgkin's lymphoma and at the time he\nReported later in his biography idea man that Bill Gates and Steve bomber who became Microsoft ... they were trying to basically squeeze Paul Allen out of his shares in the company and certainly at that moment and elsewhere in the company's history there were divides between the two founders what was the problem\nYou know I think that these were two very driven people and certainly Bill Gates at the time and a subsequent to Paul Allen's departure was building an empire and I think Paul Allen his personality was a little bit more\nThoughtful and already thinking about philanthropies and his impact on the world especially having spoken with him about this I Know that\nThat first cancer diagnosis was extremely formative for him it made him reassess his life and think about the broader impact that he would have long term and I don't think Bill Gates was quite there at that point yet\nBut in recent days I mean we see Bill Gates statement about Paul Allen he's being very nice about it today\nCertainly is and there have been reports since the release of idea man in twenty eleven that the two have repaired their relationship I can tell you at the time in two thousand eleven there was definitely a divide between them over\nMany of the things that Paul Allen wrote a book but reports that we started that they've conducted since then and appear to have mended their relationship\nYou mentioned that we've all got a computer in our pocket these days what Paul Allen sick of technology today\nHe was extremely optimistic in fact one of the many things that she created in Seattle was an Institute called the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence to in addition to the Allen Institute for brain science which is actually really fascinating you had both artificial and be organic elements\nOf that kind of processing but he was extremely optimistic investing in all sorts of\nTechnologies startups new kinds of Institute and commercial space venture called strata launch\nPlans to watch rockets into the stratosphere and beyond from what will be the world's largest airplane so this was a man whose ambition and hope for the future clearly persisted until the end of his wife\nJust finally a thought about him you interviewed him many times\nYes I've interviewed at least twice in the privacy was remarkable I interviewed him at town hall or a large venue here in Seattle in two thousand and Lebanon I remember after meeting and backstage we had to walk up to the stage and there was not a facility to do it\nIn a way that she could navigate by going back so we have to sort of walk up the side of the crowd and he was extremely nervous about interacting with the public and yet he was also extremely candid\nAnd forthcoming on stage at that same
