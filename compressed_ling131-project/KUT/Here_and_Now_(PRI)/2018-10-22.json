{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "In the ruling is a real indication for the plaintiff and and an important victory for all kids in Texas foster care so three judges\nThe Fifth Circuit panel all appointed by Republican presidents by the way I found a quote substantial risk of harm to them more than ten thousand kids in Texas foster care from\nCaseworkers having too high caseloads which we've heard over the years and years poor state monitoring of foster care placements and the failure of Texas leaders now and and over decades to address the long documented and well known\nSafety concerns the words that stood out to me were deliberately indifferent to the threat of a threat to children's welfare but what then if if there is this indifference what then changes as a result of this order\n[noise] well let's step back for a second and remember who the plaintiffs in this case so the plaintiffs represented kids who were removed from their parents and placed in Texas foster care and and generally had been in foster care for over a year and hadn't been adopted and\nWhat we think should happen as these kids' lives should get better and what the court found as you mentioned is that lives have too many kids in Texas foster care get worse and that the state essentially knew the risks of harm and and ignored them for decades\nBut I guess what I'm asking is what changes because of this order as I understand it has invalidate it some of the reforms there were ordered by the lower court judge and that would have required and increase for instance in the number of foster homes\nWell Texas is going to have to move forward on two tracks as a result of the court case first based on that decision the state leaders will need to allocate more funding to hire more CPS case workers\nAnd reduce caseloads they are going to have to improve oversight of the facilities that care for that the larger groups of kids um and hire more staff to investigate claims of abuse and they're going to have to improve the state's record keeping and data system which the court frankly found to be a total mess\nOr do you have a first I suppose we should robot for just a moment because there's always the potential but the state could appeal this ruling have you heard me any word from the attorney general's office here\nI I have not seen any word from the attorney general's office and I I suspect that the state will ultimately move forward with a lower court decision and and even where the courts deferred you know where they're where the the appellate court invalidated the prescriptions of the lower court\nIt's pretty clear the evidence was very a damning in terms of what a kids had suffered in care so I suspect legislators and the state will move forward also with some of the issues that may not be constitutional violations but nonetheless are really important and these include\nReducing the number of kids in sort of group facilities and prioritizing more family like settings where kids do better\nUm and ensuring that kid transitioning out of care have the skills and supports they need to succeed once they're on their own and in both of those areas the state has actually been making progress over time and so I suspect we'll can continue to see important changes in the law\n[noise] Stephanie Ruben a CEO four Texans care for children that's a nonpartisan advocacy group based in Austin ms Rubin thanks so much for taking a few minutes out to talk with us on the Texas ...\nYeah I think you're doing it and you were listening to the Texas standards\nSupport comes from tourists academy who knows puppy love often comes with a few less than lovable behaviors stores is here to help with training boarding a daycare and five convenient locations learn more tourists academy dot com\nYou are listening to the Texas standard on K U T Ninety point five good morning Austin water has issued a citywide boil water notice for all customers as the utility works to stabilize the water treatment system customers are asked to boil water for drinking cooking ice or water for pets\nTo a vigorous boil for about three minutes before consuming water is okay to use for showering washing hands and doing laundry dishes should be washed in hot soapy water and rinsed in boiling water bottled water or boiled water should be used for baby formula\nKeeping you up to date on what's going on in Austin around central Texas every day here on K.

polls on November ... last week former President Obama put out this video to convince them that their vote matters\n[noise] because like people who make or criminal justice system and your student loans wizard or forward and by the way you wouldn't let your grandparents fix your play less how would you let them stick your representative who's going to turn your future\nBut we'll young people listening just sixteen percent of eligible voters under thirty cast the ballot in the twenty fourteen midterms according to the U.S elections project it was the lowest turnout rate in more than Thirty years some experts say the solution is better civics education\nBowling teaches civics at Lincoln high school in Tacoma, Washington Nathan welcome thank you at the risk of sounding like an old man why don't young people vote\nWell I think it's kind of a two sided problem on one side people turned out to vote when they're something either to gain or something to lose\nAnd politics in America today doesn't have a lot to offer young people right now\nOn the other side of the equation or you have a situation where states that no the young people tend to be liberal voters\nAre actually making it harder for them to vote so I think about like Iowa made it impossible for college students who were in Iowa to vote 'em as Iowa residents instead made them both for their home states and so it's a kind of two sided thing we're not offering students and young people a lot politically and then we're making it more difficult for them to vote in many states\nAnd we're also it seems not doing much for them in school only nine states and the district of Columbia require civics education and public high schools do you think that's part of the problem\nBut it's absolutely part of the problem I'll say that a lot of this is driven by the end some testing in schools and so essentially a lot of civics classes and pushed aside in order to offer students um additional support in math and reading and not that math and reading are important but our civics our democracy matters a lot that\nThere is a new survey out this month by the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation has some amazing statistic says only a third of Americans surveyed would pass the U.S citizenship test and these are basic questions\nOr like a which of these states borders Canada for instance um but there's also an age gap people who are sixty five in older they're the ones with the highest scores why do you think that is\nI think that civics is kind of like language so like I have traveled in Latin America and learn Spanish several times um as I don't use my Spanish my Spanish still did their skills to share it\nAnd I think so because the same way if you learn civics of high school and an art engaged politically of your muscles atrophy or older folks have more to risk in every election there's a reason why they turn out to vote like basically Medicare Medicaid and Social Security are on the ballot and every election and they know that and they show up\nThere are celebrities who are paying attention to this we heard from a former President Obama trying to get people out to vote in November but here is Taylor Swift or the American Music Awards earlier this month thank you so much for the\nWar and and every single word given out and I\nWere voted on by the people you know what\nSo this is worth noting Taylor Swift Instagram post a with a similar theme urging her fans to vote for Democrats in Tennessee it's single handedly caused the surge in online voter registrations across the country the singer kid rock has done similar get out the vote campaigns for Republicans\nBut my question is is this the new norm\nIn American politics that in order to get people interested in voting that that a celebrity needs to come out and and push them to do it\nWell I I Hope not but honestly like registering to vote is only half the battle you also have to go to the polls\nSo Oregon has gotten rid of voter registration there's automatically registered to vote and here in Washington state you can register online like via Facebook and then we've all a hundred percent by mail and for me when I'm Talking to my students like I'd be rate them like we vote by mail there's no excuse and so for me in my classroom like we vote shame and my students don't like the the celebrities\nOutta that they don't know how are they responding to tailor Swiss a push to get voters out I I work at a majority brown low income high school and they're not related to us with honestly not not that there was no beyond say different story at my school swift is not the business or to take me inside your classroom what are you teaching the kids that gets them engaged with civics\nUp one aspect of politics I think that we do a injustice with as we've paid too much attention to national politics\nAnd to the presidency and so we spend a lot of my time a lot on my classroom talking about the importance of state government and all the things the government can do and like all the powers that come to the tenth amendment\nAnd one of the things my students walk on to my classroom understanding each year is is that Congress actually has far more power than most Americans think they do and essentially everything that Donald Trump is doing right now if you like it then you should maintain Republican Congress\nAnd if you dislike it you should try to overturn Congress\nI was thinking about um the Parkland high school students in Florida and the movement that they got behind after the shooting at their school or that would suggest to me that not all high school students or apathetic about this country that they live in do you think that for the most part\nKids are engaged and they do care but for some reason they're just not going out and voting\nAbsolutely I think this generation that it's coming out today is tremendously engaged in politics and cares\nAbout what's happening I think they're also very skeptical if not cynical about our national politics\nAnd with their part one example you bring up I think that's actually demonstrative of what I was talking about earlier about state politics\nOr the national conversation about gun control policy is basically dead and it doesn't matter what happens there'll be a national movement there is room for movement at the state level and if you look at the Parkland shooting a those kids went to the floor to capital of the national capital and so refocusing some of the energy on a state politics\nI think there's a way to re engage students into politics\nThat's Nathan bowling in high school government teacher at Lincoln high school in Tacoma, Washington and host of the nerves farmer\nPodcast Nathan thanks for speaking with us

what he was not in was excessive behavior and so he was critical where he thought a A N BS in particular or had gone across the line but he was a supporter and\nClearly if the evidence suggests he was targeted the Wilson Center is broken up about it I mean there are people here who really will more than this man and as the president CEO here I didn't know him but I certainly embraced the value she said for\nJane Harman president of the Wilson Center always good to talk to you thank you thanking Jeremy\nAnd let's get the latest now on that group of several thousand migrants that has made its way from Central America into Mexico this morning President Trump tweeted that he would start cutting off or reducing aid to Guatemala\nHonduras and El Salvador for not stopping the migrants joining us now is Alan Gomez he's immigration reporter for USA Today and Alan what's the latest where are these migrants now and what conditions or the fish and\nBirds have crossed into Mexico they're very very southern Mexico right now so they still have a very long way before they reached the southern us border um but the conditions of during right now are very difficult um there was a mess tomatoes five thousand of them do a ...\nStarted off as a pretty small curve him starting in Honduras but just people have been a jumping on board as they've gone from country to country and the difficulty now is a\nGroups are offering to help them but the red cross was on there but a lot of people in the curve and are worried about leaving the caravan for anything um so they're all trying to stick together which makes it hard to find anywhere for them to stay so they're the ... some of them have ... they're covering themselves up and\nI'm overnight a vote for the most part they're just kind of try to band together and go in for trying to find places\nNow we've seen these caravans before earlier this year in fact but why is this one this large is it spontaneous or they're you know people behind the scenes are organizing this\n[noise] ah I think it's a bit of both it definitely start out these these caravans they've done these for years uh quite frankly because\nWhen you're making that long Journey Through Central America it can be an incredibly dangerous thing to do um do you get attacked by people along the way I'm I've talked to so many of these migrants who've been through these who told me horror stories of\nRapes of assaults of robberies and so they started these caravan several years ago as a way to protect themselves [noise]\nUm so it it was planned to a degree but the size\nOf this is definitely been a bit more spontaneous because um they see the reports of it they say hey this was my chance and they'll run over and then joined the group\nNow President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on countries like Mexico to do something about this to stop them as they move north clearly government officials from Mexico haven't been able to do that yet and they've been trying\n[noise] there's there's been different levels of\nEffort let's say I'm a Central American nations Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador um they tried to kind of slow them down a little bit but Mexico now all the focus goes to them down\nSo right now Mexico's in a very difficult position they're getting a lot of heat from the people with in Mexico and Central America to allow these folks to pass but at the same time when you have President Trump\nI'm kind of hovering over you making these threats threatening to send the military to the border threatening to seal the U.S border which would be economically disastrous for Mexico it's a really tough position for them and they're trying to walk that line\nAnd it does seem like President Trump is trying to in a way use this to his advantage he's telling his Twitter followers that there are criminals and unknown middle Easterners mixed into this group and of course we don't really know if there's any basis in fact for a claim like that but\nDo you think Democrats should be nervous about this caravan heading north just about two weeks before the election when the president is trying to use it to fire up his base\n[noise] when you look at the political aspect of this yes this is\nThis group relieve the timing of it has been a difficult because it's injected this issue so quickly into the midterms I'm President Trump has not been shy at all he's talking about it all the time Republicans like I can tell you I've been hearing from watching the races are\nIn in the middle of America They're talking about this Honduran caravan um\nThere are accusations that democratic operatives that George Soros was behind all this that they're paying for these for these carbon people but you know I've also talked to some folks who say actually this is it might as well have been paid for by the Republican Party because the idea of showing these images of these folks marching\nTowards the United states as they put it in trying to invade the United states it's been on a constant loop on all sorts of conservative media um it's being used in your ... congressional district debates all over the country in the last few weeks um and so this is something that plays into their hands that\nSaid Allen how do you see this playing out if and when thousands of people do arrive at the U.S Mexico border\nWell\nWe'll see a lot of what's been going on where they'll try to get in it and then it becomes a question of how quickly the U.S can processes asylum claims [noise] um and and what the resolution of those cases will be\n... will be watching and civil Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today\nAlan thanks for your time thank you this is here in [noise]\nOoh\nYou are listening to hearing now in K U T Ninety
