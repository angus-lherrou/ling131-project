presented by the author's end quote\nThe U.S continues to lead the world in greenhouse gas reductions\nHaving reduce our emissions by fourteen percent since two thousand five professor what's your response to that well that's not world\nLeading that was a a\nStep in the right direction although that was primarily driven by market forces almost exclusively by the declining costs of renewables and natural gas and so a power companies are switching to those\nEnergy sources rather than coal and closing down old coal fired power plants are the EPA also\nTalked about in response to the report talked about how the U.S supports\nThe use of coal as a fuel and supports the development of clean coal technologies that they could then export to other countries but that I Would say completely fails to recognize the urgency of the transition that's described in the report which says we really have to get rid\nAbout Seventy percent of our coal by twenty thirty with the rest going away by the middle of the century and so we're not talking about having some new technology decades down the law and we're talking about dealing with coal starting now dealing with it in the twenty twenties\nHow could it be dealt with in a way that would appeal to the markets appealed to President Trump given that he campaigned on bringing back coal jobs in as you said talks about clean coal we're carbon emissions are\nCaptured what's wrong with that picture\nWell what's wrong with that is we don't really have the technology to do that at scale for reasonable cost and so the reason that we are transitioning away from coal is because the others are\nOther fuels are already cheaper and adding carbon capture and sequestration technology to coal fired power plants would make them even less economically competitive so it's inconsistent\nWith the kind of transformation we really need which the report describes as cold going down by about Seventy to eighty percent by twenty thirty\nAnd renewal bulls becoming half to two thirds of our energy production by again by twenty thirty so we're expanding renewables but not nearly at that pace with the exception of a couple of states like Hawaii in California that are on track for that\nAnd you're saying that ah that would be made up I only by the federal government that the federal government in other words the only one in a position to make that kind of difference\nWell it's not only the federal government um it's also consumers one of the things we talk about is reducing consumption of red meat because cattle take an enormous amount of land that leads to deforestation both for grazing land for the cattle and for growing crops to feed\nThe cattle um if we eat less red meat we can reduce the foot prints of methane and carbon dioxide related to cattle by a large amount but we're not talking about going vegetarian what\nWe're talking about is going to the world Health Organization's dietary recommendations in the first place because most people in the west eat too much meat\nOr the more meat than it is good for them so we're really talking about consumers taking actions using more biking and walking and mass transit instead of driving their car choosing energy efficient appliances we really have to all be in this together to make it work [noise]\nI Wonder what it's like for you um is one of the authors of this report to clearly put a lot of time into it um she arrived back in the United states after the release of the report in South Korea\nAnd here really almost zero response from Washington\nWell unfortunately that's not a surprise these days um Washington is is really\nA enamored of the fossil fuel industry and that there there are many that seemed to value the short term profits of fossil fuel companies an automotive companies\nAbove the both short term and long term welfare of the American population you know getting rid of coal is a perfect example it sends\nHundreds of thousands of kids or miss\nSchool because of asthma induced by pollution from coal fired power plants people die from respiratory and cardiovascular disease from coal fired power plants and we have cheaper sources of electricity so there's no reason whatsoever to keep using coal when we have better alternatives and we know that coal is extraordinarily damaging\nAnd yet the administration is moving in the exact opposite direction from what makes sense for the people writ large and instead it's what makes sense for a small group of of coal companies\nSo for a call to action for Washington for the EPA for the White House if it could do one thing now what would you want it to be\nIf Washington could just do one thing the thing would be to put a price on pollution\nThat really reflects the true cost and so that's the costs that comes from paying for disaster recovery after climate related disasters it's the public health burden from increased heat wave from climate from respiratory and cardiovascular disease\nAnd then we see that the real cost of using coal as a fuel for example is several times what the market current ...\nReflects that it's in our best interest when taking a broad view to pay a little bit more for electricity and or vehicles that are more efficient because in the long run we come out far ahead [noise]\nThank you prevent intrusion del of Duke University he's one of the

international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\n\nThis this year and now Facebook has launched a new video chat device for your home the high definition screen known as portal has built in microphones and a camera that can follow your movements around the room\nIt also has a lot of people asking a pretty basic question why should I trust Facebook with a device like that after the company has struggled to contain controversies over personal data and privacy let's go to our weekly guide to the world of tech Recode\nWagner senior editor of social media at Recode Kurd welcome\nHey thank you so what is portal\nA portal is Facebook's attempt to kind of getting into this in home device market that we've seen\nA Amazon do with the echo and with Alexa and what we've seen Google did with Google Home uh it's kind of their version of that and the idea would be\nThat you would put it in your living room or maybe in her kitchen and it comes with the big screen so the kind of differentiate or for Facebook is that they want people to make video calls with this device so wouldn't just be something you talk to but actually something\nThat you would use to uh you know call on the video to family or friends\nAnd Amazon Alexa is actually built into the system right\nCorrect yes I I kind of thought that Facebook might come out with its own assistant or and then it very well could at some point but to start or it's going to be using Amazon's a Alexa technology as kind of the built in a assistant for the device\nWhat's motivating a company like Facebook to get into a space like this I mean what's their pitch to someone like you and me that says here's why you should have this well\nI think the company pitch 'em you know at for for marketing purposes is going to be\nHey we're we're Facebook were all about connecting people connecting the world uh they're probably loved ones that you have who live in different states are different countries and there's no better way to you know stay connected than a video call right so that is the that's the marketing spin that you're going to get from Facebook I think on the business side\nUm there's this feeling that all these tech companies again our our building these devices this is probably the way that people are going to uh you know shop someday um they're going to watch television they're going to basically run their daily life around the house\nBy using these devices and these assistance and I think Facebook is you know probably terrified about being left out of that conversation and watching Amazon apple and Google dominate that market so I think for my business standpoint but if you look long term I kind of owning a place inside people's homes I think that's a pretty valuable place for Facebook to try and be\nAnd let's look let's bring in the elephant in this room just about two weeks ago we had the latest privacy scandal fifty million Facebook accounts were hacked due to problems in Facebook's code of course there was the Cambridge Analytica story from earlier this year\n[noise] why should people trust Facebook inside their homes I mean there's this very intimate moments potentially\nVery and the idea of not just having a microphone in there but also a camera right something that uh you know could theoretically if it gets turned on at the wrong time unexpectedly it's all it's all of a sudden recording your house and not just an audio but with video [noise]\nUm I think that's the ultimate question and that's the question I basically posed when I wrote about the device on Monday was\nIs there a good reason to trust Facebook at this point and I think\nUh you know I I don't think the people there are malicious but at the same time there have been so many blunders in the last twelve months\nThat there's people are going to have to ask themselves is the benefit of having this device are worth the risk of of potentially you know having some type of security issue or a privacy issue\nI think that a lot of people are going to be turned off by the fact that this is coming from Facebook especially right now [laughter] um but there are a lot of people as we've learned that just you know don't necessarily care as much about privacy as you might think\nAnd it is basically talked about this or are they taking precautions to help make people feel better\nOh for sure I mean you would think that since a role in this out now that might be a little um you know blind to the fact that the timing isn't so great um but they they were in in interviews I did with that and they were very ah self aware I suppose of the fact that this probably doesn't look good to a lot of people so there are privacy things ...\nSample it is not going to uh you know listen to your voice [noise]\nUm and and kind of acknowledge what you're saying that unless you awake in the device by a kind of saying hey portal that's kind of the key word to to let it no you should start listening to um it's not going to record you unless you know you actively or on a video call and even then ... even a recording that's just the cameras on so\nThere are different safety elements that they clearly put in to try to avoid an issue like this but again\nI'm you know do you trust Facebook to to do that the right way and there's a lot of people who are going to say no it's just one hack\nAway from having all those safety precautions sort of vanish um which you know just makes me think what's at stake for Facebook if they messed this up well what's interesting is that um there have been some kind of privacy issues with Amazon's device for example ah you know maybe a recording things that people didn't know was recording all that kind of stuff\nBut I think the big difference between like an Amazon and Facebook is that Amazon does not positioned itself as this kind of place where you build your personal connections and where you store your personal memories if it's more of a utility it's like the place that you use to shop and Facebook on the other hand has has really built an entire brand around\nYou know connecting you to the people you are being in a place for your baby photos and your private messages\nSo when Facebook screws up it feels more intimate than I think it does when when uh Amazon or an apple screws up aren't Wagner senior editor of social media at Recode thank

impact of climate change without damaging the economy\nThey may be radical ideas but they will ugly change their lifestyle rather be who they will have a moment ...\n... and the largest migrant camp in Greece is on the island of Lesbos life is hard for the migrants living there but also for the people trying to help them as a cascade of care to occur if people are going to take care of refugees to took care of themselves first these stories coming up here in\n\nThe news is first\nProfessor north houses the way a carbon tax works is simple\nIt's the idea that you put a price on carbon emissions away you put a price and other things like oil or bread and the ideas you put a price on it then people will reduce the use of it\nWhy do you think this approach has not been accepted and put into practice widely in the United states\nWell first let me say the United states is the place it's been most resistant to it hits in place and other countries it's actually in place in China in Canada\nWidespread and Europe China's extending it from a few of its many cities to a nationwide program so it's mainly the United states which is resisting\nHow and how is it working in those other countries they mentioned\nWell the one that I particularly admire as British Columbia it's a carbon tax but it's also one that returns the revenues to the residents of British Columbia so it's what's called a revenue neutral or recycled covered ducks\nSo what happens is it raises the price of carbon products it goes it's collected but then it's rebate and\nAnd I I think that's particularly attractive because then people see\nAll the government is not taking it and using it for whatever purposes they want but it's basically using the tax to penalize carbon products but then giving people the revenue back so their actual real incomes and inflation protected terms don't go down\nWell you'll have had them for many many years now a huge megaphone hum in in terms of your teaching in terms of international work\nAnd right now you have a larger megaphone because he just won a Nobel Prize so if you are to talk to decision makers which I think you are right now in the United states what's the best argument to adopt a carbon tax system here\n[noise] well I I Would want to broaden it out actually I Would say we need first we need to explain why we have problem with climate why we have a problem with climate change why it's so dangerous and why we need to do something about it we need to clear away all the rhetoric so that's the first thing\nDo you think that that is really not known by now\nThat's a good question I think it's known by lots of people but also it's denied by many people and in particular people and it's widely rejected in public at least by the Republican Party all mentioned the president who is a hoax\nSo we just need to that's the first thing the second thing we need we need to have incentives in place and this is where the carbon\nTax would carbon price and comes to penalize the use of carbon intensive products and includes the use of ... about it but then the third point we're going to need to develop\nTechnologies to replace the current technologies we have in place and that's that's a big job for scientists and engineers and for companies as well say those are the things I Would emphasize public understanding incentives in technology\nWhen President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord last year he cited the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country meaning the U.S [noise]\nUh there are businesses that believe that environmental protection is just too costly it is expensive but I mean can you argue with that\nWell I think if that has done in an efficient way it's actually not that expensive\nThe various estimates made by specialists and the costs over Twenty years would be something like one to two percent of the income so that's what like\nPoint oh five to point one percent
