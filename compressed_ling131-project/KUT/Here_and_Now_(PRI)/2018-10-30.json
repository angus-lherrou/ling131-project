{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "And subject to the jurisdiction thereof are Citizens United that I'm the president cannot tense up by himself now no simple on the subject to the jurisdiction rivals language right but the Supreme Court in ...\nUm expressly held that that does not ... it's you're off it just means that you are you're not in a diplomatic ... I ...\nKnow which case you referring to what I was rereading that case today and I noticed that in that case\nIt involved or the child of a of of of legal residents not to people who were here without ... residency documents\nSo that that's true I mean it's the case is called the United states versus ... and it's definitely true that that case involved\nUm you know individuals who had walked emigrated but the Supreme Court analysis of the tax or the fourteenth amendment did not turn on the fact\nThat they were here lawfully uttered on\nThe conclusion that the language and the citizenship clause that says you have to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United states is not meant to distinguish lawful presence from on lawful presence\nAdoption to distinguish those are here and their own capacity and those who are here solely on some kind of foreign diplomatic represent representational\nNow that's that's an interesting thing because a lot of people go back to the initial language why this birthright citizenship exist at all and perhaps we should touch on that to this came in the wake of the civil war and it had to do with treatment right\n[noise] it it I mean the Supreme Court famously infamously I'm In the Dred Scott decision Eighteen fifty that had held that slaves were not citizens for purposes of the federal constitution I'm Out of course that's you know one of the court's more\nInfamous more vilified Simpsons history right part of the purpose of the citizenship clause the very first step up the fourteenth amendment\nWas to overrule Dred Scott and wants to make it clear that no matter what your history no matter what your lineage even if you had grown up in bondage in a state that traditionally like property you're still a citizen and you were a citizen by dint of the fact that you were born here\n[noise] you know this was made the context of an interview right I mean this is not a formal proposal to our knowledge there hasn't been anything that the executive branch any step that the executive branch has formally taken to try to rescind this but let's just play this out I mean\nEven if you assume that this is about politics and about a ... an election season and tried to drum up support on the right\nUm you know why shouldn't the president and given the fact that this has come up time and time again these questions about what this means why not go ahead and uh and and make such a move since you know that this is going to be challenged in court and test this once and for all\nI mean I guess my reaction is if you really believe what you're saying and they're not just doing\nThe constitution provides avenues for pursuing were for it in the constitution provides and expressed wrote now for\nYou know changing the meaning of the citizenship clause and so I think you know it'd be a lot more convincing\nIf instead of staying he's going to do this by executive order the president actually took the you know legally appropriate step of proposing a constitutional amendment that would change the language of section one of the ... amendment I'm you know the reality might be that that's an amendment without flick that through\nThe house in the Senate but perhaps not be ratified by the requisite thirty states but that's the way the process is supposed to work\nStephen Vladeck is professor of law at the University of Texas school of law professor thanks so much for taking a few minutes out to talk\nWith us thank you and you're listening to the Texas standards\n[noise]\nBorder border border yeah today's top story right now um Wellstone bar social media editor here at the standard what are Texans talking about\nDefinitely will following up on what we just heard gifts Trump saying he would end of the concept of birthright citizenship by executive order sure sparking a lot of pushback on line\nOn our Facebook page Bobby flood says how sad that some Americans were just trash the fourteenth amendment and cheer for Trump's actions if Trump believes he can take away birth rights what other rights do you think he believes he can executive order away\nInteresting perspective there meanwhile on Twitter Genevieve\nA echoes something that I've seen a lot of out there as well David a seems to me this conversation is a way for all of us to stop talking about the eleven dead synagogue attendees the largest assassination attempt in us history referring there to all the bombs sent through the mail and another racist mowing down black people referring there to that shooting\nVote in every race vote in every election Genevieve says so some people sort of see this as a distraction if you will another listener see something similar it's inseparable from the mid term Joel says that Trump is in spaghetti mode\nThrowing everything at the wall and see what sticks and get his die hards\nOut to the polls and he does have supporters you know the concept of uh Indian birthright citizenship isn't exactly like a French thing on the Republican side it's got many supporters I Believe Ted Cruz\nWas ... a previously voiced his support of ending a birthright citizenship one of them winning us a Marshall wolf she says that no one should receive automatic citizenship at the mother cross the border just to give birth of the parents aren't in green card mode there shouldn't be any automatic citizenship [noise]\nYou know every few years it seems like this issue of birthright citizenship flares up as a when a commentator said briefly but brightly a and we see a lot of news articles and I don't think we've heard the last of this conversation even if the president doesn't move forward I think we're going to see a lot more commentary built around this uh this idea\nDecidedly selling one last interesting perspective here from Leah Keith on her Facebook page\nShe notes that the president may not be thinking about the thousands of service members serving overseas that this could affect birthright citizenship citizenship works both ways not only for those people born here but also for those born to us are citizens serving around the world interesting per se but yeah there is\nYeah uh you know it's interesting a there's a group I'm a ... is co migration policy they they uh they publish a I Believe this is the migration Policy Institute indeed it is and they have said that if in fact\nYou were to get rid of a a ... a a a birthright\nCitizenship a section in the fourteenth amendment\nWhat she would be looking at is a basically the unauthorized population ballooning to twenty four million in twenty fifty from the eleven million today on all things are kept equal yeah so it's interesting stuff vendetta again I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about it\nDefinitely

Dave Thompson radio news director at Prairie Public broadcasting I gave\n[noise] hello how are you in Robyn I'm good thanks so give us some context Heidi Heitkamp trailing Republican challenger by several planes and he's the kind of thing Kevin ... she is used to being an underdog downright\nYes she is if you about six years she was down about ten points at the same point and she won that a ... by about three thousand votes\nSo she did that in twenty twelve and this is the same year the bit round me when the whole state by fifty eight percent so don't count her out right and and tell us more about her and what's happened to her standing in the state over time\nShe has been a very popular person she was a appointed death tax commissioner and she was elected as attorney general state of North Dakota\nAnd she was running a a very good race for governor or before she had to drop out in twenty oh eight\nWhen uh she was diagnosed with breast cancer and that unfortunately probably made the difference that race but uh then she came back and twelve to win the Senate race but in the same year Kevin Cramer was elected to Congress so they served in Washington same time and a congressman Kramer's been elected re elected twice\nYeah so you've got these two popular politicians and just talking about this moment when Heidi Heitkamp and now she vote no on Kavanaugh even though she knew it would hurt her politically in the state of North Dakota ...\nI'm hanging hanging out and I thought you said you're exactly why I voted against ... first shot and honestly\nI don't think he told the truth and even if he did he showed him how to be true biased to be impartial I voted for Neal going and you know I Know there are many other conservative judges who can do this job without nearing our country apart\nSo gave very plain spoken there I don't think he told the truth how do people react to that\nOh for a while there and it became a kind of an issue in North Dakota because\nA justice Kevin I had a had a pretty good approval ratings of from North Dakota voters but when it came down to it I think that whole thing about the cabin all race is kind of died down now and uh we're looking at more pocketbook issues in North Dakota so\nIn terms of affecting her turn out\nThere are a lot of a political advisers I've been talking to a lot of observers who said\nThat she was in a no win situation no matter what if she was voted for Kavanaugh she could've hurt for standing with her base in North Dakota and if she voted against it there were a lot of people say the Republicans wouldn't have gone with her anyway\nNight ... and and this time and a half million that came in at from across the country supporting her because she did that ... ... people don't see that making a big difference\nThey don't know if it's going to make a big difference I Know a Congress and Kramer would like to point that out needed in a debate that was held last friday he pointed out the twelve and a half million dollars came in and he branded as being from pro abortion groups and senator I kept snap back and said shame on you\nYeah well he's also portrayed her decision to vote now as cave in to the coastal elite base he said well known candidate she said North Dakota's only congressman let's listen to a new Congress and Kramer's ads and this one he's walking among bulldozers and other heavy machinery you hear it rumbling in the background\nCutting taxes and rolling back regulations that were slowly in our business\nOur national economy is booming\nHe mentions economic rocket ship we know the economy is booming right now but they might be a bumpy landing a when the tax cuts off with they're already starting to end the terrorists to bite so how was he addressing that with farmers and manufacturers in North Dakota\nIn terms of farmers and manufacturers he's he's got the same kind of message\nThat did this might be a bump on the road but you look you have to look at it long term that if they act actually can settle some of these disputes and get better deals for North for the farmers north kinda manufacturers it's going to be good in the long run mother some farmers agree with that some farmers do not as they see soybeans piling up uh with no market\nAnd that that really is a conundrum for a lot of people\nThat's Dave Thompson radio news director at Prairie Public

expected to hire as many as six hundred and fifty thousand workers this holiday season\nAmazon alone is hiring one hundred thousand at at least Fifteen dollars an hour\nThat axis adding fifty five thousand at fourteen that gap is hiring sixty four thousand in part timers get a fifty percent discount\nIt seems they're doing anything to lure in workers' when there aren't a lot available people have jobs the unemployment rate is so low I leave el she isn't MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent he's also co host of Vail she enrolled highly hey Robin and get us wherever thumbnail of this season compared to pass it's\nIt's probably a good season for people looking for this temporary work which is a big deal by the way because a lot of people get hired in this season so first of all we're looking for holiday sales to jump a almost five percent from two thousand Seventeen which is really good\nI'm ... and there are a you know we have a very low unemployment rate we are what you call full employment so uh there's more money that's going to be spent there's more of that business up to grab this up for grabs her some companies because some companies have gone out of business\nUm so uh it's a good time to get hired it's also a good time to buy because a number of these companies are offering better deals of for a for people who were shopping more you know faster shipping lower prices things like that so all in all if you're a buyer or you are looking for work this holiday season it's it's looking pretty\nGood well we're hearing that that Fifteen dollar an hour and that added on coffee might be the average and neck or thirty two percent increase over last year and you shall we just heard Jeremy speaking with Alan Greenspan ... about how this is a job seekers market but when you're going through these part time jobs can you go in and say oh yeah and they could Seventeen I mean you\nKnow I Know but the fact is the fact that target had trouble hiring people meant that they raise their wages some time ago than Wal Mart or followed on that\nUh and then a a Amazon did and they all sort of say that it's part of his movement to raise minimum wage but the fact is it's all market driven they're actually having trouble and they're losing workers to each other\nSo no the individual worker can't demand more but the individual worker is a likely to get more than they would've a year ago and be likely to have options so they can go from one employer to the other and compare offers and possibly do better so generally speaking the good thing\nBecause you know because wages aren't moving in at full time jobs yeah yeah a lot of people will be going for part time to add to their fulltime and I just want to give a shout out to UPS which is giving about the same benefit it gets to regular work as a part time work at UPS\nAt those locations can get that twenty five thousand dollars in education assistance you know time is\nSo look the part time gig is a is a side hustle for a lot of people right we we talk about uh being low unemployment but the fact that the number of people work two jobs\nTo make the same money wages have been stagnant they started to increase in the last ... years since about two thousand and Fifteen but inflation has also gone up for it so all things being equal the median income earners in America is not earning more than they were\nBefore the recession but we are seeing an uptick in wages at the lower end\nAnd for part time workers and remember those people also spend money so that should be stimulated to the economy\nAnd we just want to say what we know you would want us to Sally they'll see that even though we have a Fifteen year fifty year at a high unemployment low um and we've got this robust economy workers that must come down inflation is a robust economy friend and so it's also turned to see\nThat is exactly right and you can actually get a little bit for your savings now so that's good

Hi Kara Hi how you doing good but chose a reaction to what people thought I Know yeah people thought it was Hillary Clinton saying I Want to run for president your first thought\nShe was not saying she was running for president she was saying she would like to be president that's a different thing that's what I took away from and I was sitting next to her right\nAnd you're the one asking her questions you tweeted that out but that didn't stop people from you know speculating and there was both some hope but also a lot of outrage let's listen to the full context of what Secretary Clinton told you last week at the Ninety second street lights the taping of the ... cast [noise]\nPlenty hiding it do you want to run again no [noise] no pause why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nThink hopefully when we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one\nThere's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confused everybody in the world including ourselves and\nWe're confused our friends and our enemies they have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important as a so don't work would be work that I feel very well prepared for having done in a sad for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department\nAnd it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting or you going to be doing any of that left him Staley oh I have no idea care but I'm I'm going to you know I'm not going to even think about when we get through this ah November sex selection about what's going to happen after that but I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure\nWe have a Democrat in the White House come January\nOkay so Kara um she was talking about how America's policies and have confused a lot of people around the world but she did could pose some people there by paying a little bit yeah she's not going to be running I'd like to be president what did you take it from that\nI think she she she could have been more explicit let's be clear she could have said I Am absolutely not running for president but I'd like to help whatever candidate is to do this or I Would be part of it and I'd be happy to be part of it and ... that was a democratic minister ration and twenty Twenty one\nI'm so I think she could have been more explicit and so in a lot of ways she was sort of have your cake and eat it too but I she has no intention of running from what from the people I talked to and the people close to her and she\nHerself I think it has sort of left that off the table\nWell and we could hear a lot of disappointment in the audience that come to hear her speak but also other Democrats voicing concern that she was injecting herself a into politics just a week before the midterms when the Republicans and specifically President Trump use her as someone to gin up their base and get people to vote\nA for Republicans I'm you did try to shift to attention to other potential democratic candidates and twenty twenty or I'm Elizabeth Warren Michael Bloomberg what'd she say\nShe almost she she was being very diplomatic about all I Know she has more thoughts on them both positive and negative but she tried to stress the positive aspects of each of them\nUm and what kind of candidates sick bay and sort of was assessing them on that she didn't do the negative assessments um but I think what what she was trying to say if there's plenty of people in the in the slate of candidates and all of them would be different essentially\nUm what was really interesting about it to me is that what happens whenever she says anything she obviously is Trump's favorite a person to attack you know among his base\nAt the same time other people who have lost elections and she didn't quite lose if when she lost you can lose the popular vote at least which must be just grading upon her you know always I Would think for the rest of her life she had three million more votes than President Trump yes yes\nSo other candidates who lost to John McCain who's of course pass John Kerry Mitt Romney they all got to speak to speak up now that gets you kept quite loudly and whenever she does Democrats\nAnother decry her for doing so I I find that really unusual and and I think she should be able to talk up I think she should be able to say anything she wants and then everything she says shouldn't be parsed quite so much\nWell so we're still left with her saying you asked if she would do the heavy lifting\nYou meant I think well you know will will you run for president I think she heard it as well I help other candidates um she said she wasn't running but she liked to be president and you interpreted that as a writer who wouldn't have wanted to put that much working and be a politician who wouldn't\nHave wanted to be president um but it still this sort of a cloud of away uh she meant but you did after specifically about Russian interference in the midterms what did she say\nWell she she had done that because uh right after the election I didn't interview with her where she was sort of a painting the picture of exactly what the ... investigation found at the time people had made fun of her for doing that and calling her paranoid and so I wanted to point out that she was entirely right about what she had said about the impact of the Russians\nI unfortunately I think we'll never know what the true impact\nIs except that they were there and it had some impact and so she ... she was discussing essentially we were discussing essentially that she was right about what had happened and what we need to do going forward and she definitely a criticize the social media companies for their role in that problem and wondered whether they were prepared for elections going forward\n[noise] that's ...
