Valdez happening the first and last debate happening this past friday none too many disinterested inclinations those names to moved the needle either which way the headline on the Dallas Morning news website seems to say at all after debate\nRace between Greg Abbott and loop it Valdez still is news or\nI Do wonder how widely obscene was seen just\nThinking that you know what I'm saying you know a Valdez I think he's not quite crack the million dollar mark in the latest are reporting a you know documents that have come out and yet a Greg Abbott has an enormous\nEnormous campaign sitting on a lot of cash there you know that morning news article from Grammer Jeffrey seems to sort of some of the elite consensus that those hasn't had an alright nights but the alright ain't enough to cut it when you're facing that those sorts of lots of people sending off\nA on Twitter Haley Jane Says the Greg Abbott totally won that debate that loop if Valdez was busy taking notes the entire time\nMeanwhile Gail tweeted that she watched the debate and felt that this him off his genuine and well informed and Abbott sounded like a bureaucrat and and I think that may have been sort of part of um uh the the strategy there you know it was a very you didn't see any real pointed attacks from Greg either on on Valdez because\nYou know he's just kind of trying to float above the fray I think you could say it was a friday night it happened\nDuring the Texas Tribune fest when a lot of folks were in downtown Austin to you know um and you know the friday night lights\nYou know things that are like you know speaking about the Texas Tribune festival I feel like there may have been more people at that Beto O'Rourke rally after his appearance\nThat's just really it was on a yes or and as you mentioned you are quite an impressive turn out for that rally featuring Willie Nelson and I was yeah reports in that range into this tweet from ... fan she says that last night's rally in Austin was powerful\nThe fact that it was the largest since Obama's Portland rally in two thousand eight an even larger than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump's presidential rallies gives me hope and now I had not Arabs or that and it appears to be true staggering number\nAppears to be borne out by the wall Street Journal they called it the largest gathering by politicians since Obama rally in two thousand eight a clip thing yes even the presidential campaign rallies\nFrom Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and that Clinton won even featured like Bon Jovi talking about Willie Nelson and the draw their right Alan ... a featured some celebrity performers and it's interesting scanning Twitter you do see more of those sort of Obama comparison\nMaybe it's partially partially because of Obama's like you had that rally in downtown Austin where there are a bunch of Democrats obviously are but that's sort of a ... just the sheer amount of people there and the sort of energy in that crowd it it's interesting that this is getting the attention of the Texas Governor as well but I think\nReferred to a better or ... what a cult like ... like you have to run to the you know where does the fact we heard that in the round up you know and other ... social media news folks were knowing what he did with this time a yesterday Sunday he was originally set to debate Ted Cruz Sunday but that was called off limits the Kavanaugh\nConfirmation controversy so crews apparently tried to reschedule but ... said he was busy\nAnd his plans included live streaming the recording of a new campaign commercial oh you're kidding yeah yeah he used Facebook Live to stream I think for different takes for a thirty second spot so\nSome of the GOP we're using that timing\nTo attack him saying that hey why don't you read what other folks saying hey you know I think he's got his kitchen he was probably back you know have to probably taking a breather\nPlus you hear that music and that means the time's up for the big broadcast with a news continues on line in Texas standards dot O.

at noon that's here and now to mark\n[noise] obviously [laughter] whoa obviously some problems with here and now we'll get to NPR News in an era now coming right up\nJustices they heard two cases today I and you know technically Brett Kavanaugh could actually rule on a these these cases if he is in fact confirmed after not hearing the arguments which would be kind of odd a and a lot of people looking at that and saying there's no real precedent for that so how\nThis court goes is anyone's guess at this point depending on how long this\nControversy continues NPR's lead politics editor Domenico Montanaro thanks very much you're You're welcome\nWell the other thing on the agenda in Washington today as a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada that will replace NAFTA it's called the U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement President Trump talked about it this morning at the White House\nI have to certainly\nGive my highest regards to prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau a lot of stories came out about adjusted and I\nAre having difficulty in together and we did over the trade deal\nI'll tell you it's turned out to be a very very good deal for both and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before\n[noise] change in tone there from President let's bring in the CBC is Evan dire in Ottawa Evan the deal has a new name but how different is it from NAFTA\n[noise] well there are some technical difference as it is basically in most respects the same agreement to free trade and you know was never really fully free trade between the U.S Mexico and Canada\nAnd the way you see it in the European Union or in the European Union for example countries can accuse each other of dumping and they can't impose countervailing duties in under NAFTA\nOr you could do that that and then of course the country's had a remedy to seek to resolve disputes and that's the master that we're going to have under the U.S and see I in fact\nUh the same system around dispute resolution has survived intact which is quite a relief for Canada that was one of its red lines had wanted to have those independent pedals rather than have to fight these cases out in us domestic courts or so in that respect it looks very much the same as the old enough to\nHow our Canadians feeling about it today\nWell can you first of all would have to I'd have to say they're relieved because NAFTA\nRepresents a huge part of the Canadian economy candidate being a smaller country than the u._s. it's more of an exporting nation because it's on domestic market is smaller\nOr being a smaller country next to a much bigger country of course that other countries market is more important proportionally to each Canadians pocket book that it would be for each Americans I mean the overall effect on both economies would probably be detrimental to free trade came to an end but it would be felt more here\nSo relief would be the main sensation here I guess uh but then different sectors react differently because there are winners and losers as there are others who see a sort of a status quo that would probably describes the majority of people\nAre there's relief in the auto sector there is a little bit of dismay and the dairy sector\nAnd that sort of what we expected what do you not know about this deal yet that you'd like to know\n[noise] well there are a lot of questions about the terrorists that have been put on Canada outside of NAFTA those national security terrorists that upset every ...\nWell steel and aluminum and of course then there was also a threat for cars and trucks no as a result of this arrangement us MCA it seems that the threat of tariffs on Canadian cars and trucks will go away that would have been a real killer blown Trump called it the mother lode\nOr last week and the news conference in the in the a lot of policy auto in New York but the feeling tired still limited powers are going to stay in place the U.S is insisting that that's not part of NAFTA that's a separate track Canada's hoping that this investigation by the U.S department of commerce will have concluded by the time this deal is actually signed\nAnd they will have come to the conclusion that Canada is not a national security threat to the United states and that those terrorists will then be\nLifted anyway but it's pretty odd to be going into a new trade agreement with\nEach country having sixty billion dollars worth of tariffs against the other and in the case of the U.S you know literally describing Canada's a national security threat and that as much as the dollar amount as certainly annoyed people in Canada\nWell let me finally ask you about that ... this negotiation has been pretty ugly between a President Trump and Justin Trudeau the Canadian prime minister\nI did notice that the name of disagreement is the United states Mexico Canada agreement with Canada last even though alphabetically it would be first and second what do you think this is done to the relationship between the U.S and Canada\nWell on that day first of all I must say I was in that news conference in New York last weekend Donald Trump was talking about he liked the name you SM see because it's down sounds like US marine corps right so\nThis is the name of the agreement probably doesn't mean that much because he had already said that when there was a bilateral deal between the U.S and Mexico it was going to be the U.S and so now Canada the third to sign on it's sort of follows I suppose that it would have its name at the end here people are not focused on this medics nobody really cares about that you can call it whatever he wants\nBut with the relationship in general\nUh yes this has been seen in Canada as an exercising arm twisting and bullying a there has been a lot of misinformation put out by the White House including the the basic claim that there's a deficit with Canada which is simply not true U.S Department of commerce figures show that that is not true\nThis is a balance trade relationship in which there's actually a slight surplus for the U.S with goods and services over Canada one of only two countries in the world I Believe the U.S has surplus with is Canada\nSo candidate did not understand why it was called on to make all these concessions and uh it you know was surprised actually when Donald Trump campaigned against Mexico and then govern did seemed turning its attention more on Canada making a deal first with Mexico which is a low wage environments\nUh and and really putting that putting the screws to Canada so will there be lasting damage you know I don't know I mean the Canadians take a dim view generally if the Trump Administration after Donald Trump is gone will that linger on\nIt's always difficult being the smaller neighbor dealing with a big country like the U.S and you sometimes you just have to learn to roll with the punches and in this case I guess preserving NAFTA meant just kind of going along with certain things that Canadians felt\nWere unfair for the greater good C B c's Evan dire joining us from Ottawa Evan thank you thanks Sherman you're

B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd this is hearing now Republican Lisa Murkowski is one of the few key senators who will decide the future of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAlaska Senator senator agreed that a final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination should be delayed for a week well the FBI investigates claims of sexual assault against them and since then some constituents who have been protesting outside her office in Juneau\n\nLiz Russian is DC correspondent for Alaska Public media and she joins us now from Washington Hi Liz Hi Peter\nA lot of people want to know what Lisa Murkowski is thinking but it seems as if she has been a little shy of reporters lately have have you heard anything from her in the last few days\nUm she yeah she is not saying what she thinks right now and I wouldn't expect her to we do know that after Christine Blasey Ford testify that Senator Murkowski said she found her to be very credible\nUm that was before the judge spoke at the hearing so we don't know what he said about that but Murkowski is a moderate and she sticks to a moderate position and all things that's part of her temperament as part of her how she got elected\nUh-huh so she is a moderate and she's shown streaks of independence before she cast a vote last year that helped block the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act um but she still from a conservative state so ... how to voters feel about that are they okay for instance with her decision to delay the vote\n[noise] ah I'm not sure about that specific question but we do have polling about how Alaskans Neal about it and slightly more Alaskans I'll want ... chicken farm\nBut among Murkowski's base the people who have a favorable view of Murkowski\nA majority of them want her to reject Kavanaugh and in general conservatives and the Republican Party don't really have a big hold on Murkowski and I think they're used to Murkowski disappointing them\nYou asked her a last week if she ever had a meat to moment and she said yes but she didn't elaborate do you think that's factoring at all and into her decision here\n[noise] it's factors in in that cheese and American Woman and had some kind of experience that she didn't want to talk about I don't I don't think there's any reason to believe that it has a direct impact on how she's thinking about\nThis so do you get the sense that if there's no new significant information and that FBI investigation that she will be inclined to stick by cabin on in the end\nI think that she would be inclined to stick by Kavanaugh because she has always voted to confirm\nRepublican Supreme Court nominees and she has rejected both of Obama's at President Obama's nominees so I think that is her inclination but she is getting a lot of pressure from the last to vote now\nDo you think she relishes this role as someone who has so much sway in this huge decision\nNo I Do not think she's not a flashy senator she does not\nLike to be in the spotlight for a national issue like this however we do know that she is able to use her status as a swing vote among Republicans to get things from a leadership that she feels are important to Alaska\nWas rescued a D.C correspondent for Alaska Public

Derek Thompson senior editor at the Atlantic Hi Derek hey Jeremy and President Trump called this a historic transaction he is calling it the United states and Mexico Canada trade agreement how big of a change is it really though how how different is it from NAFTA it's\nDifferent fish or it makes it easier for dairy farmers to fell into Canada and it makes it easier or harder I should say for car companies to outsource their work to Mexico so if you're a dairy farmer in the U.S\nOr if you were in the auto manufacturing industry particularly if you're in a auto manufacturing union they feel is probably going to help you\nBut the big picture here is I see it is that\nTrump in the campaign twenty six team didn't say I think NAFTA could use a minor tweak he said NAFTA was the worst trade deal in world history\nAnd this basically keeps the parameters of NAFTA with several new benefits for certain groups so you know to me this is a bit like saying LaGuardia Airport is the worst airport in the world\nAnd an opening a food court in terminal a and saying look I don't you a new airport like look there's nothing wrong with a food court and there's nothing wrong with opening up access to selling you know milk products in Canada but this is not a new trade deal this is not a new thing this is basically ... to point out\nBut are his supporters gonna view it that way or is this a win as far as they're concerned\nYeah I mean if if his supporters of dairy farmers are going to be happy if his supporters work in the car manufacturing industry I'm sure they're going to be happy I'm you know in terms of the biggest losers here it's not yet entirely clear I think that people who support Donald Trump it has been shown in poll after poll they basically support him no matter what and this\nIn a bad trade deal it's it's a it's a fine trade deal it's just extremely subtle\nCompared with the criticisms that Trump had for the previous trade deal and it should be said that in twenty sixteen\nAs a part of the TPP a negotiations the Trans Pacific partnership negotiations Obama's team was negotiating with Canada and Mexico and actually extracted many of the exact same benefits that Trump has now extracted from those countries\nIn twenty Eighteen and so I think the confusion here for a lot of economists said if you're going to take Trump's seriously when he criticized his nap time when he pulls out of TPP if you did in his first week as president is\nIf your if there was all this bluster about how bad these trade agreements are and then two years later you're basically just reenacting them and putting a new name on it and what exactly we've been talking about for the last year and a half\nWell what does it mean for the manufacturing industry in this country which President Trump has been focused on since before he became president he's been telling people and a lot of states in the Midwest especially that you know we're going to bring your jobs back we're going to the manufacturing industry in this country is gonna boom again\nRight on the one hand it's important to say the steel tariffs remain in place or they might open up more negotiations in the future with Canada ... but for now the steel tariffs remain in place and that's something that the steel manufacturing industry quite legs\nBut whenever we're talking about manufacturing it's important to say let's define what a comeback is in Nineteen Seventy nine there were twenty million manufacturing workers when Trump became president there were twelve point three million now there's twelve point seven million right so we've added four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs\nIn the last Eighteen months that's not bad to manufacturing jobs are coming back\nBut we're never going to have anything close to the Nineteen seventies economy again and so you know when I talk to economists about you know how do you plan the economy the future they say well planned for the economy\nOf the future don't try to create the conditions to to grasp for the economy that we had in Nineteen Seventy nine and so it just seems like there's an enormous amount of effort being placed on creating conditions for the revitalization of a tiny tiny part of the U.S economy which isn't steel manufacturing\nWhen in fact we were just in Indiana a recently doing some reporting on manufacturing there and one of the problems that they say that they have in the industry there is you know we've got the jobs we just don't have workers that are trained to do the new manufacturing jobs\nDark or just in the thirty seconds that we have left here what do you think that this news about the U.S what we call us MCA us now to\nUh what does that mean for countries that the U.S government is still in sort of trade disputes with and thinking about the European Union in particular\nThe European Union and China a you know if this gift Trump confidence that history strategy is working that might embolden him\nTo hold out on China um it might involved and then to hold on the European Union as well on the other hand if you take the outcome at this negotiation on his face and you say Trump is going to have a lot of bluster there's going to be a lot of criticism of the status quo\nBut you're going to end up with the status quo I mean to be clear us MCA NAFTA to point out whatever you call it it's basically exactly what the Obama administration had\nToward the end of twenty sixteen and so if that's your precedent then you're going to end you're going to have a lot of last year but ended up
