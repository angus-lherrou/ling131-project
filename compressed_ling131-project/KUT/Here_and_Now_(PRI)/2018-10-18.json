{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "And they are critical to improving our state embarrassing standard as being one of the least\nTo vote in the country will they're young you just touched on something that's really important here I mean I Know you talk to more than a thousand plus young people about why they don't vote and what did you come up with\nWell you know they had their reasons about\nThat they didn't necessarily trust politician but they didn't feel that their votes mattered um but when it really came down to the qualitative energy is that we did with young people many said they wanted to vote but they didn't have information and the truth is that we also found in other studies have shown that even the majority of Latinos say they want to well\nMost of them will never be contacted by campaign or candidate\nI Want to I Want to ask you about this because this study identifies four major reasons that uh these young people gave you for not voting one of them is cynicism could you talk about that just a bit\n[noise] yeah we found that a lot of young Latinos in fact have felt cynical about politics they didn't feel like their vote matter that they didn't feel like their voice was heard from this study we found that respondents cared about legalizing marijuana canceling student debt health care for all and of course immigration\nBut most candidates when they talk the Latino community if they talk to them at all [noise] mostly talk to them about immigration so they really nothing to mark\nSomething else there was a bit of a surprise young people told you that they don't feel educated enough to vote is is it an issue of self perception does this get back to being courted by the candidates or not being courted by the cat is what does that mean they they don't feel educated enough to vote\nYeah we found that many people felt that they didn't know who the candidates where are the differences between the parties um and I think that that was a really troubling sign that there was a lot more our government could be doing and the major parties could be given to educate people about where they stand on the issues that matter to Latino voters I'm so that they can make informed that\nThis does any of this have to do with whether you're first generation or second generation I mean does it break down that way\nYeah you know it's an interesting theory and I had that same theory we actually pulled data to see if they're what the difference between someone like me a child of immigrants where someone that was a generation Texan and they're voting participation and we actually found that there was\nNot a different um but what was consistent as for example like the not so much higher percentage of the specially younger Latina than our male counterparts yeah why is winds that\n[noise] you know we don't know quite yet but like you know ages Eighteen to twenty four\nTwenty five percent margin that they were more likely to vote than their male counterparts that's a huge difference so I think it shows that Latinos are leading the way in our community and what can we tap into with their leadership to impact the rest of the like and what can be\nSo Christina let's just imagine a hypothetical here a politician approaches you knowing who you are and what should the sort of work that jolt has done and they say okay we want to embrace Latino voters what would you tell them their strategy should be\nAnd what we think there's three simple things that people can be going to be clear but the most part is not happening right now in Texas but one we need to register Latino voter that needs to be part of any candidate a message to you need to understand the issues that matter to Latino voters\nAnd the third thing they have to do they have to spend the time and money knocking on the doorstep\nGoing to churches into the community to reach them and get them out to vote but again you're gonna find there's been numerous studies conducted nationally it most Latino voters are under invested in and take it for granted by boat which a political party right now\nThat's the voice of Christina sing soon Ramirez she leads jolt in Austin based organization focused on energizing young Latino voters and her latest report is called we are Texas and analysis of young Latino voters and the Lone Star state Cristina thanks again for speaking with us\nThanks so much for having me and you are listening to the Texas standards\n[noise]\nThese back social media editor wells Dunbar that use water Texans talking about on this Thursday well folks are talking about the discussion we just heard a look at\nLatino voters and their reasons for sitting out elections in many cases here are some of the things we're seeing on her Facebook page\nThere Marta Hubbard says if they realize the tremendous power they hold\nIt would change many things meanwhile Brad ... says that's only assuming all currently non voting Texas Latinos would vote Democrat goes on to say that's not a safe assumption\nEr and um you know we do have some very interesting races coming up uh coming up here and the other group and it's a real raised with ... Valdez or so but it really will be fascinating to see the role of a Latino Latino voters are in the mid term elections coming right up your absolutely there's been a lot of commentary on line\nTo them and just look in the past couple of days and it's something you touched on a ... this idea the assumption that a Latino as a Latino vote in a certain way I'm may maybe some surprises at least that's where some of the commentary\nYeah is pointing to definitely one to watch and shifting gears I suppose we need to talk about this one the Boston Red Sox increase their lead over the Houston Astros last night with that eight to six when leaving bones and one went away for him taking the American league championship series though as things started to look a little dire for Houston\nPlenty of fans are asking what might have been had what looked like a two run Astros Homer been ruled as such and not called out over fan interference instead I think you know what I'm Talking about air yes in the first inning it looked like throws hitter has failed to they said one into the stands\nSox catcher ... best left up to catch it as did several fans on the front rows at the minute maid park and I got\nTo say judging from the replay it looked like that glove closed after the ball grazed the side of it so it looked like he would not have caught it but in the glove also grazed against fans trying to watch the ball leading umpire Joe West ... the most hated man in Houston to rule the home run out\nYeah lots of folks talking about this one end and you can see the replay or I saw this one clip on YouTube it was like five it was like you know it was like was approved or film it was like five to frame by frame it was insane on her Facebook page Charles Xavier says the fan did not reach over the rail that should've been fair game\n... reached into the stands over the rail and his real crime was not catching yet\nMeanwhile are pound Johnny he'll ... says that if that didn't interfere it would have been caught so obviously the jury is still out there ... yeah yeah uh\nWhat are you know the cross or for the for the Astros trying to defend their title and all that exactly you never know you never know what's going to move the needle I guess the speaking of which we should probably mention this Columbia Journalism review you they know that the New York times the needle remembered the needle on election night\nRight oh it's going to go to a point and no no no shaking violently and it's going to go to All right I remember coming back baby for the people and the people in my Twitter

the Florida Panhandle has ever seen one of the worst I was doing his job as governor but he's also a candidate running for US Senate seat against democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson\nThat means

... everyone knows him in the state and he has always wanted to play this moderate guy right he wants to make sure he reaches across the aisle when he was a governor she worked with Republicans who worked with Democrats\nAnd he always talks about that governor medicine has also been trying to avoid democratic endorsements which is very interesting so for example you said that if he were to be elected to the U.S and then she would not be supporting democratic leadership\nSo he would not be supporting a Chuck Schumer\nAnd he's been talking about that he's been talking about how the Democratic party needs a new leadership so\nShe's trying to appeal to the moderates appealed to toast Republicans who might be on the fence but also uh being appealing to the Democrats\nThe Democrats on the left who has been making a showing it in the polls in recent elections so let's listen to one as a governor better since as and these are his supporters ...\nI'm a lifelong Republican I'm a Republican I'm a Republican but I'm supportive of rice and 'cause he can work across the aisle and work both parties anymore what Democrats may work with Republicans sometimes that means he doesn't make everybody in his party happy ... responsible\nAnd you work with Republicans to bring both black and two hundred thousand jobs like this guy gets things done they'll certainly different than the buyout in Washington\nSo there you have an ad from governor better since campaign he's a Democrat but obviously just as you said the ... he's trying to get those moderate Republicans who may be feeling that Marsha Blackburn too far to the right\nThat's right and he doesn't make everyone happy like the ad says\nFor example he recently came out things you would have voted for justice Kavanaugh something that goes against the majority of the Democrats who were\nUm rallying against the justice so he is trying again to show that he is among or that he's willing to listen to both sides and then make a decision on behalf of Tennessee and that's what he's been saying\nDuring the whole campaign but that's something that a black run campaign and specifically Marsha Blackburn has um you know used as part of of that you know attack\nOn one of the debates up Blackburn said that she had the chance to run as a Democrat he had the chance to run as a Republican or as an independent but he chose to run as a Democrat so he is part of the establishment that's what I'm Marsha Blackburn has tried to say during this whole campaign\nIn and trying to get the moderate Republicans away from Marsha Blackburn and doing things like can they being in favor of confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court does he run the danger of putting off people who have been loyal Democrats for years\nIt it definitely affects him and he's running with this thing that he has any of the past I Need studs some of his volunteers are even leaving his campaign ... they can't stand why he's appointed Brett Kavanaugh and so that's something that it's ... it's going against him and he needs to figure it out before the election\nYeah yeah I can see the American is now time to political reporter at National
