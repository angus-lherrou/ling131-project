{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "For the Texas standard I'm showing petri with typewriter wrote [noise]\nAfghanistan Texas children's hospital found Atkinson can TANF assigning\nThe people who were at his rally in Montana and he's real life with a lot of these rallies are no longer getting the type of live coverage than it used to Soviet he has to mix it up a little bit more and be a little bit more edgy and more controversial\nBut this is something that is causing headaches for Republicans across the country who are struggling to figure out a message for these midterms and having to answer questions about the president's celebrating violence against a journalist is not something where they want to be doing right before ...\nOkay well let's talk about the midterms here this is President Trump giving kind of his closing argument\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of cabinet all\nThe caravan\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it said\nOkay so that's the president and then here's one of the key Democrats running for office a Beto O'Rourke in Texas He's the Democrat who's facing Ted Cruz he's had a debate with Ted Cruz and then he he did a town hall here he is this week giving kind of his closing argument\nThe bitterness the partisanship pettiness the dishonesty that defined so much of a national conversation we're in desperate need right now of inspiration Beth\nWho has the edge right now going into the mid term just weeks away\nWell it's it's it's very frustrating for many Republicans that President Trump a continues to sort of switched messages they they really want him talking about the strong economy that\nThe low unemployment rate uh the the soaring Dow although we've seen some ups and downs and the debt recently it's it's generally quite high um he keeps diverting from that message onto other things and\nYes to some degree the caravan and and so such will will motivate 'em some Republican voters as well but Kavanaugh hearings but it's not the most positive message that the Republicans want him to be put forward and and and and to have to sort of\nSwitching gears all the time and it followed whatever a President Trump is saying at any given mega rally is is a little bit head standing on the other hand is is that sort of message of inspiration and help from Beto O'Rourke a the the prevailing democratic message\nI wouldn't say so that's a good that's a good message for him for his brand is he's he's trying to kind of go for that very unifying\nA brand yeah that's sort of Obama south from two thousand seven\nBut really I'm In out in the states what we're mostly saying is Democrats talking about health care they feel like that is the winning message that's what voters want to talk about\nThey're very concerned that a protections for pre existing conditions will be removed from a hindrance plans if Republicans get back in there so Democrats are really trying to stay focused on that so we will see who's got the stronger message in just a couple of weeks\nBut totally we are seeing reporting this week that Republicans are starting to feel just a little bit more confident heading into November I mean do do you think they have any reason to be\nWell they did see the ah the Kavanaugh hearings as a net positive for them in terms of the enthusiasm gap we've seen\nIncredible enthusiasm among Democrats over the past couple of years in special elections and in the election in Virginia\nHigh turnout rate and we haven't seen that matched by Republicans they believe that the cabinet hearings helped to bring some of those Republicans on board and make them more enthusiastic\nIt's hard to tell how much of that is spin versus actual polling numbers that were actually manifest in turn out I think the Democrats still have the edge just because there's a ... obviously if you're on their side but there's so much anxious about President Trump\nSo much motivation to get out and sent him a message and we've already started to see some numbers in early polling or sorry early voting that shows that Democrats are are turning out in in high numbers don't have to wait and see if that sustains itself throughout the next couple of weeks and on election day but right now the Democrats do have the edge\nSo one thing that we have not been able to talk about because it just keeps getting overshadowed by other news is what happened with Nikki Haley a you know she she she's left her job as the UN ambassador for the United states and then uh she sent this last night at the Al Smith dinner\nAnd are toxic political environment\nAt her and some people in both parties\nDescribed their opponents as enemies are evil\nOkay but what do you read into that about Nikki Haley\nNikki Haley has a political future she wants to political future and she is sticking out her own territory separate and apart from the president she's actually played this pretty smart made her whole stand in the cabinet uh was was a an ... a very smart way for her to\nGet herself out there and get a national reputation get an international reputation without being too closely tied to the president's physically she was distant from him she was up in New York when he's down to Washington and she would stake out positions at the un that actually contradicted things that he would say in Washington on on Russia\nAnd other topics and now she's ... basically walking away from the cabinet on her own terms to set up her own political life in the future I Do not believe that she intends to run against him and twenty twenty she says she won't uh there's no reason for her to do so but she's a young woman and she's got quite a future and cheat what we saw last night with her sticking that out over the years to come\nTo that means if she doesn't run in twenty twenty and it does seem a stretch that she might if she doesn't she has to stay relevant for a very long time\nYeah I mean that's that's the case and she plans to to do that she said she was going to campaign for President Trump and twenty twenty but she's also making the statement that are very much\nA contradicting what the president has said the president has called his political opponents evil he's called the press the enemy of the people in she's sticking out to a position that's a very different from that so she's trying to figure out how to stay relevant or she could pursue higher office or pursue the Senate some have said a between now and twenty twenty four\nAh but I think her political brand new is so hot that she could remain relevant throughout the next several years I have a surrogate and as a campaign supporter for not only President Trump but other Republicans who want to have a more more moderate and welcoming version of conservatism in contrast to the president\nKnows ... with Bloomberg and best phooey senior politics editor for NBC News at MSNBC thanks to

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... and we learned today that China's economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis the economy there grew six point five percent in the quarter that ended last month down from six point seven percent a year ago\nChina stock market is down thirty percent in January and the currency the yuan is falling against the dollar\nThe country's finance officials today last state media blitz to try to shore up confidence in the economy\nJoining us now is NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz Hi Rob hey Jeremy says six point five percent uh\nWe'd love that kind of growth rate in the United states in China it read news\nIt is bad news yeah six forty five percent we haven't seen that uh since two thousand\nNine and that was when the global financial crisis hit and had a pretty tremendous impact on China and the jobs in China you know there are many many jobs lost after that and uh so going back to that is not what I think China's regulators and China's bankers and China's economic planners were hoping for\nAnd so what is causing it is it mostly the terrorists from the United states well China's economy has\nBeen leg and for the last few years you know the government is dealing\nWith a lot of problem you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble in urban China and the biggest pressure on the economy comes from this historic transition that China's making to shift\nThe way that its economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and when you're the second largest economy in the world and you're managing one point four billion people that type of economic transition is pretty painful and pretty complicated and that's part of what we're seeing here\nAnd are they expecting that it's going to last for a long time this downturn or or that there'll be able to work their way out of it somehow\nWell I think that's where the terrorists come into play because we've got in the midst of a downturn we've got these terrorists from the United states and that is happening at a pretty vulnerable\nTime for China so ah when you look at both the fact that China's economy is already lagging it's ... you know markets are tumbling and its its its currency is also starting to decline pretty quickly here\nAh and then you've got these new tariffs coming for his I think that's creating a lot of psychological bears for the Chinese and it's a it's basically making people uh try to make sure up what they've got and I think the entire system is preparing for a big shock right now\nWell you mentioned the currency it hit a two year low against the dollar or this week and President Trump has been accusing China keeping the currency artificially low so when uh the currency hits a two year low is that by design or is that by accident\nYeah that's an interesting question you know the economists I talked to are dismissing this idea that China purposely weakening its currency to make its exports cheaper China used to do that but that's not really what's happening now it's happening is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger than ever thanks to President Trump's tax cuts and the feds raised interest rates in fact it's fair to say here that China doesn't want its currency to beat appreciating this fast because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nAnd what's interesting also is that China is manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what Trump is accused China of doing a sense of summer China's been trying to strengthen its currency so that it wouldn't weaken so fast so if China should stop manipulating its currency\nThe UN would weaken much faster which is what Trump does not one because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between us and China\nTo NPR's Rob Schmitz joining us from Shanghai Rob thank you [noise] ... and you're listening to hear him

object in your home is connected to the Internet from your refrigerator to your ceiling fan\nJoining us now it's been brought Johnson who covers tech for here and now when you say this may sound cool inconvenient we've talked about it before but there are some big privacy and security risks here\nAbsolutely um anything that you connect to the Internet comes with the potential good and bad the Internet offers\nSo we've seen hackers get into baby monitors and scream at babies for instance um you could imagine crazy things like thermostats going off in your pipes freezing while you're on vacation undetected break ins because you're smart locks had been hacked\nOr people turning off your lights on you a smart fridge is have given away ... credentials and payment information in the past and\nUm so the more things get connected the more creative hackers are going to get in breaking into them and it's not inconceivable that ransomware for instance where hackers take over your computer and make you pay up to access it again could make it into the smart home uh and and could really hold people hostage in their own homes\nSo this does get kind of scary in this potential future that we are talking about\nIt so what are these companies doing to help people deal with these issues [noise]\nHonestly not a lot yet um larger companies have the money to invest in security but as we saw with fifty million a Catholic Facebook being compromised just recently it's it's a bit of a crap shoot for consumers even among big companies right\nUm there's a cultural thing happening to Internet connected tech is trendy so companies of all sizes are a lot more likely to spend money on connecting something than protecting something once it's connected\nUm Facebook announced a this video chatting service or at all and this is a different issue saying they weren't going to collect user debt data\nNow the company has flip flopped saying the user data will be collected potentially hackers could get access to that and it's important to remember that connecting something on the Internet also let companies move the goalposts after you've purchased the product in a kind of unique way\nI'm so companies can change terms of service or user agreements that none of us ever read and while we're in this brave new world\nSo of course anyone could just disconnect entirely say I'm not going to have a smart home I'm not going to have the Internet have things in my home [noise]\nYeah that is true ah although it does get tricky because again a lot of these companies that are making these products are are putting the conductivity into their products without really asking the consumers right\nUm and the slow as they may be government organizations are catching up to this a better clarity on national global technology standards are would be really helpful when it comes to connected devices\nUm that could come through legislation which is difficult but seems to last longer also the Federal Trade commission has made some progress on protecting consumers' data and putting the onus on companies rather than consumers to bolster those protections\nIf the FCC updated the fines for companies are like when companies screw up that would go a long way to you\nAnd then we've also seen the European Union and European regulators um be more willing and able to exert regulatory powers over companies when it comes to data so there's something called the ... privacy regulation that is in motion now and will likely sort of go into effect late this year or early next year\nAnd that's really focused on user privacy or when it comes to the Internet of things\nA little company saying goes too far in regulating the Internet of things by making the user agree every time a sensor picks up their information for instance so\nWhat do you advise people to do if they're listening to this and they're wondering about their own privacy their own security but they also want to maybe have some of the conveniences that are offered from the Internet of things just moved to the would go\nUp and read you know I mean I you know my rule of thumb is is every time you buy something or like this ask yourself if it needs to be connected to the Internet um\nOften the answer is no right um and you know again each consumer has to decide for themselves where that line is drawn when it comes to um whether it's convenient enough to kind of make the argument to take that risk\nUm it may be that the Internet of things is coming to our home whether we like it or not but we can use our power as consumers to hopefully make smart purchases and that will then of course convince companies that either we want something or we don't\nAlso if you're supernovae idea of a smart home but don't want to be a casualty of a company's bill advise decisions about your data future self to build the thing you want so like learn how to use a and program those little or do we know computers that are uh you know at the center of all a lot of these smart devices\nTaken all smartphone connected to why stick it in your fridge figure out a way to get that video feeds securely so you can check to see
