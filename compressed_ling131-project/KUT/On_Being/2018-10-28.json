that's what would you do some of the prisoners\nTo use a composite of very low cost materials but using motives enjoys\nThe end of all of this is to achieve a very low cost practical dwelling which addresses as many of these criteria for health as possible\nAnd we can learn hopefully from the free but from the occupants to understand how the next generation of these very low cost weddings might be improved and make more livable and then stop to think about how to do that a scale\nAnd some of the low tech solutions are being child in South Africa\n... countries have employed inexpensive strategies to keep buildings cool in the heat of the day for thousands of years we've already mentioned some of them such a feeding shots as\n... and white is so common so buildings in the Mediterranean partly because it reflects heat many cities are now using reflective touching on breeze to significantly reduce temperatures\nMy name is running weapons and I'm a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory in Berkeley, California since the year two thousand five California's building energy efficiency standards\nHave prescribe the use of reflective roofs on commercial buildings the idea behind a cool roof is simple instead of putting on your building a roof surfacing material that is dark and absorbs a high fraction of sunlight\nYou simply instead choose a more reflective version of the same product it might just be a white product you may have an office building or a store\nThat has a membrane roof these are plastic swelled the membranes are available in black or gray or town or a green or white many cars out there\nThe simplest thing to do would be to choose the white version of the roof\nOn the other hand we know that there'll be many buildings where the roof can be seen from the street and this will mean that the\nBuilding's owner or perhaps the buildings architect will seek a color other than whites\nWe can do that to only about half of sunlight is visible if you want to have a reflective roofs that is not white but will still stay cool in the sun\nYou can focus on reflecting the half of the sunlight that you can see you can for example get a red roof that reflects only twenty percent of the visible light giving it it's red color\nBut at the same time reflects about sixty percent of the invisible light the end result is that you reflect about forty percent of all the sunlight in fact it's roughly doubles the solar reflections compared to a traditional red roof\nAnd just in case you're thinking what's the big deal on like the heat and wouldn't it be nice to have warmest summers especially in the u._k. where we all know about the rain and the drizzle\nHottest summers have serious consequences\nMy name is send them over again is I'm a senior lecturing sustainably building and opened design things before environmentally sign in engineering and hear the box and you see and so the problem with a heating up to the

U. T. right\nNow feels to me like the technologies that now define our lives are also waking up to spiritual technologies that route is back in our senses nearby Bush has life is a lens on that story she helped bring would have been to the west in the Nineteen seventies and she helped create Google Search inside yourself\nShe concedes that meditate or can be as narcissistic as any of us but she also reveals how the magnetism of meditation is activating contemplative impulse as at the heart of many traditions and in the thick of modern life\nWhen I began to learn various contempt litter spiritual practices meditation yoga insulin I realize that when I loved about it was that\nThey help you get calm clear open better able to hear what it is I'm supposed to be doing this my life and then doing it [noise]\nI'm Krista Tibet and discuss on being stay with us\n[noise] well that's that's really quite lovely language I'm pretty amazing story of your own at this point I have to say I mean you know digging into [noise]\nAll the things you did along the way and you ended up I'm kind of rediscovering ... I think at an in India um yes he got there though it seems to me is that ... sixties\nAnd kind of driven [noise]\nDriven to be moving and driven to search by your English at what was happening in the world and you ended up kind of on this health are meant to Nineteen sixty nine yeah I think maybe later on you called it a pilgrimage maybe at the time yeah didn't feel quite as a defined\nYeah at the time I was in graduate school from sixty seven to Seventy and um those are the years that there's so much upheaval on campus and I got really involved in civil rights and\nThen in anti war work you know I Would drive where researchers across the Canadian border I was in the\nEnglish department and they were extraordinary people and it was a time when people were beginning to to experiment with psychedelic and some spiritual practice but not so much but the whole\nCampus was just kind of turned upside down and then the politics of it meant that the police came on to campus and it was\nGetting impossible so I left just before I had done all the work for my PHD except my dissertation and then I decided to take some time off\nAnd uh I traveled overland from London to Delhi that is like\nGoing backward in time it was than before everything was so you know kind of globalized yeah and it was amazing because at that time going through you know the former Yugoslavia and Iran and Afghanistan and Pakistan and India every place was completely peaceful\nPeople everywhere took us into their homes and we took a bus from from London to definitely\nAs long as ... around the world it was two months\n[laughter] yeah I think like four hundred dollars and\nUm [laughter] uh [laughter] but it then we stopped and lots of places and got to know people all along the way and also\nGot to have some experience of their spiritual and religious practices small along the way and uh that was really opening for me and I expected to stay for two weeks maybe in India we were kind of searching for\nMeaning yeah the first week I was there I heard a course that a Burmese Buddhist teacher was offering for westerners for the first time it was\nThe very first time right to marry for westerners yeah\nAnd I did that course with many other people who are still my close friends and um there were very few westerners then I mean\nHave been the British Raj [laughter] and it was a big gap and then the U.S\n[noise] you know I think you did say that the minute of it what you discovered how you talk about what you discovered and that experience of\nA serious introduction to contemplation meditation\nFirst you know it's hard to talk about I Know and um\nBut [laughter] well the most basic thing that I could look inside myself and\nLearn about the nature of the mind and the nature of the world\nI was literature student I had read you know a thousand books probably [laughter] and I was always looking outside for more ideas and you know more critical understanding and more content we didn't call it content that [laughter]\nWe called the literature\nAnd so just looking with in was really stunning [noise] and then the first course was from five in the morning till ten at night and um [noise]\nLittle by little you know I started getting really quiet and still uh of course all kinds of things came up\nBut I really began to see that I was not my mind I was not my body I was a things but I was also awareness\nI began to see the basic nature of the permanence of thought says they rise and fall away and I started taking them less seriously it was really wonderful I felt much less dependent on\nFinding things outside and\nGave me a kind of radical self confidence like I Belong to you're on the planet\nAnd [laughter] you know and that uh I Would be able to ah understand the basics of how it's all unfolding I Would say that it also gave me kind of face in the unfolding huh I like to use the word sane\nFace that sort of felt like it felt like I had to face and actually the way things are and that that was okay\nMm\nTicket and this is on being today we married like\nBush her life it's on land on a fascinating story of our time\nBuddhist meditation made its way to the wedding and has moved into many realms of human endeavor also reviving contemplative practices in our tradition nearby Bush actually took a corporate mapped out of India from Nineteen Seventy two to Nineteen eighty five\nWith our company called elimination it made it to name with silk screened ...\nAnd other iconic spiritual symbols\nAnd made it for ten on the rainbow decals that became synonymous with the Vw beetle counter cultural American heyday\nMm\nYou know I hear you saying ... said you you had a new insight into your mind and into the world and he now does two things belong together but I feel like in your thinking and in don't work you've done bringing\nContemplative practice back out to others you've had a very focused way of tending to\nThe intersection between those two things and seems to me that you know the world that has led to share where it unfolded\nIn these forty fifty years\nOf big dynamic and it is\nTwo strains\nOf inner life fan out or action\nKind of find any other city fully [laughter] and you know you you didn't realize that you are going to be part of this you know you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids\nThen kind of really importing put him back into the west be pretty amazing to think back on it now and he\nIs I mean when I first came back I mean the idea [laughter]\nWe were so marginalized that's to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise]\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully\nAnd then share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no way should imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives and the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was ... and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in at a looming nations was integrating the sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nAll one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter] yeah\nYeah I mean well I Will put this tree of contemplative practices on line but yeah I just I just want to read you know some of them first of all the different branches they're still ... creative activist relational movements ritual cyclical and it's everything from centering to meditation to\nVisualization ... music contemplative art ... social justice work and volunteering vigils bearing witness\nDeep listening storytelling labyrinth yoga\nTai chi retreat ceremonies and rituals it opens up this study\nThat takes the idea of contemplative practice an awakening out of a box of any kind of now Fox\nYeah when we when we would share the tree or start talking about the practices with all kinds of different people almost always someone would say oh I Would contemplative practice my life you know I walked silently in the woods\nOn Saturday mornings you know or whatever it was so it the tree help people discover that and feel that it wasn't an esoteric or foreign thing and so then it would be more open to exploring some of the other practices [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOr\n\n\nAfter a short break more with nearby Bush was putting all kinds of great extras entire pod cast feet poetry music in a new feature living the questions you can get it all as soon as

being a date with nearby Bush she works\nAt an emerging twenty first century intersection at the industry social healing and diverse contemplative practices raised Catholic with Joan of arc as her hero she's one of the people who brought put us into the west from India and the Nineteen seventies\nShe's calling to work with educators and judges social activists and soldiers she helped create Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself\nNearby Bush's life tells a fascinating narrative of our time their rediscovery of contemplative practices in many forms and from many traditions in the secular thick of modern culture\nSo let's talk about where like the rubber meets the road then [laughter]\nBack down to the granny squares that really level well like I said oh I Want to talk about the ... this have you done workplaces [noise] uh-huh and this is Google but it's other places as well and you've also worked I think with social activists\nYeah a lot [noise] well I just remember this year the freshman\nAt Amherst College had they all had to choose a three day orientation in their first week of school and out of\nFour hundred entering students Seventy chose meditation and yoga [laughter] so ... is a big change and a half so I'm\nThe first day you know I was teaching them mindfulness and having them you know watch their breasts which had just arrived on campus they were and they had like worked like scenes you know to be able to\nGet ahead and do you arrive on campus yeah [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] so I left a lot of space where I'd say uh I teach the practice and then I'd say\nSo any reflections on that any questions and then be dead silence most [laughter] okay well practiced a little more and then I'd ask you know but he would make themselves vulnerable enough to ask a question right so I decided oh better\nChanges around so I I'm Sorry to give them a practice of mindfulness an object and I gave them each a leaf and\nThey were to bring their awareness to the leaf and then as distractions arose let them go and bring your mind back to your leaf [laughter]\nSo we did that for five or ten minutes which is a long time to it you know usually you look at all leave and you say oh okay I thought All right and and I didn't really expect that anybody was gonna say anything so I left a couple of moments at the end no but he did\nAnd then this one\nFootball player in the back row raised his hand and he was he had become in my mind the person who most was kind of resisting right make him so vulnerable and anyway\nHe said can I say something that Jeff ... like you said I Love my leaf\n[laughter] oh it was so beautiful yeah and then they all started talking about how you know what it was like to really look and look and look\nAnd it just made me realize that you know it's so much easier to do the things that we've done what I Know that some Christian groups called crimes against creation ...\nWhen we're so out of touch with nature and um so ... that one moment like this kind of this window into what\nNeed to remember in order to make the right decisions for the future [noise]\nIt also um you know sometimes I feel like we we shut the twenty\nFirst century and I I think of this has kind of spiritual technology right meditation and mindfulness and contemplation and yeah yeah it's almost like we like we're discovering all these other technology and then we're kind of waking up to this spiritual technology that we\nJust need to go back to our sense has almost I mean I Wonder a lot about\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and we're never you know we're always we're always engaged with our phones and I'm I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do\nAll right did we I mean you're talking about looking at a leave but I mean did we look\nAround and I mean I Know there was born I mine don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain um I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't\nAllowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like\nBreathing in and breathing out\nThree brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and about lying down [laughter] for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and move on what's sacrilegious right [laughter] right\nWell but okay so and you get all that beautiful workers Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google for for a loved that she put it in her magazine and plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it [laughter] um you just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Austin", "day": "28"}
