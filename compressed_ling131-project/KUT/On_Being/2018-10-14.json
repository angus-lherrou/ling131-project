for the light\nAfter that it's going to go hat [laughter]\nI'm ... and this is on being stay with us\n\nNon generosity our own insularity ... our own cruelty when you hear certain things coming out of your children's mouth and say why do I think it's wrong for my daughter to say she hates trouble than it's wrong for me to do it too and and we tried very hard my partner and I tried very hard during the election to say look you can\nNot like what he stands for ... uh but you don't hate him and one of my I think uh you know enjoy the story are one of my favorite moments during the election was a this package arrived at home and it was a mermaid snow ...\nMy daughter saw her name was on an open it and I come home and she is clean this thing for lice the greatest thing in her little later in life it's amazing\nAnd uh I I go to the other my part is like who sent her not in the mail like why are we getting mermaid Snuggie is at home and I said oh it's my friend Scott he no he used she's\nSomeone I'm On CNN with a minor with she's the Trump supporter I'm off and on air with\n[noise] and my daughter and obviously over heard this and comes into the room holding the mermaid Snuggie are online I like it is now poison\nAnd I said honey she's a Trump supporter and she's a good person ... and those two things are true and there are a lot of people who do not nice things were Hillary supporters like it's not the the two don't have to be don't have to go together\nAnd what's amazing is I've heard of her repeat that I heard her say Trump supporters are good people to ... and I was we can figure out how to get through this moment of what I think is really important and profound ideological wrestling\nOver what is justice look like and what is the quality of coke how do we get there and at the same time holding our hearts the aspiration of that idea which is if you believe in equality and justice than treat everyone with equality and justice while arguing about the pads and policy is to get their ...\nYeah you said uh\nThe first step\nIs starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves we need to catch ourselves and our our hateful thoughts and all their forms and all of us\nSo Eric you um you mean you have had a pretty exciting early century uh came the editor in chief of red state dot com you were involved in a Tea Party\nYou became a syndicated newspaper connoisseur drive time very popular drive time house in Atlanta um\nCasually guest hosting Rush Limbaugh\nSyndicated radio show and and do that in sixteen you were a conservative who was not supporting the Republican nominee but your year was a lot more eventually than that\nSo I as a whole bad stories began I went to a CrossFit box [laughter]\nTwenty Fifteen I'm traveling the country and the debates needed to get back in shape was out of breath all the time and it just got worse than that you know my dad told me everything went downhill at forty and I hit forty and thought did you ever they use falling apart\nShe couldn't do CrossFit couldn't keep up um it got worse but it was allergies of next thing I Know a I Am being rushed into in ICU after getting the CGI\nLiterally I got to see the skin and you know the texture exposed to tell you anything and the guy comes in ... says do I strap him down\nI just she fell out ... started to sit up and he pushes is just no you can't get off you should be did I had ... some odd blood clots in my lungs are they'd been accumulating in literally my wife couldn't be there she had to pick up the kids are we weren't expecting anything it was allergies\nAnd while I'm In the ... of course you can't get your cell phone working and I get up out of range and my phone just lights up it's my wife\nOf the Mayo Clinic could colds you had these random spots are ones that had him for years and they called and said she had to come in a shoe they refer to see people with her condition develop lung cancer and do all this happened to my wife has a very rare form of genetic a lung cancer there is no cure\nA we have all these these things happen and I had written that I wouldn't support the president\nUh we had to have armed guards at the house for three months uh and you know I'm I couldn't support him because he didn't reflect my values and I didn't think it reflected the values of the people are so who are aggressively supported him and I just felt like somebody need to say this is madness\nBut you also then set out to write this book um which it came out at the end of last year and a few thousand Seventeen when I wake it's my closet cookbook they're all\nThere there is it has yet there are relatively\nFast [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut you have to read a little while to\nGet to the cookbook um but it's less life lessons from a father to his children because what you also do in that book and I I Do want to say that you\nAlso have our on record saying that if somebody planted a bullet or your head and said you have to either vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton you would have\nTo the bullet yes so that's also who you are\nI Need to be aware by contact senator or a context and in that room in this book you also said ear you start looking at at I Do think you know this that's reckoning like what how what have I done in these last years that is on record that is on the Internet that my kids are going to read one day\nAnd I want them to understand me and a greater ... and to me that's an is yeah you you know I\nI make my living on the Internet I'm very blessed ... I've had a TV and radio studio in my house or for years thanks to the Internet um I initially got started as a writer on the Internet because I hated being a lawyer\nAnd I've increasingly become mindful of two things about the Internet one is that all of us myself included um we we can lose ourselves on the Internet and become our worst cells\nAnd then others want to define us by the worst thing we've done on the Internet or even if it was a decade ago and and probably the worst thing I've ever done ... on the Internet was a decade ago people still bring it up that you have no credibility because of this thing you did ten years ago\nAnd if none of us are allowed to move beyond the worst thing we've done there's no incentive for any of us to become a better person\nAnd I wanted to make sure my kids understood that the other thing and I see this is the most deeply disturbing thing about the Internet no one talks about in should\nUse it as allowed every single person in this room and all of us up here to ignore our physical actual next door neighbor and become friends with the next door neighbor on Facebook\nI told my kids all the time and I mentioned this is a book that Jeremiah twenty nine seven says she the welfare of the city in which you're an exile for their you will find your salvation and I really\nDo believe that means your local community are all politics is local if you don't know about the homeless man under the bridge or that your next door neighbors chicken needs food uh you're not being a good member of the American community and my kids need to understand that\nThey need to know their next door neighbor not just the people on the Internet oh\n[noise]\n\nI'm Christian tempted and this is on being today at the University of Montana with conservative commentator Eric Ericson and progressive commentator Sally calm and\n\nThat kind of thing that this phenomenon of trolls is like a a life is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that the anonymity and ending this embodied I'm\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well he said he said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter tells you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying\n\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up\nA dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq some very deep you speak humanizing latch yes\nUm and I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most yeah I'm One was um\nNo one thinks they're mean no one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just polls talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good [noise]\nBuying mark and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unconscious um and\nAnd in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio\nOn line um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still um no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be careful\nOK how do we do is that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which I was like right now but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and ready forgotten it's\nNever never ever in history has that happened [noise] um\nI Want to say to me the opposite of hate isn't love it's connection it's you have to see you don't need to love people do not hate them you have to see that you have something that your core fundamental humanity fundamental goodness\nThat transcends the division and the reason I talk about my aunt Lucy is\nThere are people who when you meet them when you know them and I talked to my trolls you realize that that were a point in our society and our history where we focus on a very small sliver of our beliefs to fight over ... and\nI don't know about you but when I see my relatives who I don't agree with on a hundred percent of ... first of all of a bunch of relatives I don't agree with on a hundred percent of political issues but I don't see them as they're still on my side because we I don't know what do we agree on you know Ninety percent of the political issues or where's the dividing line\nAt the point is when I see my aunt Lucy maybe we disagree on even more still lover\nYeah I still care about her I still know she's a good person and want what's best for me and my family and the country in the world and that is a really good place to be able to start to then talk about what we disagree on\nYou know ... when I started at CNN at the end of two thousand nine I grew up watching CNN being in Dubai ... was the new show do you watch 'em and came home joined CNN and suddenly surrounded by people who as a kid growing up interested Baltics they were the enemy\nAnd James Carville and pull the gala they got that Clinton guy elected a Donald Brazil furs up they wanted to be my best friends at CNN is still great friends with all of them are and being able to make those connections I ... a friend of mine who disagrees greatly with you on many things\nAh found out I was coming out here and he sent me a text she says you don't need to go out there\nBecause she'll come back and you'll like her [laughter]\nAmazing that when you actually\nMeet someone or ... and you learn about someone in and you learn their interests um you connect with the ... you don't own over the Internet you know I tell people all the time the the reason I'm a conservative is because I Believe we're all sinners and I want to you in charge abuse possible and\nThen I I also say you know that that's a ... exactly why but I mean this\nBy like small government of the fewer centers in charge of me I mean I've got enough sense of my own I wrote about them in the book\nUm but\nA lot of evangelicals and crew in American politics have gotten so wrapped up in their belief in an existential crisis of an assault of their culture in a salt of their religion they forgotten the concept of grace and I think all of\nUs uh whether or not you know ... whether you're a Christian most ... face cultures ... spiritual cultures have a concept of grace and I think we lose that over the Internet as we interact more and more with people who were faceless [noise] [noise]\nAfter a short break more with Eric Ericson and Sally cone [noise]\nWe've also just released a new episode only in the on being hot seat of living the question where I moved to the other side of the conversation and shorter form this
