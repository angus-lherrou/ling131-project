World Service next week for the third episode of off\nPerhaps we discuss how even globally impacts of the crisis has two tectonic shifts and political and economic power [noise]\nGood morning at five fifty nine you're with Austin's NPR station this is K.

U. T. overcast and Seventy four degrees [noise]\nShade Eric ...\nIs one of my job [noise]\nYou're listening [noise]\nLately ... is a writer a mother a citizen of the United states and a citizen of the ... nation she has a way of opening up this part of her life and if American Life\nThat inspires searching and tenderness she's the author of where as a lyrical puck that offers entry points for us all to events that are not merely about the past and to the freedom real ... my ...\nI really wanted it to be grounded and and now at least in my own lifetime\nI learned as much as possible to avoid this sort of nostalgic porch or\nMy life [laughter]\nI'm ... and this is on being with us [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nMhm [noise]\nTalk a little bit about what you avoid in the notion of ...\n... well let's say a with the whereas ... pieces\nWhich are response to the national apology yeah to Native Americans um I've often said that I felt like this was a project of constraints\nSo when I sat down to work on this response or there were a lot of constraints that I um placed on myself\nAnd one of those was that I wanted to uh all of the pieces to be written number one through first person I uh-huh um but number two all of them had to be within living memory\nI did not want to jump back a hundred years yeah that's I think so often that's really temptation yeah to do when it comes to um anything that has to do with native issues you know I'm native rights or history\nAnd so I really wanted it to be grounded in the now at least within my own lifetime and I I wanted as much as possible to avoid this sort of nostalgic porch or ... miles\nA native life or life my life\n[laughter] to me this also is an expression perhaps of this idea of\nUm of dual citizenship right [noise] um\nAnd seems to me that's where it takes on both sides of you if if I don't know if that's the right way to say like you you've written I Am a citizen of the United states\nAnd an enrolled member of the ... tribe meaning I'm a citizen of the ... the Lakota nation and in this dual citizenship I must work I must eat I missed art I must mother I must friend I must listen I must observe constantly I must live\n[noise] um\n[noise]\nHow you sons so this congressional resolution of apology to Native Americans [noise]\nHappened in two thousand nine I had never heard of it until I sat down to prepare to interview you and I don't think you heard about it at the time is that right how did you start how did you come to be ... to be trained on this\nUh yeah um\nI hadn't heard about the apology until months later I think it was ... it was signed in December of two thousand nine and it was some time in the spring I think of two thousand ten I heard about it several months later\nAnd I was personally really surprised\nThat I hadn't heard about it before part of the reason they hadn't is because it was so quiet yeah and there really was not a lot of risk taking right in how it was um delivered\n[noise] well I think it was enacted as part of the defense appropriations active do the same time which is a little confusing I'm not necessarily where we would look and you know it's interesting to me because there's a lot of\nFeel like just recently and American culture we started to entertain\nSome new kinds of language like truth and reconciliation and is that something we might talk about [noise]\nUm [noise] with Native Americans with slavery or reparations 'em or you know words like redemption um and then there is a here's tucked away is this resolution that was passed but never really\nNever spoken allowed right never really offer publicly\nRight around and just going to read a little bit because because other people I haven't heard of it I just the beginning to acknowledge\nA long history of official decorations and ill conceived policies by the federal government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to own native peoples on behalf of the United states\nIt talks about the fact that native peoples inhabited the present day nine states for housing of years\nBefore the arrival of people who've European descent that they honored protecting the steward at this land we cherish and then it says whereas whereas the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new chapter in history of if people's and then it continues to whereas whereas whereas and\nWhereas [laughter] so you discovered this and um yeah what was your reaction\nI I think well first of all what motivated me to even ...\nBond to the apology was the delivery so that's the heart of it uh-huh or I should say than non delivery of the apology yeah but then I went online and I read the apology and then I was like oh my gosh the the language it's so careful\nAlso carefully crafted and you know my goodness these guys are poets like [laughter]\nI mean very astute in very aware\nOf what each phrase how how do we sit a you know\nWhat each phrase may carry yeah the implication of each phrase and yeah so even the phrasing of um the arrival of Europeans opened a new chapter yeah for native people\nThat's crazy was in opening\nA new CIA [laughter] that's yeah that's almost poetry is very interesting way to to look at what happened right so and going further into the document um\n[noise] you know just the idea of for example um they never mentioned genocide right yeah things are phrased as conflicts um lives were taken on both\nSides and now you know young like that both took innocent lives including a woman in children [noise] you know when they do say you know the infamous trail of tears and long walk but\nYeah you're right it's very fair\nCareful right you know I mentioned this to group of students recently um the University of Washington\nBut I'll mention here as well I was watching this really nice video I'm a little talk by face spotted eagle she's I'm ...\nAnd she was the only native woman to receive a vote from the electoral college in this last um two thousand selecting election yeah [laughter]\nAh she's an amazing um beautiful woman a wonderful speaker to [noise] um and so anyway I was watching the videos little talk she was giving and she was talking about\nThe idea of discussing um history discussing some of these traumas that have happened yeah and she was saying for native people\nTalking about these things is important to process of healing\nUh-huh and for me I think it's not just feeling I Would add to that sense of justice mhm\nYou know being heard and then on the other hand she said for non native people cheering and listening to these narratives these histories yeah and engaging in a conversation that is not about guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial\nUh-huh it allows a liberation so I think that that's\nReally um maybe what was important to me in\nThis work you know and I didn't want to jump back a hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years\nUh I didn't want to jump back to wounded knee or San creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime\nThis is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right\nI'm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing um they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter]\nIn them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but in ... I was a little embarrassed just because I didn't\nWant to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um\nIs that it's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future of that is a world where creating\nOf remaining\nPrayer full of having that be ceremony no weapons mhm um and in some ways I think struggling with people who were coming to be in solidarity um but that being the position that the Standing Rock elders took\nMhm right and\nWhat should I say about that [laughter] well I'm ... I'm just curious about\nHow you are watching that have watched that um and how does it flow into this other exchange you or have you\nBeen having by way of just the thought and poetry um with the larger picture of\nThe\nDoes history and is um struggles still to reconcile this history\n[noise] um [noise] it's kinda funny um yesterday I was just I just had an interview I'm\nWith someone else um and we were talking about this idea of prayer and so it's something that I\nI Want to be really careful I'm Talking about because they certainly don't want to come across lake or some new age ... type person or\nUm some ... or something but I think that [noise] um I have a lot about 'em both at a community level and on a personal level this idea of prayer being central\nTo inability to enact even to take\n[noise] how do I call what how they see it almost want to say I'm\n\nA prayer full inaction I don't know no those are not the right words but um I think what I've been thinking about a lot is\nAt Standing Rock um\nI have a few friends there and how from\nThat community has been on on keeping prayer as central\nTo everything that they do right now um and I think that that's something very beautiful and unique ... Standing Rock has offered to the world of\nResistance and that's not to say that other movements have not had prayer in at the center of what they do\n[noise] no but\nBut you're right it's and it's I mean even that word resistance which is very much entered the lexicon right now and not very often I'm hearing about the prayer um ... in other context and the other thing about that is that\nIt was really in reading you saying this about this community taking position and remaining powerful\nI realized it was true and that had come through and what I knew but it's not prioritized in like coverage right it's not the headline [noise] um and so I think it's important for you\nTo say that like to to speak that for people to hear that too and be looking for that because I'm\nA I'm Standing Rock is going to be with us [noise]\n[noise] right and I think that yeah every movement in every community and they have their own\nCulture their own values that sort of propel\nThe action that they take right you know create new age yeah I don't know if many people are aware aware of how important prayer is to walk hotel life mhm but I always get a kick out of it I had a nephew who is own\nComplaining to one of my cousins my sister and he was saying\nOh it's hard to be called to all we do is pray pray pray all the time [laughter] food [laughter] and and\nYeah I just got a kick out of that so you know it is is a very real thing yeah and so it is something that um I have really appreciated\nIn loved ...\nSeeing how that really um influence every step that the community took I felt\nAnd it's something that I've heard from people who were who went up to Standing Rock it was why I think so many people had a good experience there because there was that prayer in that sense of connection that community um and and\nAll kinds of religious figures all kinds of religious leaders also gathering around with their prayers\nYeah ultimately yeah [laughter] I don't know how you\nFeel about the language of Native Americans spirituality but if I find a dangerous\nI worry about it being thrown around and be on I mean is seeing actors and the thing yeah [noise]\nI mean listen the thing is is there are over five hundred and sixty federally recognized tribes and that's just federally recognized there are many more that are not recognize who are many of them right now or are seeking recognition but the point is\nIs um all of us are different in all of us have um I'm\nBeliefs and ways that are particular to who we are as a people so you know ... to um beliefs are very different than let's say\nWhere I live here in the southwest from ... some of my friends from Santa Clara Pueblo let's say or Hopi friends or didn't ask friends you mean all of us are our traditions and\nWays are all so so different you know our stories and\nAnd they're also so connected to the land yeah that we come from there's there's not a separation it's connected yeah so\nNative American spiritual idea is to awful term it yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah scary is so broad and yeah yeah abstract\nYeah and it can be very very superficial and out of context raise I think one of the most\nStriking just sentences that I've read or heard in the context of what's going on the Standing Rock as\nA ... one of The Elders are maybe the maybe the chief saying\nNo water is not a resource it is a source of life mhm\nAnd that is a state matter of fact right yeah I mean and it's just we never it's not a way we say it or think about it and it's such an ... the whole drama really is such an interesting ah\n[noise] I mean it's so many things but in in you know and and if you look at that sentence it's I'm an amazing testament to the power of how we formulate and understand\nHow something like what if water right [laughter] and how a word like resource that gets thrown around and I throw it around all the time to like crazy it's like one of the big words now can dehumanize us and be away into\nInto belittling\nYeah I've sort of live [laughter] I yeah I mean you know all of these things for [noise] first of all I really I I feel like I have to oh constantly put out disclaimer Z mhm um before I ever talk on some of these issues\nBecause you know I I just I'm so wary of of sounding like I'm Talking for for all ... people and and all native people and I'm certainly not an expert\nOn any of these issues but it is again it goes back to this idea of relationship and seeing it in that way I mean even just\nFor example one of my friends\nPosted something really funny on\nFacebook this morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um ... what was I think red will oh this is the season for getting ready to ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more\nThan you need and leave\nThe plant allow the plan to stay alive\nFor the next ... the next year rate\nSo it is always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive this awareness right I'm\nDownloading a sensibility huh of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer your right something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right in the same place horse to water and the source of life [noise]", "year": "2018",
