not that these diverse voices on out there it's just that they're not necessarily actually being listened to by those in power\nI Do think the way that knowledge is sort of a sudden they cannot make ... and she knows this gauge I Believe we're not diversified enough it and I think you do not find economists some African countries ...\nThey get in and work is hack cutting till the way we are trying to change the profession and I'm I really like to see that happen you don't publish they pass you don't find many and money to support economic thing canine changes\nThat isn't going to developing countries as much as it does because things can than other places\nYou know that's the case of landing\nIn his left leg so if we want to pick\nA new way and new paradigms and the way of thinking in that profession then we have to diversify the surface of knowledge\nShould continue depending on the same old stuff is\nSo I think we should try to get more we met in Moffett 'cause they didn't want people from low income countries that developing countries\nAnd tried to scale that thinking on how economics needs to approach issues of poverty and inequality\nWendy college degrees have important change can be driven by ensuring that economics includes a wider range of voices with different perspectives\nWe need ... much more diverse group of\nResearchers in economics and teaches and mental is more diversity ... will shift the balance of the topics that are chosen for research it will give us much more talent to make it very plain\nAnd I think there's every reason to think that the subject will become even more vibrant even more\nPromising as a way of taxing the really big problems that we face\nSince the financial crisis there's been a healthy soul searching in economics a

about the importance of\nUnions and the importance of having a relatively high wages send it it's it really has changed I definitely think that's the consequences of the crisis end of the discussions that we've had in the last ten yes\nHaving worked with the obesity the organization for economic cooperation and development I can vouch for this progress which is also reflected in the IMF work on the inequality and it's and the bank of England's welcome climate change\nI've seen firsthand how much economics has changed since two thousand image new perspectives different ways of teaching and far more of a move towards understanding how crushes come come about\nThe good news is that there's been some progress the bad news is that this is not filtered through what is done in the financial sector will impact on policy may because\nI Believe that the best way to make sure those in power over hold their ideas about economics is for us all to get involved\nThis was saying economics is too important to be left to the economists all more confident that economics as a matter of our daily bread wrong and something belonging to men in suits we'd we'd be better able to smell Iraq when something's too good to be true such as being offered a mortgage when we can't afford to pay its\nBut many people think of economics as very complex and the wrong the remote subject how can we come back and encourage people to get stuck in to improve our economic literacy\nJust like the statistics will politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn this means we can better understand the world around us and we'd be better informed and more able to speak out about big national decisions such as regarding migration and trade\nWhen do you call them as citizens across the whole range of jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide much broader basis of understanding so that when something new chance up like the threat of trade was then the kind of resonance the idea that somehow that they had been tried was before that they hadn't had serious economic consequences\nIn the Nineteen thirties that can have a resonance with people with a broader public\n[noise]\nMy hope it's a great economic literacy will make our government's more accountable for economic decisions they take which impact on our lives\nImproving economics will only make a difference between those in power take notice all through it's not as if nobody saw the two thousand have crushed coming\nMany economists alone economist says the housing

Berkeley\nShe is wide about the role emotion plays on every side of our life together and caring Sharon mindset is not the same as capitulate ...\nDoesn't mean that you're ... see that's a misunderstanding especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over not at all this means being emotionally in town\nThat's right we all need to be makers you want to make a social contribution help build a public conversation you have to really be good at a emotional attachment contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nI'm good to tip it and this is on being stay with us\nUh that's not new but I found that this important foundational reality of our feelings um\nWe didn't have a language a way of a conceptual I think that was useful and so I'm certainly three decades ago [noise] uh the idea was that either you were thinking\nWhere are you are in the ocean lower today I feel right and so I thought this wrong about that because when you're emotional you you are seeing the world in a particular way and you have thoughts\nAbout the way you see it you know you are thinking\nAnd when you're rational me take the stock exchange or people are making quote rational decisions about\nA by cell buys stocks on the stock exchange they're\nExcited that related they're depressed their emotional so these two are intertwined in ways we\nHave not careful you understood so yes it's a lead me to be come extremely interested in emotion in managing emotions evoking emotions in suppressing emotions\nIn daily life and work so I got interested in that\nI mean you're shining a light at some point yes it and we don't have a language for it but also especially in the late ... century I think we don't we don't know how to take a motion seriously\nBut I think this is such an important statement you make that um you know that Iran's author I used to work that also we think the other side as being emotional and we are not ... they're really important realization is that we are all that this is a piece of how we are all and happening among\n[noise] that's right [laughter] that's right exactly\nYeah and then it's social right that's ... that's one of your bank points that that this line between our private emotional lives and social realities is is that acknowledging that is just being or ... kind of like being in the world as it is and not as we fantasize that should be\nRight right [noise]\nUh in my latest book a strangers in their own land I got very interested in something called the deep story yeah which is a way of thinking about emotion\nI live in long taught sociology a at Berkeley in California which is a blue state does you know blue down\nHard and [laughter] and\nIn two thousand eleven I realized that already the\nCountry was falling apart that were increasing divide between Democrats Republicans left right and then I didn't understand those on the right and\nThat I was in a bubble [laughter] so I turned to get out of my bubble and come to know people uh that were as far right as Berkeley, California was a time and\nTo try and climb when I called and empathy wall a to permit myself a great deal of curiosity about\nThe experiences and viewpoint to people that I knew I Would have differences with and it\nTurned out to be an extraordinary experience it took me five years of really getting to know people asking you know where they were more with our school was what role they sat in in school\nWhat's your favorite thing to do was rather um ancestors were buried and of course going fishing with them a course really getting to know the em I came up with this idea of a deep story as a way of getting to emotion [noise]\nSo that was a phrase you used before that the deep story no narrative has felt right such an important so how would you start to tell you though is that how would you start to tell the story a part time as you inhabited it well that experience\nWhen I came to a seal and ... is that um both left and the right have different deep stories [laughter] so what is a deep story a deep story is um [noise]\nWhat you feel about a highly salient situation that's very important to you you take fat out of the deep story you take a moral precepts out\nOf the deep story it's just what feels true and I think we all have deep stories what ever our politics\nUm but there are not a fully aware of them that their dream lake and ah are told through metaphor and the metaphor for the right wing deep story that I describe been strangers is that you're waiting in line\nFor the American dream that you feel you very much to sure if it's like\nA waiting in a pilgrimage and the light line isn't moving then has ... or fear tired you feel you are properly deserving of this real bored that's a hat and the idea is you don't begrudge anyone right right okay this in this\nRight deep story don't begrudge anyone or not a hateful person but you see then the second moment of the right wing deep story somebody cutting had a few\n... why are they getting special treat and then in another moment [noise] uh the president of the country rock bottom up who should be tending fairly all waiters in line [laughter] seems to be waving to the line cutters and he in fact\nIs he alive cutter\nThe idea and how did his mother she was a single mother not a rich woman afford Harvard education lumpy education something fishy madam that was the thought there and so in the final moments\nSomeone from the cos someone highly educated someone from that so called elite\nTurns around and uh if you're really close to the prize or they have the price but they turn around and look at the other two are waiting in line\nAnd a ... oh you backward southern ... educate to races around ... a homophobic rent and then that is the strange thing to\nThat in Salt ah [noise]\nAnd then they felt like strangers in the early ... and they would say one man told me I live\nYour metaphor another one said you read my mind uh another one said no you have it wrong that the people are waiting line or paying for the line cutters and that's why we're in rage and others oh look we leave that line we succeed in getting another leader\nAh so they gave you write for accounting yeah let you can see ... it's my effort to get at feeling yeah and how detached it can be come from fat\n[noise] synch recently I I think a lot about and to me this comes through in\nYou talking about um the deep story cars and that and as you said the fact that facts and moral ... a rise out of ... actually have these take some milk shake them out or they\nMove them from it right about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a Phelps true yeah and when I went back and forth between Berkeley and and the people I came to know and really respect and\nThe other world of the south I'm south with with the ana\nI came to to realize that if they were different truths you different truth yeah so\nThere are fat so I Believe in the reality is that yes the deep story and again we all have the story um it ... Powell certain facts that don't fit it\nAnd it invites other facts that do\n\nI'm Krista ... and this is on the today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion or the whole show\n\nYou an strangers on their own land um take up what\nYou call it the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics any talk of the great paradox and um you know you point at this dynamic that in the\nThe five years she spent between Berkeley, California and southwest Louisiana while writing her two thousand sixteen book strangers and they're on land\nHas given her singular insight into current political and social dynamics we started out speaking about your your work in sociology and your focus on the sociology of emotion and and taking emotions\nSeriously which I really it's hard for me to imagine anybody could argue that emotion does and in fact seriously matter in politics now\nBut you know and then there's a an obvious extension of that here which is that we need emotional intelligence right I mean that's what mediation too and we need to say this is important as all of our other forms of intelligence that we that we we'll yet that we will very confidently and\nBoldly yes absolutely you could say that much of my work done nine books now has been an effort one way or another to honor and try and get\nThe world to honor the importance of emotional intelligence as especially is used by service workers you know caregivers childcare workers elder care workers\nUm who anybody in the service industry is using emotional intelligence and it matters enormously that we all learned to do it well\nAnd don't sneer at it [noise] um yeah a lot in fact see\nIs that really the crust of society is very thin you know it needs to be kind of needs water in the sun and nurture is so that uh it's not as brittle as it has now become an American I don't know\nOur life together needs caregiving [laughter] yes I also feel that we actually possess more\nIntelligence about how to be in a relationship across to where different as president and were true misunderstanding shut them a lot of intelligence about that in our family\nYes we do and you know when I sat out\nOn this odyssey people would I got two kinds of responses which were very interesting one was oh I couldn't do that I'd be so mad you know those people are wrong\nAnd the other one was oh you're going where you're going in central right oh no they wouldn't say it but the kind of facial expression will will maybe you're pretty right here so\nThe only way you're going to an enclave in which you will be embraced as similar\nWhat was missing from those two responses was the idea that you can be exactly who you are yeah band take your alarm system off climate and the wall and we get to know people\nOn the other side of it and I don't and then I got two oh you must be especially empathic no not at all in fact you know I think we're all\nActually extremely good at it the only thing is we don't apply that skill that knowledge to getting to know the author or wherever we defined as uh-huh\nThat's the only thing different I did\nYeah I notice that I Know I 'cause I I look at and we're at a number of interviews that were done interviews you gave\nAnd have given a ... number of uh especially about saving progressive um interviewers they liked the remark was great punishment on your kindness kind of how could you be so kind\nAnd it in in a way it kind of models kind of direct more in right they that\nRight [laughter] to kind of food right just right right right you do it\nSomebody said asked so after Charlottesville now that we've seen that\nYet how can you talk to these people and\nYeah and and I to me another great paradox engaging difference which is you describe right as you said it's not about going in and saying change my mind I Want to be Republican\nRight our I Want to join the dean Ari or for or expecting them to because engage with huge a you know I I Want to I Want to be at Berkeley why didn't [laughter]\nI'm see I haven't changed your politics and what you said and and I think this is true and I know you've seen as a sociologist across\nAll kinds of like meaningful encounter with your friends you said in large me as a human being\nRight right it did it did and uh to be able to imagine myself into a a different heart [laughter] one man told me you know look we have\nSimilar mines and we have similar hearts but we have different soles\nI don't think so interesting and so I sent to him [laughter] thank you for saying that um would you be a coal sociologist with me and figure out how the soles are different and he looked at me so scratch just said well I'm not sure\nWhat I Do what you mean [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah\nYou know this empathy thing um another wonderful encounter a was with a\nGospel singer who was sitting across the table at a meeting of Republican women of southwest Louisiana\nAnd she said oh I Love Rush Limbaugh [noise] well I first thought oh my goodness [laughter] oh and then I thought\nWonderful I his chance for me to get larger here\nSo I sent her could we meet sometime this week for some sweet peas and and you can explain what you\nWhat you love Rush Limbaugh and she said yeah sure so the next day we're meeting for sweet peas and she explains ... love Rush Limbaugh because he hates\nSeminar sees I thought oh my goodness oh ... so I ask what what is a feminine ... well it's a\nIt's a feminist to you know done like children doesn't want men cook and uh she goes on to our mental wacko ... you know there's people that aren't regulate us to death and\nAfter I'm asking her she stopped me and says I'm\nYou've told me that you uh come from the other side is a is it hard for you to listen to me\nAnd I told her actually it's not hard at all I have my alarm system off and you were I'm learning about you and you were doing is such a big favor to share your thoughts on what counts I a grateful I Am and then she says\nTake your alarm system off I Do that too she says I Do it my kids I Do ... and I thought you know okay we'll start with no yeah little common ground\nFor me in fact do that all the time because I was gonna say what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it's habit we have in in the other player I reached out at work right because you can't just blurted out well how you really feel about what someone fed at every moment\nOf oh no they're rules about that there should be some kind of a ground rules social life yeah yeah yeah one thing I found get really\nBetter at it than than we are so that's a great invitation yes doesn't mean that you're ...\nSee that's the misunderstand the I think yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over a ... a ... not at all no mhm no not at all huh just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed a way of talking\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh identities pushing it too yeah shifts counterproductive\nIt is counterproductive and sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points right that might be made I I Want to see you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of a larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution and help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day in order to do that you\nHave to really be good at a demotion management [laughter] you know they get it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good\nAnd bad ... ... ...\n[noise] I'm ... and dishes on being today with the steamed and sociologist of emotion barley hawk shelled",
