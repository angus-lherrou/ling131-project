recognition she thought\nWhy it is not my husband and he knows the highest seen it\nWas no astonishment in her she would have thought perhaps thirty seconds before that such a thing was impossible but since it was now clearly possible surprise wouldn't have been meaningless some other emotion was necessary but she found at first only\nReferral manifestations of law and her heart was beating

caught up with her and she knew what it was\nIt was relief\nI'm Glad you came she said she went over and put her head against his shoulder it was hard to say hello in the station\nShe set

client there was nothing that needed saying for the rest of the day she was happy\nThere was a constant delight in the relief from her weight of fear and unhappiness it was\nPure joy to know that there was no longer any residue of suspicion and hatred when she called him John she did so to me really knowing that he participated in her secret amusement\nWhen he answered her civil either was she thought an edge of laughter behind his words they seemed to have agreed sober lead that mention of the subject would be in bad taste might even in fact in danger there pleasure\n[noise] they were hilarious at dinner and John would not have made her a cocktail but when she came downstairs from putting the children to bed the stranger met her at the\nFoot of the stairs smiling up at her and took her arm to lead her into the living room where the cocktail shaker and glasses stood on the low table before the fire\nHow nice\nShe said happy that she had taken a moment to brush her hair and put on

little marred by the fact that he had given her a martini with neither ... nor onion it was the way that she preferred her martini and yet he should have not strictly known this but\nShe reassured herself with the thought that naturally he would have taken some pains to inform himself before coming\nHe lifted his glass to her with a smile he is only here because I\nAm here she thought\nIt's nice to be here he said he had then made one attempt to sound like John in the car coming home after that\nHe knew that she had recognized him for a stranger see it never made any attempt to say words like coming home or getting back and of course she could not not without pointing her live she put her hand and he is and lay back against the sofa looking into the fire\nBeing lonely\nIs worse than anything in the world\nShe said you're not lonely now are you going away not unless you come to and they laughed at his parody of John\nThey sat next to each other at dinner she and John had always sat at formal opposite ends of the table asking one another to politely pass the salt and butter\n[noise] I'm going to put in a little set of shelves over there he said nodding toward the corner of the dining room it looks empty here it needs things\nSymbols like\nShe'd like to look at him his hair she thought was a little darker than John's and his hands were stronger this man would build whatever he decided he wanted built\nWe need things together things we like both of us small deli kids pretty things um I agree\nWith John ... she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea of but with the stranger she said we'd have to look for them\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said like\nA little tiny man totally colored old purple\nAnd blue and gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\n[noise] much later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was radiant she had no conscience\nHe went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the present the subsidy for doing the things that John always did\nElection day is November sixth but at the midterms are already here

behavior\nMoran Ireland reads yoga oh God was lack of [noise]\n... one short\nEndocrinology one long emergency room one short\nI take a lab coat from the mountain of dirty ones on the floor and I checked the pockets I read out the size and the name of the department written and magic marker on the back of the color and then toss it in the cart\nShe sits next to me riding down each coat and the register so that next week when they come back from the laundry we can check them against the list to be sure nothing's missing of all the jobs we secretaries at the hospital have to do this is the one we hate the most\nPartly because it's nasty and boring but also because the laundry room is next to the morgue\nShe and I take an old freight elevator to the basement just a cold rattling box really and then walk\nDown the long haul that's so tired I don't see how they roll the gurney is through the walls or stuffed up and the fluorescent light flickers ...\nThe floor of the halls slopes down from the elevator so the laundry cart roles forward on its own as though pulled by an invisible hand\nLike it's going to race down the hall and crashed through the door of the morgue that's creepy to\nTo be honest the morgue doesn't scare me much I don't really understand why the other girls are so afraid of it they see people dying all over the hospital while they type their reports or eat cream puff send the lounge\nThe job is even kind of knife especially when she's next to me she's a beautiful underground as she is in the office her face all white and pale\nDermatology too short cardiology one long oral surgery one short no matter how long we work the mountain never seems to get any smaller\nHe shouldn't be in the end do lab this afternoon she says without looking up and ... right I agree it's Monday\nI Know the whole schedule by heart I can manage here if you want to go no she says running her finger down the list oral surgery no need\nHer boyfriend is a resident and respiratory medicine and right about now he's probably putting an end just go down someone's throat I pick up the next coat turned it inside out and shake it\nSomething falls out of the pocket and rolls across the floor a dried up plum\nLooks like a testicle\nI've given up trying to figure out how this stuff gets in their pockets and\nThis isn't even the weirdest thing I've seen flower\nBulbs bras corks a Bible a little egg plant condoms you name it he was supposed to come see me last night but\nHe never showed up she says maybe one of his patients took a turn for the worse I say tossing the plum and the trash he went to see his in laws to tell them about the divorce\nHe said he'd come and tell me how it went the doctor's wife went home to her family last month to give birth to their third child first girl I knew all the details [noise] he\nWas full of excuses again something about the train getting stuck in snow he claimed never even got there that he sat on the train the whole time and had to come back without seeing them can you believe the nerve he expects me to believe a story like that with the cherry trees already in bloom\nI don't know I say he couldn't be telling the truth freak snowstorm happened you should check the weather report if he was going to lie to you he would have said it was a patient she doesn't seem to be listening since the day I started\nMy job at the hospital I've always enjoyed working with her\nShe's a hard worker and she doesn't take brief from the doctors or anyone else and she's beautiful I never get tired of looking at her I must be nice being that pretty I especially like to watch her work away her eyes light up in front of the computer screen that cute little ear that sticks out from under her hair when she answers the phone\nBut best of all his tongue when she's licking those blue airmail envelopes flicks out on waste and read it runs over the glue edge\n\nI wouldn't mind having a peek down one of those scopes I say just to make conversation she nods but she's still not listening to the next coat has blood stains I Wonder whether the patient suffered much before I toss it in the car\nThey used one on me when I was a kid I add a peanut went down the wrong to when I couldn't breathe nearly suffocated so weird that one peanut could kill you\nShe doesn't answer so I go back to reading labels the rooms smells like death and disinfectant [noise] the two of them have been doing it all over\nThe hospital and the war the labs the broom closet\nMaybe she's even put the end of scope down her throat [noise]\nBut she looks as good inside is out warm red inviting all those little wrinkles tempting you deeper and deeper [noise] she knows exactly how she wants a job to be done\nTwenty pages or fewer gets a paper clip more than twenty a binder clip sugar packets are for staff meetings sugar cubes for gas\nThe surgery schedule is expected to be blown up a hundred and fifty percent and copies posted on the bulletin board upper left hand corner on the side of the equipment locker and on the door to the lounge if a patient gives you cookies or other food it goes on the middle shelf in the cupboard\n\nNot long after I started working here some big wig in neurology asked us to help with a presentation he was going to give it a conference\nAnd all these graphs and charts and he wanted it back in just two days she split the work with me and we typed up labels for this live use the number five only stickers for the slides she told me there for conferences number five oh wait was adult gray\nI did the job just the way she asked but when the doctor return to pick up the presentation he took one look at it and threw it back on the desk it all tumbled down onto the floor this color won't show up on the projector he said I'm terribly sorry she said stepping in before I had the chance to say anything or apology was really smooth\nI told her to use number six oh wait as usual but it's my fault for not checking she's new and I think she's a little colorblind I'm very sorry we'll get it done by the end of the day\nThe doctor said he'd be back later and stormed out colorblind for a moment I wasn't sure what she said just that she sounded really charming when she said it\nNumber six oh wait was bright blue she had\nDefinitely told me number five oh wait I knew because it was the same number as her apartment I wasn't likely to make a mistake about something like that\nAnd she had given the presentation one more passed before the doctor had come to get it\nI started picking up the papers it's your mistake she said you fix it I didn't finish until way after midnight I felt like I was thinking and some kind of grace swamp\nThe next morning she handed the new slide to the doctor as if she'd done them herself he seemed really embarrassed he made such a fuss and he asked her out to lunch to apologize I was not invited\nI never said a word of what happened not to anyone I was willing to be colorblind if it would keep her perfect\nI told you she got pregnant just what he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets thought of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of ... evil scheme\nShe isn't looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor\nWhen I asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses [laughter] they're worried about the boy getting into the right elementary school his wife had go into premature labor he's got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow a lot of crap\nShe stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes a down in the register I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Selected Shorts", "city": "Austin",
