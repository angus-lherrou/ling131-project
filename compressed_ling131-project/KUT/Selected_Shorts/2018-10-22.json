{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "I talked to the head nurse on the phone and I said listen I'm a man and I'm I'm coming in to give birth in her hospital and it is my expectation that you will make sure that I'm treated with integrity by every single\nPerson that comes into my room doctors nurses midwives the person who comes to change my trash\nI Want them to understand what they're walking into 'cause I Can't deal with that on top of dealing with this and she said I got it and she did\nAnd every single person that I worked with at the hospital was amazing and this was there and my dad came down from Canada to be there and my mother in law\nAnd it was two days of labor which is called labor for reason it's\nHard work but then before I knew it they're putting the syrups up and telling me oh it's gonna be time to push to and like not a big deal and I realize I have learned everything about pregnancy but nothing about actual childbirth\nMy brain flashes to a book sitting on opened on my bedside table [noise]\nIt's called prepared to push [noise]\nI have not read it I was not prepared to push I start I'm hyperventilating panicking I turned ... and I say I'm so sorry but I'm not I I Can't do this and not strong enough I turn to the midwife and I say I'm going to die\nShe is not phased by this she is sort of a four [noise]\nI guess I'm and she she bends down and gets nose to nose with me and she says you are doing a\nGood job the best job\nNo one on earth is doing as good a job as you are right now [noise]\nAnd this was like a magic spouse [noise]\nI realized I could do this and I held his hand and I hope my dad's hand\nAnd I pushed and pushed as hard as I could and at one point I looked down and there's just goose bumps all over my arms and all over my legs and\nThen I don't know what's going on but I start shooting all over everyone in him because I'm\nCanadian I started apologizing to everyone\nUp on them while I'm In labor [noise] um but eventually they started screaming at me to to slow down and and stop pushing just pushing teeny tiny bits and everyone is yelling and there's all this noise\nAnd then everything stops there's this wet slurping sound and then he's out\nAnd they hold my baby up in the light and he's listening like all those movies you ever saw and he opens\nHis mouth and he left his first cry and his voice echoes through me and\nAll of that hope that I thought I lost it all comes rushing back because a baby means hope it means you believe there will be tomorrow that the world is good enough for your child and they put him on my chest and he feels like a baby bird\nAnd before he Leon Riley running to meet their baby brother I looked down at him and his ten fingers and toes and and a full head of a black released here just like me\nAnd that's when I realized he could've been a monster he could have had two heads and a fork tongue and the tail and I would have loved him just the same [noise]\nTo me he would have been perfect thank you\n[noise]\nWas very brief pictures of printing pregnant and then with the baby and with best and the whole family visit the mom and dad or\nMy book would tend to get some more details about his extraordinary story and I asked him what it's like to be alive at a time where so many boundaries are changing\nYeah I mean I Hope that we're evolving as as human beings and I know that uh\nYou know my my mum actually when I was pregnant to bumped into a friend of hers or who's also in her seventies and living in Canada and the woman was kind of jokingly saying something about a dysfunctional family and my mom thinks that she's gonna wind up her friend and says oh you think that's crazy my son is pregnant\nAnd instead of being totally shocked and dismayed as my mother expected the woman's eyes just totally filled with tears and she was like Janet isn't it amazing that we've lived to see this world where anybody can be whatever they most want to be\nAnd and that's what I sort of like to imagine is not that things are changing\nBut that opportunities are opening up and doors are opening up that have been closed for people like me for a millennia\nDo you find that people make assumptions because you are because you gave birth to the baby that you have a more maternal role and is that even is that an offensive question even I don't\nKnow no it's not I mean I think that it's it's like totally healthy to be curious about the way that rolls play out in any eligibility family because I think a lot of people were born into the assumption that moms do a certain thing and dads are men to a certain thing and for us we've kind of taken all those puzzle pieces and\nShaking them up and then made something completely new so I work fulltime I I'm more of the like traditional like breadwinner role so even though I carry them gave birth to Leo I work and ... who did not give birth to him these home full time and is that sort of front line parent for all three of our kids\nAnd what tips you have for people who are welcoming trans people into their lives or recognize them for the first time\nI mean so I was so many but I think the the primary thing I Try to teach allies as like\nSometimes someone feels like their goal as an ally is to like not offend someone and I feel like you you're going to fail if that's your goal only because it is still so difficult to be trans in America today that whether you mean to or not you're probably going to step into something that for us\nThere's like a big well of hurt there I think if I don't like a bruise you don't have to hit a bruise very hard for it to really hurt\nSo for me like your goal as an ally shouldn't be oh I don't want to offend you um your goal should be the kind of person where if someone says hey I don't like that or I use this word instead or that really hurts me that you can be the kind of person I was like oh I'm so sorry tell me what I should say instead and that's it you know that you're not super defensive\nUm that you don't try to turn it back around on them or sell yourself in a ...\nPray and we're all of a sudden we are trying to make you feel better for some reason like don't do that just be that kind of person that can say oh I'm so sorry what can I Do instead is that's like my number number one tip be open be curious and and be wrong and have that be OK\nWords of wisdom for all of us from Tristan read you can get more advice and follow the exciting adventure family find out how the mom and dad Oregon Medford it's all over the map

[noise] I knew what they want\nI mean it'd be like them to pray with them\nSometimes in the vans they called mitzvah mobiles and once ominously and the black box of a U Haul truck\nThey wanted me to go to synagogue to become kosher\nSaddam and every morning to refrain from tearing toilet paper on friday night because every way we're secular Jew they rescued every last\nSo they pulled in back into biblical time brought them aside as a rival closer\nMy first reaction when I heard of them was fear maybe it's genetic five thousand years of conditioning\nBut when anyone even an old rabbi yells Jewish man Jewish man [noise] at me on the street my instinct is to take off running instead I just shake my head and it's got to read by\nIf it happened a lot like when I had that temp job on Wall street and get annoyed and cocky and say things like not today I'm not [noise]\nOr once searing down a guy younger than me dressed in a Belgian ... inside locks yeah I'm Jewish why you got a problem with Jews [laughter]\nBut this is LA and though I was living in the Fairfax district\nThe hot spot for old Jews were more familiar modern old juice\nSon worshipping juice with leather reach tens and bright warm up suits\nPiloting huge old categories or standing on line with me at cancers deli buying cheesecake and this over bright a historical world it felt especially bizarre almost dream like walking in flip flops to the Chevron gas station for a late lunch\nTo be way late by a tiny old ready and asked in a high fairytale voice\nAre you Jewish\nBut one thing nobody ever walked but me\nNothing moved on the streets of cars and the occasional cat\nAnd no one war long black coats and hats\nAnd no one sounded like this or if they did I didn't know it because unlike in New York no random stranger ever ever spoke to me here so the sudden appearance of this little fellow when his ... brown eyes is critical brown rump all of a face like a supermarket bag bold up\nAnd then allowed to have unfold on its own [noise]\nHis wife Santa beer than black cat his hand talking at my sleeve actually touching me well\nIt was like meeting all Afrikaans or an elf or one of those other happy\nBut miss GPS characters that materialize before wanders along the path\nI decided to play it safe no I'm not Jewish\nI said sorry\nDon't be sorry he trailed in a little accent from beyond the pale is not so great believe me [laughter]\nI smiled and turned to go but he doesn't let go of\nMy sleep I son has his hand was actually very fine sauce and wide as a girls I Wonder friend he's saying that you do me a little saver\nWhat is it I smiled warily how does this go wrong\n[noise] do you know what it means a shop is going\nI did but I didn't think that a gentile\nShould [noise]\nNot really I said then added cleverly I think I Know what a going\nIs so ... which is the center of a Jew cannot do many things he cannot drive or handle money or use machinery like for instance switch on the lights or the air conditioning or even the also\nI was going to ask why not but just not\nWhat the answer for giving me that would make it any clearer God says so [noise]\nSo he continued for these things we have a friend\nA gentile friend who was kind enough to help us a little but today my friend disappears unfortunately he's a bit of a drinker you want me to turn on your lights no no we cannot ask someone else to do what we would not\nBut maybe if you came to ... just to visit and you saw it was getting dark [noise]\nYou might turn them on for yourself [noise]\nOf course to such a friend we also like to be nice if he stops to visit friday night and again Saturday morning then later in the week we make him a present say fifty dollars\n[noise] what time Saturday morning eight\nI don't know the thing is I'm usually busy on Saturday is Seventy five [noise]\nPlus you are doing a mitzvah\nYou fix me a gentle smile is soft eyes seems ready to melt but the pinch in my sleep tightened suggesting I had little choice and I was broke\nSure I said I'll help\nThis is cash right I have a tax thing happening of course\nHe pressed my hand happily between his cool plum palms I knew when I saw you that you were a good boy\nI was actually a bit reluctant to go with him despite the money\nHigh around her neck but even those ...\nCouldn't hide the fact that there was a live girl underneath I sense the spread of her hips the tiny ways with a blouse tucked the push of her breasts against the ... fabric\nHeart was speeding and their her head was about to me early with the hair piled on top of it but\nI could see a graceful year and a part of a tale name like a slice of moon behind the cloud of lace\nThere you are a rabbi said then this is my daughter Leah\nNice to meet you I held up my hand\nLeah glass her father quickly and then briefly touched my hand\nI realized that maybe I made a mistake she wasn't supposed to touch a math but hadn't wanted to be rude blessing she looked at that may\nArise what brown but darker than her father's\nLess sad and with a gleam that however shy lashes met and challenged my gym blues\nThere was a moment of awkward silence and then the rabbi cleared his throat a glance around the ... are you ...\nWhat oh yeah I've said mind if I turn off the air conditioning [noise]\nThe rabbi groans and Leah laugh the small wild giggle\nA bird flattering out of my hands rise flickered once between two beats\nOf their lives as I ran downstairs switches I heard the rabbi shout good night I left\nEarly for ... lawn sprinklers were throwing a glow in the grass but no we moved the leaves and I could see it was going to be another killer day I unlock the door and turned on all the lives I got the AC going then I took my book instead on the steps to make sure I wouldn't\nMiss Leah but I couldn't read my mind\nRaced\nSurging ahead of the lines\nAt last she came rocking off the path holding her ... father by the elbow\nIt was unclear who was supporting whom I quickly kicked the mask cigarette butts had accumulated into the shrubbery and smiled\nGood morning I called Shabaab show alone the rabbi answered\nLeah said nothing\nPunch in the heart but when the rabbi went in she lawyer it out front turning her close ties to the sun I grab the chance to study her face trying to sort of every detail for later\nWhen she disappeared again behind the screen or skin was astonishing there were no splashes or marks\nOnly a blending from milk to pink to deep rose\nHer hair was a liquid he black and each curl seemed to be alive\nGrowing twisting right then I realized how long it had to be coiled up like that if she let it down how low it fall to the smaller back\nTo her hips\nShe opened her eyes and caught me staring I fled back down to my book\n\nWhat are you reading a poetry anthology Keats actually I'm up to keep\nWho's Keats who is key\nI blurted loudly and caught myself in a rush I told\nHer everything I knew about chief how he was self taught really working class and died of TV at twenty five broken bereft in Rome oh he wrote all his greatest works and only twelve months and then that brief flash burns himself into the heart of English literature\nHe wrote some of the most beautiful poems ever get some speculate he may have died of urgent her throat bloom dread and I realized that I said version to or rabbis daughter\n[noise] I blush back\nAnd tried to extricate myself like getting high minded but\nOnly dug deeper\nInto an Oscar Wilde says [noise] shook her head no of course last [noise]\nNever mind I said sorry\nWhat did they say he said\nThat she says grave was the holiest site in Rome\nThat's beautiful\nShe said and smiled it was the first smile\nI'd love to read them some time\nYou can borrow this I offered her the book I mean I've read you\nKnow I Can't it's so big well there's just a few pages of keeps no I mean\nBecause my father just than the first worshipers appeared\nComing up the block and they're black or young kids scampering ahead one dropped ... and ran back on an impulse I open the book to the page I turned down and ripped it out\nHere\nA crush the palm and precedent to er palm for a second her eyes wide and like I started all animals\nMingling fear in high spirits does she hurried and pushing my paper rose under the sleeve of her blouse\nIs that there's a whole services time eyes fixed on the higher realms again I Can't really say what I saw through that screen but I Believe I found her in the diamond of allowed us I Believe that the prayer book she held before her face hid the OED on melancholy\nI Believe that when she looked up from the book and down into the congregation or either we're searching for mine and that she found them gazing up among about has\nAnd that she looked right at me\nAnd I believe she was crying\nThe next few days felt like I had a fever was hotter than ever and my mind felt stuck asked melted and struggling to move it would take me an hour to get through a page of on the genealogy of morals\nThen I fall asleep just for a moment for a single breath and how long dream\nOnce I was in Turin with nature when he was mad walking in the town square he put his arm around me come over stuff\nYes in Spanish I guess [noise]\nMy dream this was a Taliban [noise]\nI Am God he said happily I made this farce\nI hadn't seen ... after the service I guess the women left earlier while the men stayed all day and my vision of her reading the poem faded and became as unbelievable as my knee gee dream\nI spent a lot of time out on the step my mind see Suzie repeating her name what would I say the whole thing was better off forgotten\nStill when when they came and I went to the rabbis house to get my pay all my nerves were shaking and a drop of sweat fell from my forehead as I Know to tie my sneakers on his walk\nThe rabbi live just two streets west of me\nOn the block parallel to my own but I had never been down at the house was small with a slow shingle roof and a porch the garden was rich but overgrown a nest of wildflowers and binds and weeds\nJoining together without pattern\nThe rabbi answered the door himself\nHis arms were white as chicken and the short sleeved white dress shirt and I saw the nuts of his Teflon hanging out he sat me down\nIn his book choked back office and insisted vehemently that I drink hot tea with him that it would cool me down\nHe served it in a class with a lump of sugar on the side\nThe floor was crooked\nA sand pennies glittering between the war boards\nAnd the stuffing in my chair was shot I'd alerts forward to grab my tea and my little splash burn\nMy arm rest of my eyes on the books that was sacked everywhere the death floor couch all\nAll Hebrew and those rows of unknowable letters calmed me down\nIt was a relief to look at something beautiful without straining to comprehend it\nWas a photo of a woman tux behind the volumes on a shelf she was standing in the garden which looks even more overgrown than it was now\nTeams with crazy flowers blues and read by her feet and the yellow heads of sunflowers nodding from next taller than hers\nShe wore a headscarf and a printed apron over her dress\nThe sun glanced her face made it in distinct but the shape of beforehand and the ... of the eyes weren't Lee is is that your wife yes that's my Miriam\nA love hush alone\nI must have smiled blankly because he leaned forward and padded my hand\nIn Hebrew this means she should rest in peace\nOh I'm Sorry\nNo no\nShe's been dead now twenty four years\nLater he told me had been a late last child a surprise and they thought a blessing not marry him had died giving birth to Leah who came with her twisted lack now to lived alone in the house is three other daughters much older we're all long grown and married\nYou must miss her he shrugged", "show_name": "Selected Shorts", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "22"}
