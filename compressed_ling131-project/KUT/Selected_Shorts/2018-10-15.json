idea\nOh what's your head to understand about cordless he said was that he was a patriot\nNow that we're today I don't know means maybe nothing the cordless felt this very strong commitment to his country and to a certain kind of Matt making and he and the survey just ended up Monica ...\nThe weight cordless worked you see the way he approached things slowed down the production of maps well

wanted to see disillusionment in a man you should have seen cordless knows last month\nHe tried congressman he drives senators he tried other people and commerce she tried everybody but I think they
