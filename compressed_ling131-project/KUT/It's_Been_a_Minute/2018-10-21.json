T. done or tried to show some next which is spending less of a great show six o'clock for NPR I'm Sam Sanders is spending\nThis week from Panasonic may have solved the problem was open off the floor plans force as soon as I noted the words open office for playing around with have thoughts\nCollege\nAnyway Panasonic has come up with wearable technology blackout distractions of an open office the trash can everywhere [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] if Israel is basically a trash can over the head of household\nAround your head and it blocks out referral vision and apparently a block down to like\nCreating tunnel vision for you think of the things I put on horses are open offices have turned us and\nWe'll be focused on more headlines from the week that was after this new\nI'm just like you can't with the way the population is exploding in the middle east the facts that young people see a world outside of them because the Internet you know um and and and what better for themselves you can't not reform you cannot change\nAnd and I said I ... in this one interview I said I said well what about after Abdullah and he's like it's it's inevitable the next king will have to do better than this China\nI mean so Kelly watching this story unfold I'm American intelligence officials now seem to believe pretty forcefully that prince Mohammed bin ... crown prince of Saudi Arabia they believe that he was involved or at least really knew about this\nStudy had information yeah there's there's decent reporting by the New York times and the Washington Post that there is at least circumstantial evidence that he knew about it maybe perhaps even ordered the killing why would they want to kill him [noise]\nHe um spoke out against I'm against the current rulers in Saudi Arabia it's interesting though I mean he didn't you know we we sort of paint him as this\nAs this dissident but he was still a dissident was in the Saudi context yes we have left Saudi Arabia because he felt like he could speak more freely outside of the country which is something I Would guess was very difficult decision for him because they do that you're leaving your family behind and\nUm family is so important there\nUm but he he criticized the kingdom with in sort of the Saudi context\nLike I'm a Saudi first I'm a Muslim I still have very strong beliefs that this country can make it he still had that optimism um he was also very criticism ... he was very critical of President Trump yeah um and he was in the process\nOf um you know getting together a kind of think tank to talk about and\nUm you know fund Arab democracy initiatives dishes I'm an Arab thing right across the nation right\nAnd this is just to kind of stuff that the rulers and Saudi Arabia did not want to talk about they don't want to talk about freedom and democracy right now what\nShould we make of the response to this you know lane by our president and his White House at first she was refusing to even\nSuggested he might believe that the Saudis were involved it is a reality in American foreign policy before Donald Trump was hurt that we give recover and give him a pet I mean and so I mean I could see Obama or George W. Bush doing the same thing but a nicer words\nRight and doing this sort of due diligence of sitting down with the king you know once a year or saying we care about human rights uh-huh shouldn't have jail this blogger that's bad and it's almost like you sort of go through the motions and everybody knows that it's like that things but still it's that thing you do right\nNow the the motions yeah\nYou're going out that there's a strategic reasons for why we're still literally holding hands with the Saudis yeah you know that they are a military ally\nI'll tell you one reason why I said this is scary yeah you know I'm I have lived in countries where journalists are called enemies of the people and we see what happens when journalists are called enemies of the people just Thursday night at a rally\nYou know President Trump is defending a congressman from Montana\nWho attacked a journal yeah um I don't want to live in this world I don't want this world to come home in the country and that I thought I was safe and\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here we are too great yesterday Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team and Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded care and do you have three words\nUh yeah I'm kind of tired of the whole business but my three words would be it's my history was and that came from Senator Elizabeth Warren\nA\nStory okay it it started Monday and I'm already it feels like I've been living in this saga for a year for\nTwo years because candidate Donald Trump after she mentioned I think in twenty sixteen that she had Native American ancestry that she came from Oklahoma I Believe matured and editor and you know Cherokee territory the president's started calling her Pocahontas\nWhich led her to this week on Monday releasing a five minute video that Warren says revealed the results of a DNA test that you took which found quote strong evidence that she has a Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations\nI'm not I'm relatively thrive in only trying to determine tribal citizenship I understand and ...\nMy family history is my family history\nSo basically she's saying yeah you know I have always been told the story in my family was told by my mom and dad by my mama and papa they've always said you know this is what it is and I can take it if you're bashing me don't be talking about my family yeah\nBut the strangest thing to me in this entire saga Karen is that it seems as if Senator Warren never\nActually consulted the Cherokee Nation before she did this yeah it has had so they had the ... yeah I mean as she put this video out they said actually\nWhen people use DNA to assert tribal identity your ancestry is insulting to us because that's not the method that we use ... yeah that's not her then just ... right yeah\nAnd you haven't lived this way or had the experience that we've had so it's kind of hard for you to come out and say that I interviewed a a\nSociologist who also does a lot of work with DNA at Columbia her name was Alondra Nelson and she said the problem with doing these DNA tests and then claiming oh I'm really German instead of Italian or I'm really whatever\nIs that DNA is technical and identity is social exactly we can't really mix the two that running a parallel track\nAnd she got to live an entire life as a white woman mhm and get whatever you'd get out of that also it's like the one time we have a national conversation about native people there is centered on white people\nBills we're I mean in some ways it's like going forward how should we talk well and I also had a question because there was this weird thing in American culture of like I got you know my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess or something like that really awkward I mean people I think say it less and less but like\nYou know is it time to just sort of reckon with all of that and like actually learn the history yeah which tribes inter married in which tribes didn't and what does that mean and what does it mean that the tribes and even if that wasn't at us and that is to say that\nIn America probably only about five percent of us have really any native blood at ...\nUh I have three words okay they are no not yet\nOkay what does that mean I was talking about how it feels as if we are already in campaign twenty twenty ... oh yeah oh now I Know\n[laughter] and I'm\nBringing this up because of two Democrats that have been getting national attention for months now uh you mentioned Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts She is one of the other one is Beto O'Rourke he's running for Senate in ... and had Cruz actually interviewed him on this show months' ago huh\nBut um this coverage of but to overwork and his race against Ted Cruz has been fully nationalized they had a debate this week and it got national coverage and I saw a journalist from New York and DC live tweeting this thing there are ... more than one potash yeah about ... to work yeah he's\nRunning for the Senate not for president and it seems as if he has become this great hope for liberals especially in this season of Trump\nBut even on his best days the polls have him down by like at least five points\nYou're right the coverage has has shifted um and then the conversation was about how much money he's raised and then there was a big question about\nIs he going to share that money with other ... Democrat yeah other national races where Democrats are neck and neck for Senate races\nIn ... in tight states is he going to help them win yeah and the answer was basically no money right and it was like and then the sense the narrative kind of became but that's okay if we can recognize what he's going to run and twenty like literally I was going around and twenty yeah right\nThere are already polls of democratic candidates coming out for twenty twenty it's insane and the other candidate that is making me think of twenty twenty already is Elizabeth Warren ... because you know she had this video out about her ancestry she talks about Donald Trump Donald Trump is in the video [noise]\nEveryone forgets she's running for reelection in the Senate this year against someone named Jeff deal I've been talking about like food we hoo ha I go to I've been talking to folks yes week who don't actually know that she's running for Senate this year because they all think she's running against all joke\nIf either either right when I Want to yeah yeah no I I don't want to live in this world just yet yeah I don't I'm not ready for it yet let it be don't talk to me about Iowa layout offered me a poll start raising\nNo care as long as there at the state fair on a stick on many Harnett ... well because you don't want to [laughter]\nSystem will go on hold they were before I let us know that's what I'm asking area though that you know Yoda brave [laughter]\nWhen we come back we will talk about some serious case of fake poke study appearing in real academic journals and also later my chat with Rudy Val decimated HBO documentary about his sister while she was in prison you're listening to it's been a minute from NPR we'll be right back\nAnother one of the journals was that ... excepted one of our papers and was working with us on a second one is hype Asia and if you want to disregard hype ... then you have to disregard all a feminist philosophy more or less because it's one of the leading journals in that field in the home of\nMany of the leading a systems of thought within feminist philosophy so high paid should\nI pay if you want to put it down to you know bad journals or whatever bad message that the journals high pay she has a hard one to pin that on because you're throwing allowed under the bus with it you know my opinion is is if you want to throw feminist philosophy under the bus because of our paper more power to you but you're actually probably making a mistake\nBut you know that people are going to see these host studies in these headlines and a lot of folks are going to say this is the reason why we need to shut down gender studies programs and ... and re studies programs and and and like you know that's going to happen\nYeah but if we if we made the decision to act entirely based on the way that bad actors might make use of our work we could never really do anything that touches a controversial issue at all so if the right wing wants to misuse our work to do this\nThen it's on par with what we're exposing in these academic departments what we're after here is the truth what we're after here is better conversations\nYeah one of the thought experiments your hopes studies ah launched me on was trying to create hypothetical hoax studies about public radio [laughter]\n... given me a hypothetical hoax studied title about my line of work\nAbout your line of work about public radio yeah you'd have to put a catchy thing on the front I'm into\nLike a year chose called it's been a minute so we could call it it's been a minute too long and that would be the main\nTitle uh-huh subtitled have to be something along the lines of how how well intended conversations on public radio perpetuate America's racial divide\nThat study I'm curious I'm curious I can\nMake it up for you [laughter] well ... oh okay\nOkay James Lindsey a thank you for speaking with me I Am sure we'll hear a lot from our listeners that I look forward to it thanks\nSam I think this is great [laughter]\n\nThanks again to James we're talking with death um [noise] I think my biggest question with all of this big [noise] All right if you're trying to push these fields to greater truth how do you get there through these live for these hopes the study is it how I Know\nI Am so tired of hoaxes like in this post truth era and like\nMore troops not laugh yeah I get I get really upset about Sasha Baron Cohen now I really do like I've posing as a journalist yeah and you know the more of that we have um it just undermines the business of truth altogether I think yeah\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests today Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded in Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team uh I Am so happy to have you both in Studio\nHere so if you to be happy to be here it is time for my favorite game hopefully I'll say ... to ...
