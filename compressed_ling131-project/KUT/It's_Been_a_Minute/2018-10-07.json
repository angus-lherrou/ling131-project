U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one Austin on line of duty or trade they showed just got here he is coming up next with lots of great show including it's been a minute with them than there's the next six o'clock on K U T Ninety point\nFor maybe our I'm Sam Sanders it's been a minute\nPolitics right now is inescapable at follows us everywhere\nThis week there's new evidence to support that idea photos are released a reactor Christian Bale portraying Dick Cheney and an upcoming movie about Dick Cheney\nAlso in the Broadway play was announced it's all about Hillary Clinton\nI was so conflicted one I saw the news yesterday about the Clinton play we can't get away from the stuff\nI Want like my pop culture totally free from politics but at my panel pointed out you don't always get what you want\nI have heard that a Scaramucci has put on a Broadway play\nBy off Broadway well OK musical [laughter]\nWe'll give you more headlines from the ... was an ... of that scare moved to a musical after this news\n[laughter] yeah they made the position I I really think that last Thursday was a really bad day for the court\nThat that was not a person who I can see on the Supreme Court like ... ... it was\nRaised in out in out intentionally acrimonious partisanship\nIf you remember when when Justice Ginsburg like made those comments about Trump during the campaign she actually did pull back and that's the only ... and I imagine that that was the result of a a conversation with the chief justice\nSo what's your take on all this as someone watching it but not directly covering up\nMm it's hard to say the memory of the news cycle\nIs extremely short these days um so I I hadn't I hate to say that if I'm Brett Kavanaugh becomes the new Supreme Court justice that you know Twenty years later this moment in history won't be perceived um much differently than you know the Anita Hill hearings\nYou know fast is the thing that we kinda just shrug off now right so I hesitate to say that it will have some kind of transformative moment but I also don't discount the possibility that it will be transformative moment um I think we have to see how exactly the nomination play that\nOne big difference that I think is part of the change times is I mean remember when Justice Thomas took the bench there was only one other woman on the court was a a woman appointed by a Republican president Justice Sandra Day O'Connor um\nI mean after last week right if Brett Kavanaugh joins the court he's going to be joining the court with with three justices who I mean I'm sure Justice Sotomayor has\nJust said to have had some thoughts yeah we should say here were taping this Friday morning so you might hear this after we know for sure whether Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed for a seat on the Supreme Court All right I'm going to go next to my three words or California versus Trump\nAnd I say that because\nUh the issue that I ... out the most snow there's about his ended up talking about that ... that you know I Love the [laughter]\nThe silence he hears me leaving the room talking about it as a tech reporter but I'm going to make you talk about it a little bit bringing it up and talking about California [laughter] because\nUh the Trump Justice Department this week sued the state of California to block California's new net neutrality law the back story is a few months ago at the top administration rolled back existing net neutrality rules\nAnd California in response said we'll make our own I think a before we go anywhere else with this I'm going to let the tech reporter tell us in a nutshell what net neutrality is so\nUh I think that line that I sent you guys to some of the uh said to me on Twitter I I think this week last week I don't know it's always together these days\nUm is that near net neutrality for the tech reporters and the tech lobbyists world is like the Internet version of hotel California has the issue has been going on\nFor ten plus years yeah but anyways the long story short as net neutrality rules went off the books are in the summer\nAnd your child your rules previously a established Internet service providers were not allowed to make your website blood flow where they were not allowed to charge a little extra\nFor slightly faster speeds loading speeds they weren't allowed to strike deals with like Netflix to get your Netflix slightly faster than your Hulu similarly I'm In California is case what California brought back our all of those rules plus an additional ... and other ruled that prohibited I'm like of arising from giving you\nAccess to Hulu that wouldn't count toward your data restrictions\nSo basically I'm California was saying the ISPs the service providers can't play favorites which is the basic kind of like in a nutshell what nationality means\nRight I I like to I like to describe it as how much power should your Internet service provider have over your experience\nSo then so California puts these rules in place on the state level\nThe Trump the OJ sous but the bigger point for me is that this is yet another example of California showing\nA type of resistance to Trump that may not be the first thing that we think about when we say the word resistance like we say that word we think of people on the ground protesting but there was a resistance to the Trump White house coming from state houses\nChris what does this kind of legal resistance how effective is I\nMean a lot of it is from the ages it's from California a jeep Sarah it's from uh New York AG Barbara Underwood\nIt also there have been some some counties Santa Clara county in California San Francisco county\nYou basically have always have this I mean if you remember all of Texas law suits against stop on DACA under the Obama administration has this has been\nBuilt the way for the age of the other party of the president to sort of try and say we're back to our dual sovereignty they it it states trying to say we want to do our thing and we shouldn't be allowed to do so um\nIs that more effective than protesters just on the ground saying stop Donald Trump\nI mean I think they're two totally different things I think that the\nReality of what Trump has done has led to a lot of lawsuits that probably regardless of the the environment on the ground democratic ... would have fought back against but the the fact is that in a liberal state you cannot go wrong\nRight now I'm by Donald Trump putting their name yes by getting a lawsuit that is your name the Trump\nSome more to come for sure you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here we are too great guests today Alina Selyukh business correspondent for NPR and Chris died in a legal editor for buzzfeed news Alina did you get three words\nDo my three words are up to Fifteen and then there was that out okay that's about Amazon money yeah dollars\nI'm so Amazon made huge waves this week uh announcing that the company will raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid workers uh up to Fifteen dollars so this is mainly a four warehouse workers and\nThis is big because I don't know if you knew this but Amazon is now the second largest private employer in the United states really who's the first Wal Mart's so oh in the number one Amazon's number two and huh\nThis change will affect by Amazon estimates a three hundred and fifty thousand workers this year and a lot about a third of them are are ... are expected seasonal hires\n'em and did you know what the federal minimum wage is it seven dollars and twenty five so I'm like oh okay um so this is much higher than that\nIt's like double it's remarkable to me I mean thinking yeah how how long it's been since I had my first job and\nIt hasn't changed that my hand and actually I remember it was five something when I was just starting out and then if yeah bumped to seven while I was still like an adolescent but it's been there for a long yeah so my question though Alina\nAs like [noise] is it fair or unfair that I saw this new ma'am is on and said\nOh well it's also a PR ploy you know they've had some critique of their business practices how they treat employees they've had some critique over the fact that Jeff Bezos is so rich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is just the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR that convenience or element to this to give you an example Senator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers and hats\nAnd fighting Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now introduced a\nBill that's called stop basis act a you know that no love to fish [laughter]\nYeah hands on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's yes we are is definitely part of it and\nAnother really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure it can't hurt\nUp some attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all day as you know when you look\nAt a\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here with two gas I mean a sell your business correspondent for NPR and Chris guiding her legal editor at buzzfeed news uh it is time for my favorite game who said that\nAlso Alina you're an old pro at this game basically I Will share three quotes from the week you can guess who said it or what story I'm Talking about or a key word I'm not a stickler and the winner of this game gets absolutely nothing oh good [laughter]\nIt's going to be great it's going to be great ready for the first one okay no [laughter] well here we go here we go we'll try it first quote I cannot deny that women made a great achievement over the past century there is significant progress recorded by people who study women status throughout history\nIs it something Nobel Prize early\nAh no not at all [laughter] did either of you see any headlines about a really weird article an in flight magazine oh oh my God yes that was the\nDrew Barrymore article\nYes you've got your dad\nSo in Egypt airs in flight magazine this month there was an interview\nWith Drew Barrymore but it turns out the entire interview seems to be fate\nI'm Sorry what like she never spoke to them and they just made it\nSo when Reid for comment Drew Barrymore PR team said that she never did the interview a Egypt Air is not backing down from this interview they say it was conducted by the president of the Hollywood press association but the thing is when you read the interview the English is very bad\nAnd it just does not at all seem like a kind of conversation that Drew Barrymore would give I have\nTo I have to question why she didn't want as did they just interview someone else that they confused with you\nAnd if if they actually made up the whole thing then why did they make up an interview with Drew Barrymore there were pictures and everything\nYeah there were pictures of earth so like they talk about Drew Barrymore before they get into the quotes from her the fake quotes from her and the articles opens up this way ... literally quote\nDespite the several unsuccessful marriages and despite the busy life of stardom but not in her life for several years the beautiful American Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore has recently decided to temporary taken unlimited vacation to play her most crucial role as mother while\nThey did they just look up some other Drew Barrymore and that was it was\nOh this was legit [laughter] although there's a version of his article\nBut also appeared and another Arabic publication which raises the possibility\nThat those quotes had been translated from English to Arabic than back and that just makes it even ... this is a crazy story I've seen in the last few months like make your own adventure may yeah\nSo Chris you're up one zip who would've thought for everything so proud of you second quote is uh just tell me what it's about what the what the story key words are the quote is sometimes your child's gender identity is actually fire and like star in the lion king hunted you'd better be prepared\nI'm Sorry what what story this week involves fire and babies and child's gender identity\nOh it's the guy who said the cuts were doing was doing a gender viewing party and set the whole force our\nJob you know that's all I have about that story is exactly what it is he was a border patrol agent is that what\nHe's a border patrol and he was off duty his name is Dennis Dickey he's from Arizona and he says it was all a mistake what he wanted to do was shoot at this target that contained Tanner right which is explosive\nSo that when he shot the tenor right it would explode and you would see this explosion of blue or this explosion of pink and that would reveal the child's gender the explosion was too explosive they started a fire\nThey've got so big fire got so big it got to name the sawmill fire nearly eight hundred firefighters had to fight this fire consumed more than forty five thousand acres of\nLand I mean I cannot I definitely didn't see that sorry um I Know that I just asked I had no idea that\nThere was a whole quote on the story about the gender yang fire well so that actually was from a humor writer are airing Thomas he wrote kind of a parity article about this story that Elle magazine and she kind of made us all chuckle about how absurd eastern to reveal parties can be\nYeah I mean it started with cakes and then in progress into like balloon really says out of boxes flags flying in this guy and there was one\nWhere this father had an alligator for the gender revealed party and he had a watermelon that he put in the alligators mouth\nAnd the watermelon was filled with either blue dye or pink die so when the alligator bit down on the watermelon the pink or blue color would lose out of the watermelon to reveal the gender\nIs not a word I hear about censoring neo part\nI don't get it at all and like I Want to understand and I just try to understand I don't understand\nThe party you know it's every reason to celebrate get it I read an alligator at a party but the same nest of it is I mean a lot of people go overboard planning parties so\nFair that [laughter] we're tied up and gather tied one to one okay [laughter]\nThis is ... and these are all the marbles ready okay the last quote is\nEvery night the cue for donuts is unbelievable lights noises pollution and horns all Street's blocked in all cars honking at once all night\nEvery night what's that about who said that whereas it\nWas about he said ... what kind of don't ask don't is what kind of donuts what's which which branch Doug\nDunkin' Donuts not Duncan\nCrispy cream yes [laughter] yes there are there any other don't either I mean there is I entered but those are like the only do like hey wait though will be\nCranes you'll get Krispy Kreme donuts made\nNews across the pond I'm a town in Ireland called Blanchard town\nA a suburb of Dublin they got a new crispy cream with a twenty four hour drive through and the twenty four hour drive through at Krispy Kreme was so rowdy they had to shut it down\nSo that quote was from a resident from this place Blanchard town talking about how the noise from the drive through line for these Krispy Kreme donuts has been too much on there\nWere ... of them says Jonah\nKnow here's the thing people would be in line for the donuts but they would keep honking their horns\n[laughter] ever on me I get your call there\nAnother residents said since the grand opening they haven't had proper sleep at night are we talking about like at like\nAt our clothes like Taco Bell but like they were gone for crispy cream at like three in the\nMorning thanks so I mean if I could go get Krispy Kreme donuts twenty four hours a day I'd probably be there was some weird hours too but I've never in my life ...\n... ... met a woman who sat in front of a crispy cream for I think close to three days to be the first one in so she could get lifetime supply of Krispy Kreme donuts for herself and her family they are good donuts they argued done that for a lifetime supply\nI can get bad yeah by like random friday night meeting the Hong my harm or I get it [laughter]\nUm you know what this means show us why why\nMight grand prize of nothing not even a crispy cream that might be arranged [noise]\nWith
