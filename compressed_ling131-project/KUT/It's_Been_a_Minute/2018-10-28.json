to actually implement that thing\nRight there is a lot of talk and it's like to get from a place where this is actually going to be an active is as far as still far away\nSo far what do we know anymore at the end of a week of these headlines if the White House has actually close to doing this they really haven't set of words they having what was that any time you know the memo came out and we don't even who leaked it in the ministry exactly\nIt was I I feel like you never know how these stories happen and what what is behind it but the one thing that I say is a bright spot is a lot of um activism and support and and people standing together um to to say transpose exist yeah they are here they're they're not going away you can't find them out of existence\nWell and it's like a lot of people on the left and right this week we're talking about what it means to be trans fat and that might be a silver lining\n... you're listening to it's been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was I'm Sam Sanders here we're too great gifts to Julia ... cats are extraordinary and Stacey Vanek Smith host of NPR's the indicator podcast\nI must confess that I have three words\nI was just calling me [laughter] this is not running for the whole episode just called me\nAnd my three words are in the end of the question mark\nAre we lying oh and I asked is this week of the media\nBecause I've seen particularly this week this phenomenon where Trump says the thing that we all know was not true but the media and its effort to debunk them is truth repeats the mystery shopping about the for me the biggest thing right now is\nTrump's claim this week that there is a caravan of migrants coming up to our southern border\nUh contains unknown middle Easterners yeah at least ...\nHe ... he made a gesture at that there were Muslim ISIS members or yeah like that do in the Caribbean yeah yeah\nThere was no evidence this was the case and later on even Trump himself had to admit there was no evidence that that was the case\nBut all that I heard all week was every newsroom across the country including ours\nUse the words middle Easterners and terrorists right next to the word caravan and so we're planting the message that he wants to be planted even as we say that we are doing our work by saying that's not true its wings us all to his and it's this message images implants in your head\n... now you're thinking about these words together you know if this happened began this week when a Trump tweeted that Democrats want to get rid of help protections for people with preexisting conditions and that his party the G O P\nUh is on the opposite side of the issue that law only ... you know I mean I guess we have seen the administration back a GOP led lawsuit that claim that Obamacare's preexisting conditions protections are illegal right\nLike it's literally the opposite of what is true but then Trump says the ms truth in we repeat it\nLike are we carrying his water are we lying for him\nI think is incredibly effective I think President Trump is incredibly effective at controlling the news cycle and what's interesting to think about for me it's like what should a news organization ideally do so yeah if the president says something that is definitely not true yeah\nThen do you not report and\nHow do we avoid exhilarating these things you know I used the word terrorists and describing his comments on middle Easterners he didn't use that word he just said unknown\nMiddle Easterners but you get those words in your head and all of a sudden you're thinking of other words like terrorists right because he's dog whistling to his base he's talked I think that it's that I wasn't the only way I don't know that term I mean although I guess like if we were in charge of these newsrooms what would we want our newsroom to ignore I Can't say\nIt's a good question and everyone else's reporting it it's like well you know why isn't the same standards network covering hair man\nAs I Am then [laughter]\nIt let's get a million [laughter]\nBegun color [laughter] a space\nIf you have to work I Do um\nShifting Saudi stories say that in them that this is so I've been covering um you know I cover business and economics covering Saudi Arabia for a long time because of oil and just watching how\nThe way that the country and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has handled the news about the murder of the journalists ...\nAnd just how the story that change and also how the attitude of the Saudi Government his change\nYeah well the latest is uh the government and the crown prince have said now that they believe the killing was premeditated yes which is the furthest they've gone to actually match the story that the authorities have\nAnd apparently they also let ... son out of the ...\nFree he'd a travel ban had been imposed on him he's a U.S citizen he hadn't been allowed to leave Saudi because of his father speaking out against the kingdom a law so he was allowed to go to the U.S very awkward ... but that was that was quite a concession and a lot of ways from from Saudi Arabia\nHad a show that Saudi Arabia is feeling pressure and possible financial pressure there's talk that countries might invest lesser stopping investing in this country or by less from them it's just really any economic pressure on Saudi Arabia or is it just a blip\nEnormous I think it's enormous really um why as well so Saudi Arabia basically this whole economy's just one company Saudi Aramco which is the oil company it's basically bank roles like thousands of Saudi princes it is the biggest company in the world it is\nReally know what it was an apple\nOh yeah they know when they when they began a\nIt's a Saudi Aramco Saturday radical you know\nIt's the biggest and so they were going to go go go public can sell shares and the NBA big plan so they were like Saudi Aramco is going to go public and sell shares and no one knew how big this company was there like maybe it's worth a trillion I mean just like huge numbers being thrown out\nBut the problem is like if you go public and sell shares all stock exchanges over the world were competing in your pocket change is competing China with competing everybody wanted a piece of this this was going to be the biggest they lose control right\nBut you have to disclose you you have to open up your book a Saudi Arabia was trying to figure out like well maybe like we'll just take five percent of it public or ten percent of it public and the New York stock exchange like we can't do that and want to look right and and you know this is like the bank rolls of all the Saudi royal family\nAnd suddenly you just haven't been hearing about it unless you this was huge news this is going to be the ideal to end all IPO's covers strong economy it's everything now crickets and a lot of companies I think because of this incident or like what is happening here\nWell and we know that like a bunch of us tech companies are benefiting roast Saudi money taken it are they going to send it back\nRight right [laughter] All right um and that we're going to take a break coming up I Will tell you

God wow that quote actually was from Kim ... she was talking to our shores well for this story\nAnd um she left her dead\nMothers ashes in the water in a small world ride\nApparently people smuggle in the ashes and Ziploc bags or pill bottles they leave them in flower beds I leave them in places like the ... under the Dumbo ride\nSo this is like a thing of the big thing and it's gotten so bad that Disney employees actually have a term for when they have to take care of the ashes they call it I have to\nClean up like the ... filter in your vacuum\nA and apparently the most popular spot for the ashes is the hunted mansion\nHow he can well maybe it's like a it's like a ghost connections say but why the hunted mentioned was there any explanation\nThat's surprising to me 'cause that's like the least sentimental like small world I can get like maybe the nice memory with your kid or your family but the hunted mansion and\nLeave on like a waffle house [laughter] oh I Do my best life I mean
