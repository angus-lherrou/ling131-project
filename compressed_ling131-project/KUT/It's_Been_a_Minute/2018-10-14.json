[noise]\nThis week we're taking a break from the news of the week with a special episode all this hour we're talking about coming out this past Thursday October eleventh it was a thirtieth annual national coming out today so we're exploring in death how coming out his change where it came from in the first [noise]\nYour immediate family [noise] I tell you\nGoing to be they are your your your your people your\nOut story listeners gas mom as there have been a time when you felt attracted to another woman and she [laughter]\nAround and thought about and she said no and I said well neither have\nAnd later the best things that happened to our listeners all week first business\nSource of power infants and and also it just it comes up in conversation and move on\nThe young Bob Mondello ... would that young Bob ever imagined Bob today coming out to rooms of strangers by President Bush and his husband no yeah no that that ah that was beyond the pale\n[noise] [noise] ooh thanks again to Bob Mondello will here a few more coming out story throughout the show today including some from you our listeners\nFor our line the brief conversation\nShe said you mean to tell me you like other men and I said yes ma'am and she said why\nDidn't I didn't grow out of it [noise] ah I'm Hal again the ground for more than [noise]\n\nWant to take some time now to talk to the history of coming out day as we know it now to do that and I sat down with professor Marci\nGallo hello hello how are you got to go I'm great is is Sam Sam Oh I'm so excited and you can call me Marcy I Would call you Marci ... wonderful\nMarcy is an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada Las Vegas she specializes in race gender sexuality and social justice movements she told me to understand how coming out got its own day you have to understand the history of the gay rights movement you\nMight think of that began in the sixties but Marcy told me the roots of his activism we can actually see the decades earlier\nYou know I Would go back to the post World War two period okay and the world war two some people said because it broke down social norms I'm In such a huge wake because remember it was a war against\nHate it was a war against discrimination I we were fighting the Nazis and then you see these black men come back and they fought for freedom elsewhere and they can be treated\nAs free people at home and ... exactly so the impetus for the civil rights movement there's a direct connection between the black civil rights movement and a lesbian and gay movement\nMany of the early activists were either in civil rights movement who if they were white or black or they were working against the war in Vietnam that the other thing that's happening\nAnd I think they started to realize\nI'm hey you know we're a minority to mhm I'm lesbian and gay people are treated horribly and maybe it's time for us to organize and start\nPlaying for like you know in speaking of coming out it is\nVery easy I think to assume that this is a thing that people always did but cultural notions of sexuality and defining sexuality have changed and there was a time when the whole the very concept of defining it are are declaring one's sexuality wasn't the thing right\nNow right exactly you know for for gay folks I think the whole idea of coming out is is very much a sort of a more contemporary kind of concept when I'm I was doing research on the first lesbian rights organization ...\nStarted in fifty five Nineteen fifty five in San Francisco\nBay and use that term and all they didn't even require that people um announce their their sexuality any woman could join your organization but when they did refer to they talked about taking off the mask\nWhich I really I think that's such a great visual wait for the coming out staff I think might have been\nSort of a thing with gay men I'm In and certainly you know the the obvious connotation might is around um society like debutante coming out parties would they would be presented to society well that wasn't my world [laughter]\nAnd it was in the world of a lot of people in a story before I was that I actually was an escort for a friend to her debutante bomb\nYou learn how to love it I rented tax than it was just saying I'm trying to make something happened that was going to happen\nThat grade a great story right so that when people say coming and I'm like what do you mean like get that much but it really gets popularized as as a show you know is in actually in the seventies yeah Harvey Milk says you've got to come out\n\nAnd gave her\nCome out [noise]\nOr we should first stop the idea\nOf what made a member of the board of supervisors half of the [noise]\nThe tape is him from Nineteen Seventy eight she was marking the defeat of props six in California that were banned gays and lesbians from teaching at schools there\nTell your immediate family\nYou must tell\nGoing to be they are your your your people you're\nSo interesting because I didn't think I think when I hear that the top of that [laughter] that was\nThat we are in the children that we are indeed everywhere\nEvery lie every anywhere to do what we destroy\nHis right I think he was right about the more we were up front about who we were the more it would\nShake up the misconceptions and to start on the personal level with family and friends and coworkers that had to start to break down some of the stereotypes about you know six sinful crazy kind of stuff that was there much attached to gay people still\nAnd so you know ten years after that speech we see the cat in the first coming out day this is October eleventh Nineteen eighty eight or what has changed in those ten years and what has made coming out they become formalized by that\nYeah wow that's a ... a lot [laughter] um one thing of course is that he murdered shortly after giving that speech and um that\nProbably encouraged even more people to stand up and say yeah I'm gay and lesbian um the other thing is that in the national news and started [noise]\n\nAnd by Nineteen eighty seven when the second national march on Washington there's an actual game of rights for gay and lesbian my actual combat action\nThat people engaging thousands of gay and lesbian activists marched past the White House today demanding protection from discrimination and calling for more federal money for AIDS research and treatment [laughter]\nThey most miles I mean it was a huge march the official figure recorded by CBS News the day after the event six hundred and fifty thousand people a figure greater than Martin Luther king's famous march for civil rights back in Nineteen sixty so largest gay rights much\nHow was it was great it was so much fun and that's when my brother and sister in law came down and he joined in it now was it was terrific [noise]\nIn Nineteen eighty eight coming out got its own day\nOctober eleventh [noise] in March the one year anniversary of that big march march she says that was born out of intense activism by the algae to community over the AIDS crisis and the government indifference to that crisis so in different that President\nRonald Reagan didn't even say the word aids in public until September Nineteen eighty five that was a few years after the federal government first acknowledge the disease\nIt was a hard time to be gay and hard times come out but not quite ten years later America would witness maybe the biggest coming out story it had seen yet\n[noise]\nAre you [noise]\nYelling when you're trying to come\n\nComing out in Nineteen Ninety seven when James and then plus more with professor Marci Gallo after break I'm Sam Sanders you're listening to it's been a minute some NPR [noise]\nAnd I'm Tracy

[laughter]\n\nWatch video that she said well if that's the way you are you know I I guess I just have to accept that you're my son and I love you but that actually wasn't the truth I mean it it was true that you love me but it it she wasn't quite\nA being truth about accepting it because it would probably be another decade before she really\nAccepted me\nAnd then all came to a head at my commitment ceremony with my partner now husband ... and um she wasn't going to come at initially but she decided to come and not only did she come she walked in\nWith me and that was a real turning point for her because most of the people and attendance at our commitment ceremony where straight and in some ways I think that gave her permission for it to be okay and say that [noise]\nWell when I after I came out here for instance she didn't talk to anybody about it not not even her closest friends because I think there was a lot of\nShame a around it\nUm because of\nUh her reputation ... also who I was I mean I'm the first\nAfrican American born in my little hometown\nUm to receive a PHD and ... my home town celebrated that accomplishment with giving me my own day wow what's your hometown Hickory North Carolina okay\nAnd so you know so there was a lot of hope and dreams invested in e Patrick Johnson a but not gay fast right John when is it all good now with knowledge of it is yeah it's a it's a love fest\nWow I Will never forget my mother um soap in a ... I mean literally like was born wearing a chapel kept like just paddock awesome [laughter] ... we ... this was before I was coming out [noise]\nAnd I don't know how it happened but I put on Brokeback Mountain when it was like happening while and I was like I'm going to hear from her\nAnd I'll never forget she watched the whole movie\nHouse I might catch them in the home of the [noise] the movie and I look over she is co Ryan ... and I look at her and I was like what's the matter in this Pentecostal church organist like\nSo saved looks at me and says and through tears like choking back tears [noise] well I just don't get why those who can't be together ... is a strange it was so strange anyway ... ... people contain multitudes even church absolutely\nHearing Patrick tell his story thinking about my own story\nIt made me wonder why the idea of some grant coming out as always felt to me at least like a thing that's just for white people especially given what we heard from Dr Marcy Gallo earlier how the gay rights movement really grew out of the civil rights struggle of people of color\nAnd this post World war two activism also led by people of color given those roots why it's coming out belt so white\nTo speak to that question you have to go back to slavery when you think about black women being raped and made to bear their masters children\nOr having their own children taken away from them or a black man being\nLynched or a lamb being cut off or just a suspicion of looking at a white woman\nYou have the ingredients for some pretty messed up psychological and emotional trauma around once body weight your sexuality in particular is always under surveillance or doesn't even belong to you\nYeah well and and and like that could lead to obviously black people feeling as if their sexuality and owning their sexuality isn't really there on\nExactly so if you think about coming out of slavery into post reconstruction there was a a movement among the black middle class in particular to counter the images of black people as savages as\nThere was an an adoption of Victorian mores and values\nBut what that meant was adopting what is now known in in mostly academic circles as the politics of black respectability [noise] where are women for instance with you know wear\nGloves and long dresses and um there was a hell of a sense of propriety a gambling and drinking and those kinds of things were about\nA lot of funding is still like staff it always gives me pause is like black people consume cleaning products writ large more than other demo yeah because you want to make sure that you look and smell and feel clean to the wife of all of that\nYou know as if you think about the historical context is about you know making sure you present yourself in a respectable way\nThat was eat Patrick Johnson the chair of the African American studies department at Northwestern university [noise] more of a conversation after a brand new black men and being on quote the down [noise] one coming out story from a transgender when [noise] I'm Sam Sanders you're listening to it's benefited from in PR\nWe'll be right back on track to show this is Katie Ninety point fine thank you for listening the K.
