you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine you know a Jamie stars just another way saying I'm ripping off the ground here\nNow I'm not going to recommend this to everybody a but man if your prince man\nThis is that this was meant it from Avon is a man like yeah but if somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt I just found those Mary don't you we're um and and give us a whole album that you know instead this is going to be no he's going to be putting out records you no longer than he was\nNo doubt about it there's gonna be hundreds of prince records before we're we're all guns\nIt all hang\nOut 'cause\nGreg that is a little bit of a song whole world around the\nTitle track of the ten thousand by Sam Philips her first record in five years the same Philips has had a fascinating life and career began writing songs as a teenager and came to the world as a Christian artist in the mid eighties\nThe late eighties and the early nineties she left that\nWorld behind but not her religion she's always been fascinated in philosophy and in fundamentalism she hooked up with and married\nT bone Burnett the great producer and we got a string of uh really\nBe Lovett albums the indescribable wow cruel inventions martinis in bikinis wonderful power pop records that's the second phase of her career I Would say she had a third phase nearly two thousands recording for none such records\nDabbling with a lot of different styles and now after five years silence she is back with world on sticks\nUm she has long been a songwriters songwriter dare I say almost Leonard Cohen like in her acid which are an emerging that though with with these beautiful melodies at the best throughout her can and\nAll of that means nothing to many of our younger listeners who will now jump up and down when I say she also did the ... song in the Gilmore Girls\nI think there's a whole generation of people who only know that and probably didn't even know her name so Leslie Phillips or\nRe christened yourself Sam because there was a childhood nickname what is she giving us on her latest album here is a track\nCalled how much is enough by Sam\nUps on sand opinions on keeps giving now two men were not\nThey went down and eat\nChain get\nWe're just trying to share [laughter]\nHave neither\nThat is how much is enough from Sam Philips his new record world on sticks San Philips\nDoesn't really a lot of music or in the last few decades Jim she's been very I'm\nSmart ... with the ... cording she's put out but I Would say each one of those is very carefully considered and is a small gym in its own right and I put this record in that category\nYou know that question how much is enough there's a lot of questions on this record where we live when they conquered the years when they break down the doors to easy street will they leave anything for you\nYou know this is her apocalyptic yeah that is about you know we're on the precipice\nOf an ecological disaster\nUh she's going to uh you know remind us of the fact that we're in a fragile place right now is the world are ruled on sticks so brave so small it's a key learning direct direct and at the same time you're going to manage it sounds really oppressive I mean it sounds like I'm being lectured do or what is this going to be\nBut the music she she approaches and music with a light touch 'em you know she's ... she's got a great group of musicians that love to work with her uh especially a drummer Jay Bell arose he's a credible drummer I think the Castro field he brings to his drumming to accompany the songs\nShe also plays with a small string section the section quartet in fact they're called a that bring a real bike to their parts it's not just bushy and soft\nAnd and that's a very a very nice a counterpoint to the way filter write songs you know you always get a hooker a phrase or a little surprising there that sort of sticks with you ... long after the songs done these are very very sharply etched songs there's not a wasted note on the record\nYou know you you mentioned that she's a songwriter songwriter and I think once again she's made the case on his record\nI Know you're a super fan and and I am not in a particularly grouchy mood today I just want you know I I'm hugely disappointed by this record I usually just hugely disappointed I'm a huge fan Phillip span especially\nThat nineties period of power pop effervescent ah what she's doing here it seems to me wait to Tom Waits want to be in\nThe sense of a I Am an eccentric who will now\nDabble in direct vile cabaret\nI mean that's what I ate about Tom Waits I'm I disagree with you about the drumming I think it's it's way over the top it's distracting\nThe strings bug me are veering between this cabaret and this sort of any more Coney thing at times\nUm I just don't think the music is up to the lyrics which has always are excellent I Would have preferred to hear these songs in much more strip down fashion which is what she gave us on the none such records or in her pop mode there are two pop gyms tears in the ground\nAnd how much is enough and the rest of the album or I go in there with her\nI've been having night no\nI'm not ...

in so many lives and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that Camille character encourages everybody to\nKind of sit back and go wait I'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record and see what happens and you can fly off and it will totally change your mood I think that's the importance of it\n\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though Susan you so did you ever have a conversation with the Elvis character and say why do you have such an expensive taste because licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they are notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music from or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV shows\nYou know when some are news that Led Zeppelin with his fantasy to be able to use it I don't know if we ever thought this would really happen but he put it in my hands and said if I could find anything for Allison Camille this would be what it was\nAnd I started working on that way before we started shooting and we started but really early conversations and working with a wonderful woman over Warner chop all you know we just kept shaping the letters than the communication until it became really clear\nThat you know when you look at episode three and you have that scene where Camille then\nTurns around and also shares you know helps young Alice in the painful moment going come on let's get outta here and she put some things you\nJust you\nCome to the city [noise]\nAny are just going\nWhy I spend almost time writing and making\nMusic which is in the end and I think that's not like you could go to let's go here let me give you a huge\nCheck so we can do whatever we want because it's never going to be about that for an hour is is always gonna be like how do you want it I'm sure there are a lot of the commercials and offered that definitely more money than they can imagine in the ... thank you I mean it really is about those artists looking at\nThe way that this music is affecting these characters in the way that show mark it takes such good care of music in terms of its authenticity about where it's coming from and feeling like okay and you know from them it's super smart because there's the demographics of the show\nA lot of them don't I've never heard they something you know there are so smart because this air it's their catalog and it helps people\nFind them and but more importantly it helps people realize the power of what their music and do in a painful moment and so it wasn't really you know people think like the difficulty was just having a lot of patience and trying to put across the why this was really important and they one day they just got it\nWhen we return music supervisor Susan Jacobs tells us more

on Greg God he's Jim jury got us and this week we're talking with music supervisor Susan Jacobs into thousands Seventeen Jacobs when the first\nEver Emmy for music supervision for work on the HBO mini series big little lies directed by John Mark ... and that show in particular Jacobs are profiled a lotta new artist and in many ways\nI think music some ... or the new talent scouts and the music world because they're introducing millions of people to relatively unknown artist\nI'm thinking of somebody like Michael ... whose song called little heart was the theme song to big little lies\nTo ration thing it's not about\nWhether the song is popular and are obviously ... has a certain cache Michael ... new\nFor a mainstream audience certainly [noise] so are you kind of feeling like oh I don't care about cash as much as I care about what the song\nIs saying and how it's going to work for this for this scene or this character of the show\nThe I'd always it's always what's going to convey the emotion that you want Michael ... was actually in big little lies in kind of fell apart so that was what was such an interesting discovery was that was sort of in a scene already and then sell\nUpwards into that title but when you look at the power of what that has done for his career and Leon Bridges career just went right back up on the charts and then you've got something like ... so then I thought it would come down\nAgain ... yeah ...\n... ah yeah\nKnow the newly\n... you know the\nAnd the acid with someone writes it's really exciting and I also think that's the power of housing market\nMusic because it it's an emotional it isn't just you know it's really he's a painter he's a waiver\nYou know he used his little bits of it here and there are so you hear that so enough to come down at the very beginning with them roller skating it's really cool but then it will keep coming around and around and and it it it ... as a people really feel\nLike they have a relationship with that song by the time we get to the end of the series I think that's what to me makes a big difference about\nHow it is and it's and it's always puts conveying the emotion that the director wants to convey as you know I always tell people music as a point of view are chopped his supervisors is to make sure that everybody's understanding the different points of view that are possible\nAnd for someone like John market's really working backwards from where he's trying to go with the characters because he's\nThis is how he this is him now I'm working with him that it more in the composer capacity that's just what we need to do here and we're going here and he's he's very clear about the emotions of ... what he wants to do and there's no nothing is in their casually\nI Want to talk
