{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "It is such a strange thing to have been so intricately involved in something and then to suddenly not being to watch it as an outsider and the other weird part was of course I had never met anyone involved with it other than ... so when I got to the Toronto film festival\nI was walking on stage for a panel and Michael Shannon\nTurned around and I was like I said that um I I wrote the film with ... and he was like oh no I mean they were all super friendly but it was absolutely bizarre because it was like hey I'm here I'm super\nRandom you have no idea who I Am and now we're going to be on stage and the the cast was the greatest they were so inclusive even that day I was like well what Vanessa and Guillermo did so well and I was like oh my God we've never met\nBut it it's weird it's definitely weird it's a choice you make you know [laughter] so you've gone from that world\nNow to a Latin some so you're you then went into the Disney University I mean that's a whole nother level not even people to act out\nIt was super fun to just be a part of it it just kind of walked in the door and I was like\nOh that sounds cool and it just turned out to be such a blast since I haven't known anything about musicals at one point I went to London and Ellen making the composer was there and they were all working in African Paul who did la la land and we're all going to work on the music and Allen was like oh have\nYou worked in musicals before and I was like no and I could tell he was like calculating like I Need her to understand what she has to do and the next day he came to me it was like see this scene it has like eight lines so there's only music for four lines and I was like OK cool can you put more music there\nAnd he was like no [laughter]\nI was like oh okay so there's going to be ... I got it [laughter] but it was really fun it was\nLike this great news sort of experience it was a blast\nCan you talk about the ... where the creature comes out of the tub and she's plugging the doors so that the room is going to fill with water was always in the movie so much of this imagery with water Guillermo had just had from the very beginning her floating in her apartment\nMost of the water scenes were dry for wet so they were shot in smoke and then water at it after the fact\nWhat film city have you watched for your education I don't think he had me watch any films he himself has talked about a documentary and I'm not going to remember the name that he watched and listen to that took place in Nineteen sixty two I think that was merely for sort of the ...\nVernacular of the time um but I did watch the Coen brothers' film Lou in Davis because he had mentioned it it takes place I think in the same year very close I wanted to watch it just in terms of tone to make sure I was understanding the reference he was making\nBut I really do wish I had watched creature from the black lagoon that's just ridiculous Guillermo has spoken often about the fact that he was so inspired by that film and that he thought I Believe he said when he was six and that he really was very hopeful that those characters were going to get together in a romantic way and that he felt like it had sort of been cheated and so now\nThis was his resolution of that love story\nAnd when you were writing the script or any of these people mentioned ... at all\nThen totally yeah he talked about from the very beginning he was like okay so it's Sally Hawkins and I talked to Sally about it he talked about Octavia he didn't talk about Richard because they think initially it was in ... but he talked about Michael Shannon so you know he had he had a pretty specific ideal already\nSo structure those really important for you\nDefinitely and I am not a natural structure so I've really painstakingly tried to improve my skills and it continues to be very very challenging but you know it's important when you look at something and it falls apart you know there are movies that don't need complicated structure hope springs had very little structure but\nMost of the time you can kind of identify a structural problem and part of what I think helps in that\nProcess is to give yourself permission to fail in a really big way\nAnd to be like today I wrote ten pages that are terrible\nAnd not to get down about it to be like that's part of the process I'm just looking for this thing I'll find it you know I just didn't I didn't find it today if you were telling it well each scene should need to be there so I think it's a matter of learning to feel that momentum unlike\nA person should be reading the script wanting to know what happens next if they hit a scene where they don't\nThat seems to do I'm really really inspired by Michael clayton the screenplay by Tony Gilroy and every time I read it I think oh I've got to write something just like Michael Clinton and then I think someone already wrote Michael clayton and I think I think I just want to be the person who wrote in Michael clayton [noise]\nBut I find it incredibly inspiring the fact that it even exists the fact that such a brilliant suspenseful film of such beauty and meaning exists makes me feel like okay there's like a shining goal out there what\nAre you looking to do now like we're what have you gotten from all these different experiences\nI really love film and I love the lifestyle of film like I Love everything about it everybody's head of the other way and I totally get why they are and partly I think you know the status of the writer is so much higher in television I was so much more important when I worked in television\nAnd you really get treated like you're the big boss and you really matter and on the films you are really treated like you do not matter\nBut I really love movies I Love the challenge of making the structure work once\nI don't need to make it work twenty six times are twelve times really for me it's about each project just being something that feels challenging that there's a little bit of a sense of like\nCan I Do is you know when I started game of Thrones I was really frightened but there's excitement in that too you know now I'm working on hillbilly elegy which is an adaptation of a memoir and so probably after that I'll look to do something quite different the\nReason I Love to work in sort of sigh fi and fantasy is because of that what if element I'm sure I'll I'll Try to go back to that but who knows I'm really open to what opportunity presents itself I've really recently been more into\nLet's just see what walks through the door you know I I was so lucky when ... a walk through the door and it was only because I was open to doing it and I wasn't so set on prior to that I think I had been much more like I have to do that so I'm trying to\nYou bet and then when I find is like whenever I don't know what I'm trying to do let's just see who shows up it became a much better happier experience\nOn stories brought you in
