through this thing together you know it was a real last minute last ditch effort and it became the iconic thing\nWe needed a title because under wasn't working so it was a Jesus ... of\nA predator nah that's not very good well let's let's just use it predator\nAll of a sudden the iconic you know all these things ... here and then he'd done this one film nobody so called nomads who is John material

Simon and George Packer kind of speaking with Fred stripe special advanced screening of the season finale pounded the fate theater in Austin as part of the twenty fourth Austin film festival\nAh oh\nI'm curious as to how you feel when you began a series and you know you had your first three episodes down did you know where you were going to end up and was this it\nDid we know exactly where every character was gonna know that's what the writing is for but\nIf you asked me what's supposed to happen in the end of the show yes we actually know the last sequence of laughing and\nWe'll start reading the beating of along for TV project until we know why we're writing it have a story is so yeah we know what's supposed to happen at the end of season three and the discovery of what you can put it in what season in which characters are going to occupy what space and that's that's for the riser\nSo there's only a certain amount of characters in the show that have\nPoint of view and what that means is that um some of the minor characters can have their own scenes where there's not a point of view character in the room\nAnd what that does the disciplines you\nAre in the writing so we give each person or group of persons so the police or\nYou know candy I'm CC that kind of thing they get a different color card into scarred\nAs we beat out the episode those cards go up when I'm bored and you can see because they're colored you can see a graphically if everybody's being represented then your episode that you want to be represented if it's if it's a global\nYou can't do it in your head and you can't do it when you're sitting at a typewriter you got to work before you get down to writing um\nBut even before you get to the cards\nYou've already asked yourself bigger existential questions about what what are you trying to show in the piece as a whole and in season one and in season two so pornography has to go from here to hear historically in this moment in this first season we know we're heading for example to that moment of the red carpet\nFor Deep Throat ah that that combination this episode so\nYou sort of backing up from that point of view ... hours what gets our characters to that moment of you know when when the pro premiered at the world theater in New York in Nineteen Seventy or Seventy two rather Seventy two and a and so you're\nBacking up from there but you know where you know where you're trying to get to\nShore in the course of doing episode five you may see that there's a need to advance this\nCharacter dramatically more than that character so maybe just pushed into six 'cause there's no room for it maybe this thing is we're done that was severely did and for\nAll that stuff is up for negotiation but you know at the end of the eight hour run you're heading towards this moment with this character this and you brought the characters on for that reason of you know they're serving story there not just there to be characters so it begins with the ... the awareness of what you're trying to accomplish in the eight hours\nAnd then from there you're sort of ... until you finally playing with the cars so\nWhat's interesting to me it's just such a ... a macho kind of showing some people's minds but you have half your directors were women obviously the um the woman is setting the template visually uh Michelle part the the third\nPart of this short a trinity on holy trinity George myself a need a noble who's been with me since Nineteen Ninety nine we've been working together so [noise] and she proved essential she's she began on the line producing side of things but here\nShe's incredibly engaged and all the creative levels including the dynamic of trying to um ... not written issues that try to talk the actors into anything that isn't right and and we're listening to what the actors are saying about sort of their\nNeeds and what what they're seeing and seeing what it has to be desk biofeedback going in both directions but need is a great conduit for that\nBecause she's a woman things can be probably said more bluntly and faster to needed into Georgia myself Georgian Ira said we're not like shrinking violet but\nJust probably stuff that can be said to a woman producer where a woman director more quickly and more cleanly and with a greater level of comfort so I think you know there's that you can't underestimate that and then all of a lot of so many of our department heads best but\nI Would say two thirds of our department has sort of the creative ones were women so that has to happen for the peace to work right\nBut then the other thing is everybody had to be the same page about why we were making it you know the existential reasons for making it you know there were various outcomes to Georgia and I were not only averse to but frightened of the moment that somebody says before Harvey and you know all and Donald Trump at\nThe moment if somebody stands up and says oh you know they they made porn to critique porn how clever and there's a lot of that on TV there's a lot of whole where our hearts\nTo visit you know um and there's a lot of ah going the other way which is about porn but we're so lost the and moralistic that we can look down on our characters sneer at these that these people who were locked you know there there was this confidence under pressure just as a\nExploitive system so you want to be able to pick that but at the same time if any moment you start to think you're better than the characters vets another suit somewhere in the middle you have to

Austin's NPR station K. U. T. N. K. U. T. H. D. one Austin\nThank you for this thing\nA lot of the interviews that you're hearing on on story were recorded that are the Austin film festival in this years twenty fifth oh Austin film festival for twenty Eighteen is ongoing right now through tomorrow for panels and then through Thursday for screening so there's still a chance to see something it's nine\nO'clock it's time for sound opinions why\n\n\nFrom WB easy Chicago NPR ... this is sound opinions on ...\nAnd I'm Jim T regattas with Halloween just around the corner will round up some of our favorite haunting songs from ... to go to the cure we've got a playlist to leave you terrified\nOf ... behind but she and her\n[noise]\nPlus we review that they view album from Greta Van fleet band do sounds like it's dressing up as Led Zeppelin for Halloween\nThat's all coming up on sound opinions from\nSome came in by email people were were ... comments about the show they just were given us great suggestions\nKevin in ... park out here in Illinois he said one of my favorite songs spooky or not is ghost town by the specials from the ghoulish mountains to the high pitch whales from a scary image painted up empty streets in closed down clubs\nTo the singles cover art work of skeletons playing the piano he loves the creepy vibe of this song he does note in in a joking manner that even scarier was that no doubt once covered it but we're going to the original version by the special one ghost town came out in Nineteen eighty one it was talking about\nShuttered streets unemployment urban unrest on the streets of London it was a heavy time and there were riots that erupted just as this song was coming out and making to the top of the chart\nAnd I think that's the scary thing about this song a city losing it so a city in an uproar here it is by the special ghost town on sound [noise]\n\n\nBall a little\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nGoes down by the specials are sound opinion is one of our scary ex for this Halloween [noise] but you got your next what are you got to chill is good when Jim one\nThe scariest aspects of this song is the fact that the singer Scott Walker once used to be in a group called the Walker brothers seeing music that was completely unlike when I'm about to play\nThe Walker brothers had a huge hit in the sixties called the sun shine anymore you can you do but and find out what that is all about and played that song and then late this next one I'm about to lay on you in the Gulf that's the same guy Scott Walker using that slush baritone crew in his voice in a more sinister fashion\nOn this song it's from his two thousand six I'm called the drift\nIn in this song he starts I was kind of this post nine eleven scenario and then it morphs into this meditation\nOn Elvis Presley in the womb of his mother lying next to his dead twin Jesse people don't realize this but maybe that Elvis Presley did actually have a twin who were stillborn\nAnd he's imagining this conversation it's actually a one way conversation Elvis talking to this this dead person lying next to him in the world and just that scenario alone creeps me out and that's quite a start but then he plays it out and you'll hear what happens next but basically it's it's a pretty existential piece of\nA music if you can call it pop music it's more leaning on experimental and classical music but it is among the darkest narratives I've ever seen in ops are Scott Walker was Jesse unsound opinions\n\n[noise]\nMhm\nMhm ...\n... [noise]\n[noise] ... ... do\nMm\nMm Mm [noise] Mm Mm Mm Mm\n\nOh\n\nWhoa\nWhoa whoa\nWhoa\nWhoa whoa\n\nWhoa whoa whoa\nYikes Scott Walker with Jesse unfounded opinions Mr ... you are a sick man when

Cleveland David welcome to the show I already got\nWere good we're getting in the mood for Halloween what song do you want to nominate\nA killing game by any ...\nThat's natural for Halloween\nWhen I heard the show last year I thought I got to get any puppies I'm how I think what the song at the piano they don't have a lot of piano and their song and you know right at the start to have that repeated single piano note and for me just that first seven seconds you could stop it right there and I'm already sort of\nHe doesn't really tell you who it is because of some cuts off just in time but you can guess I mean this is sympathy for the devil this is the Rolling Stone setting you know everywhere there's some mayhem happening I'm the guy at the heart of it all to pay fiasco put you on

deployment over the mountain to see my\nAnother fine Halloween choice put you on game by ... nice one Greg I ah him have got nobody to blame except myself for this one and you make Scott initially at this choice but I'm going with ... cc's I'm not in love watch\nCreepy about it for one thing the production Kevin godly and allow cream the driving forces in the early seventies English rock band are now much better known as an award winning video production team\nBack then they were just as inventive in the recording studio this initially started out as a falling out of love song with a bossa nova beat nothing too extraordinary they decided to take out the drums and to build a wall of rhythm from voices the former members of the ban each saying one\nAnd then over adopted an over dumped at an over dumped it until there were two hundred and fifty six voices singing the same note which gives this kind of robbing sensation\nIt seems pretty at first but it gets creepy or as the song goes on\nMen they really dropped the bomb with this apparently they turned to the studios receptionist and had her give the spoken word intro it in the middle of the big question cry\nBecause it's just creepy he said he's not in love I don't think he's going to be breathing much longer\nEither it's kind of in the spirit of that song Timothy ... you did a couple of years ago ... which was actually about cannibalism make little pop song about kind of what that is what ten cc's I'm not in love is for me here in our down to ...\nAh some no\nMy God oh\nGod I'm\nNo no no no no oh\n\nNo no no\nI'm not in love from ten cc a interesting Troy Jim I wouldn't have thought of that is a scary Halloween son but the I could see the uh the sinister undertow there is the big boys don't cry really horrified\nOr we're going to go to some more of our ... critics for\nTheir choices break is from Philadelphia workers are finished ranked ethics rapidly so we're talking about spooky tunes for this season what are you got to choose\nOur for me it's common ground by sonic you\nSound like you've got the number of storms that might qualify for this why that one in particular\nUm because it's a love song and it just when you listen to it it just sounds scary the way they sing it and the way the guitars are like just like timing and groaning and yeah but when when it came out I was in college and\nTo me love was you know the scariest thing I could think of the time I got a turtle yelling at three\n\nSo you heard that song back in the day when love with the new thing for you and uh this this turned you off the whole concept of ...\n[laughter] I think more than it connected with whatever they are already feeling I'm like no love songs really express right but I was feeling and then that one did\n... Oh thanks for having me\nOkay great we've got one final listener on the line Stacey isn't gardener North Carolina\nState year there you're right about your favorite song for Halloween\nWell it's not a definitely a traditional Halloween sign it doesn't have a lot of traditional Halloween content but it deep red bell I make a case and he said in interviews that it sort of a reflection of how she felt growing up in Washington state\nWhile the Green River killer with its um it kinda murder song and that that kind of keep me\nMe\nMe\n\n\nShe does have that's industry ... her but she even just no she likes horror movies in our novels and she likes scaring people yes and why this song in particular\nIt's just every boy such as a reason I take a big fan of hers but on the imagery in that town and she kind of engagements off I tend to ... there's a line about hedge translate driver's side and there's a course how is\nHe right now but the thing that really gets me is there's a line that says that you're so without like an old paper bag test and see what the early grades that just gives me the Willie every time it's just such a great in age does your", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "28"}
