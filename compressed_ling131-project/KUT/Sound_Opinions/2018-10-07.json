{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "[laughter] so much money is being spent at some point somebody's gonna go\nHey we just figure something out absolutely no one watched that thing that we spend a hundred million dollars in person the ratings are really easy to calculate it was zero so we [laughter]\nIs selling new you know getting new subscribers all the time but\nI don't know I mean they're paying Adam Sandler the same amount of money that he made ten years ago actually more than he made ten years ago when he was filling up fears with Thirteen or fourteen year old kids and they were jammed packed\nAnd now he's doing that on Netflix and I wonder like aren't as many people watching it now I don't know how could they possibly be paying and the same amount that that he was getting paid back when the movie theaters where you know big business I don't get it by this game\nAnd features you know I feel like I'll sequels and and and and ... and all that and television and now there's so much of it it's all ... I found out that that's the bad word for any TV I Want to be noisy\nThere's so much um that's out in front of us and its cannot show find a way into your head and it kind of break through 'em all of the other things that are filtering into our consciousness and our attention but\nYou're absolutely right like I'll go on Netflix you don't see like blade sisters of what three seasons\n[laughter] you know\nOr do you know that the grim has like seven seasons now grim\nI've never I I guess it's on network even and you just don't ... I guess someone must be watching this [noise] I don't know but there's too much you know it's a glut I just I really feel that fewer movies are being made and it's all sequels and I just feel like the investment people making P. N. A.\nAnd distribution\nThey're not willing anymore\nTo get excited over respect script sale now having said that you should all go out and write a spec stripped [laughter] because it's a calling card and it might get made but if it doesn't it'll get your work\nIs there are worlds you'd be interested in working in writing that someone else has created the irony is that I was very devoted to the concept and the the original material\nOf Iron Man and also their interpretation through wonderful actor of what our men that became and send them up\nAnd I really tried I was loving the notion of playing in that field\nAnd one of the things we decided on was that rather than take literal interpretation of a villain called the Mandarin\nThat since he's the product of a think tank called a I Am from the comics what if he were just sort of a a cobbled together almost computer generated terrorists that they use market research to find what we are afraid of and actually fulfilled our worst fears on the Internet with this sort of\nYou know air SATs terrorist threat and we liked the idea\nI got an email not long ago which was a picture of me being [noise]\nTo buy the Mandarin [noise]\nAnd it's like a I've ever you don't make any more movies you son of a K well you know I wasn't going to do anyway but now that uh you said that I Will [laughter]\n[noise]\nBut I we really try to just do something interesting and it it's out of law you know it's out of love for the material but\nThe fans sometimes are so rapid and that's the danger of sequels fans loved the original so you stepped very carefully and veer at your risk but you have to fear\nYeah I've been lucky in the sand boxes that ah I've been offered the opportunity to plan and I\nLook I I don't think I've ever met a sand box I didn't on some level want to play in but the thing about sand box is is that animals getting them [laughter] thing sometimes there are landmines they're dead bodies it's um\nIt can be dangerous and you know it there's value I think in saying yes to that\nAs part of what we do but it's more important to retreat and create our own sandbox\nSo how do you approach the pitching indoor integration of your vision in the intellectual property process if any of these kinds of projects and\nThat so I had a a circuitous unexpected route into this career and in one of the things I did before I arrived here was a I was a civilian contractor working for the chief of naval operations I I have a deep seated love for the United States Navy I I Love that\nFilm I I think in many ways the original top gun was transformative I mean if you just look at the way that Tony Scott shot\nThat movie nobody had tried to shoot a military action adventure movie in that way before that really made it feel like\nYou were there so I had a lot of affection for it\nAnd as as somebody who had spent some time in that world or I felt like I had things to say like there were stories to tell about aviators about the threats that we were facing about\nJust the psychology of fighter pilots drone pilots and all of this guy so um it was there was a lot in my own personal back\nStory I I think that that I wanted to explore\nAnd then the thing I'll say about marvel as they actually are they like to try to innovate a little they'll they'll you'll hit a wall at some point they'll say All right that's too much you know but they do like to play I think they know what they're doing over there I think Kevin pike is a very smart man so\nWe absolutely had some freedom and some wiggle room um but\nYou know you just you just push it and and try to get what you can out of it there's a\nLine in the movie where a little kid Tony Stark or talking and\nUh the kid uses where's your dad and the kids as well he went up to a seven eleven to get scratch yours you know I guess he must have one 'cause I was five years ago and the audience goes oh and then Tony says yeah well dad's leave no reason to be about it so that [laughter]\nHere's what I Need you know\nAnd the studios that cannot go in the movie that cannot go in the movie but we we talk them into it they screened it and it was consistently the biggest lab so that's what you need is just someone who plays well with you a little bit just a little bit [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nStories brought you in part by the Alice Claiborne Reynolds

neighborhood of Chicago or mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene are collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation Greg Mick Jenkins chance the rapper\nDonny Trump at the social experiment meal of woods or twenty sixteen got a lot of notice for her first\nMix tape as a solo artist telephone\nNow comes a full album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also

five gym a lot of discussion about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what do you call yourself known as the question she gets asked\nA lot of interviews and you know I think she's trying to addressing that in this record um the whole idea of identity what does it mean up I think the subtext of almost every track on this record is that society tries to a race African American people tried to make them invisible\nWomen's I've been especially yes and you know stripping of your pride your dignity your identity that's that's the essence of life or so she becomes known him and embraces this\nReality and and turned it into an empowering thing you know one of the key lines on the album is because when we walk into heaven nobody's named going to exist like\nYou know we're we're all equal there yeah I Know the other thing the album titled route twenty five that's about her turning twenty five and this transition she has in her life about moving from Chicago to\nLos Angeles and essentially reinventing herself in the track windows you know she says quit looking out the window go find yourself in this with this record is about [noise]\nYou know leave your your comfortable surroundings go find who you truly are in another part of the world and that's essentially\nWhat she's doing here is she she comes from a heavy duty poetry background you know the the spoken word seeing\nUm she's a poet first she wouldn't say these lyrics are poetry but they are poetic when I hear her rap I'm thinking of like little tributaries you know ... diving off this river and you can follow any one of those down and you will get a whole different layer to the song\nSo every time I listen to her music I get different layers um because there's so much new ones in in what she's talking about and the backing tracks um you know she recorded a bunch of music ... who's a really um a inventive artist and now she's working with this artist Felix on this record and it reminds me a lot of that\nEarly nineties New York city hip hop scene a tribe called quest lied guru I'm very jazz jazz oriented kind of a news that you know I'm I'm getting comments like water for chocolate that's ... that's where I was going to say the next thing the other stuff was that sort of neo soul yeah the late nineties stuff the Angelo\n... gets a shout out on this record [noise] team and I think I mean\nYou know I Love that line about maybe this is the um you listen to in your car when you're driving home late at night and that's exactly what this album is Greg or you're covering all the bases there a couple of things you might have missed\nWhen NO NAME moved to Los Angeles she hooked up with the up and coming underground comedy scene so there is a lot\nOf humor in this record there's also a lot of Frank nest and honesty room twenty five she was twenty five years old she is also said she lost her virginity sometimes I think she's a little frightened about this coming of age\nUh into adulthood as a sexual being on the other side of the country from where she grew up\nUm I I think it's this is a brilliant album or as much musically as lyrical early you know and and NO
