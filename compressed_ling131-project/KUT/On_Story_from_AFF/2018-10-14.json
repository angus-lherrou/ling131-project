U. T. dot O. R. G. from the below Center for new media at the University of Texas this is Austin's NPR station K. U. T.\nK. U. T. H. D. one Austin we are you're central Texas home for NPR and the BBC I'm sure you heard on the eight o'clock will be having a great friday and I'm Sorry grapes Saturday fabulous\n\nYou're listening to an story from Austin film festival NPR on on your has far from where\nWe hear from two of the writers behind the shape of water which was simultaneously as a novel ... down to New York times best selling author Daniel ... originally approached me and my dad was a story about a sea creature locked in a laboratory patient an idea he had when he was Eighteen years old [noise]\nIf I had to be sort of ...\nOr so and it was very racist\nCreature from a black lab like this stuff is just a relationship with the facts or break it out\nFor dinner and later we'll hear from screenwriter financial Taylor coverage to film version of the shape of water and lift nominated for an Academy Award for best original screenplay I Am\nChallenged every single time I've never met the screenplay that was easy to write a story from Austin film festival NPR I Will be back in a moment\nIt's conversation Leah came up and I started out you know I haven't I've always had this neat idea you might like that's what I told them just what I I just told you that a couple of friends from this and he said uh that's beautiful I think those were his words so I kept trying to drag it back to throw herders flipping it back to the shape of water\nAnd he started throwing out ideas who say well you know what if this would have\nHad something to do the Cold War you know within a couple of minutes probably ugly bringing up he said when an option is idea this was my next movie so that was a weird exciting moments but also the idea's good option to all the time I didn't really expect it to happen and it really didn't for a while he isn't actually we went on to be ...\nAnd because I kind of thought it was would never happen that continued to sort of a lone develop the idea I Kennedy was not one or two of my list because I was reading the books but I was still developing it occasionally jotting down in ...\nAnd then I guess it would be a couple of years ago when suddenly the whole idea of the movie pick up a lot of steam and everyone was suddenly in touch with everyone and it became clear that game I really wanted to make this movie\nSo it'll ... together or write the book together I'll make the movie and uh everybody wins and there'll be kinda cool live this movie in a book about the same time and it was a really cool idea it was a different idea it's not really an ...\nNormal way but in this case it much more complicated it was my of a general idea that then he added to his idea and then she developed\nThe clock but then I could take all this other stuff but I Do sort of you out of your notes down for a couple of years and then stole that into his client is criminal but it's unusual it's sort of this weird you know this very unique\nCombination of both of our idea is to be clear though the book is getting one eyes at the movie is have I did not write the script because it was all happening so fast that I really needed to focus on the book because the both in the movie are being developed find the tiniest\nOriginally are going to collect the same time but then there were taught that well maybe that's too much\nAnd then the movie started getting you know one it rather than an infant started getting all this claim so they're like All right let's let's do something that I almost never done that type of movie come out before the book to read a book comes out first but I'm not really sure why there has to be that's\nHow people would generally find this look anyway even if had come at first they probably would still do it via the movie so the timing move you'd be good data that much\nWhen you're developing a different project out as a similar idea how do you separate the mind of the book from the movie especially when the movie has had such critical and popular appeal\nIt was easy because the movie didn't exist when I was right when he was being created by now\nClay of like a because it was a movie they still make it there was no none of that pressure and none of that that sense does the movie being somehow primary to the book because most people thought this was going to be really cool movie the aerobics\nBut it is that the other day based on his there's are a lot about a woman or man and the chances of that I mean a huge like global phenomena are pretty well\nSince I'm an audience perspective though somebody seen the movie ... nations still read the book because they're not going to be seeing the same project necessarily\nGenerally most of the plot point or the same but not all of them there's additional characters that our characters that are very very minor in the movie their major in the book\nUm there are things that I was planning separately that I was able to leave and so yeah I think you could watch the movie first and read the book and read the book first one movie and it's going to feel like any other book\nAnd movie adaptation\nSo let's talk a little bit about the living dead which is the book that George mirror was working on 'em and then passed away so it's an changed\nAnd ah you were approached by against his state's right to finish this yeah how did that come about you talked about them finding you does that give you a little pause here I mean he's so I kind of like the\nOnly job I ever really been qualified or in my life is finishing this book everything else I've done have not been qualified for it but I Will be qualified for this the first movie I ever remember seeing was a little data darned her dad\nTaught me about a movie is going to have some tax art subject these were critical tax too many George was more than my favorite filmmaker he was my favorite artists and possibly the reason that I was\nInterested in any art so to have this opportunity is an extremely exciting one but it's also very moving to me I I've had suffered intensely intimate relationship because his work for so long that a fair to contribute to it to sort of\nEscort his final work is really an honor\nThose who is this going to be finishing a book and then a property that goes on to become a film afterwards\nThere would be a certain identity to that\nYou know George famously had trouble with the studio system in ... and even when he was armies became a big thing with the walking dead and so forth\nHe could never really get studios to give him a big budget and the rare times that they did get really bad experience so you turn to this book to put down all his really big ideas studios would never fund if the book does end up ever being turned into a movie if there's a sort of dark I only their\nInterest you really don't do screen writing is there a reason why you've avoided jumping into that world is screen writing so like the seat or\nWhen I sort of switched from during documentaries to books I really just wanted to focus on a book\nTo sort of get good at it so there were opportunities that popped up over the years for screenplays I generally just turn them down that has sort of a body of work that I wanted to establish a novel all that said I Am working on a few different screenplays right now with various parties that I Can't talk about yeah so I Am I Am back in it now\nYou did a lot of editing work it seems like the editing might have been a great way of owning your storytelling skills did that work that way for you\nI mean the editing is possibly the most crucial part of the question is do you have the discipline to keep writing desk today and do you have the discipline\nTo edit because as every film editor knows you watch the same few seconds over and over hundreds of times I think we're craftsmen story was riding or working with raw documentary shortage\nOr you you are faced with the same question of dealing with your instincts to create a store to shape the story from either raw footage that you filmed or why here and they have\nSo there's yeah there's some similarities I couldn't quite choreographed affair\nYou know in some ways of making a documentary was sort of a pressure release I'm ready and vice versa they operated from such different parts of the brain that I think they were more like cleaning up their power what does

the legendary nine to living Danielle maker George ...\nIs scheduled to be released sometime next year [noise]\n\n\nOne of my favorite creature feature movies of all time was creature from the black lagoon what attracted you to that story you know I'd say it is a classic movie\nI think the cushion of Black Lagoon is attractive to anyone who has a developed or maybe over developed sense of empathy because the league plays out like the creature is the bad guy you're supposed to be rooting for these people who are hunting you basically\nBut if you pet any you know tenderness in your heart\nIs really difficult to watch that movie and not feel terrible for the creature he's doing virtually nothing wrong and needs cruel humans come down and they just on him relentlessly and Kuhn him and poison him and I think as a kid that's Grover the connection is that I have sympathy for the creature\nSure I was aware we were starting work and the person who was my contact with him was like OK succumb to the next meeting and bring your pages and I was like my pages of what so I just started writing pages off the outline and it was really fun in the beginning I was sort of trying to guess at the tone it how did you\nGet into that groove and writing in a tone that really when\nMore in his mind the period element help and he talked to me about being inspired by the work of the Coen brothers and I kind of got the idea that what he meant was we were writing a movie about these two people who can't talk to their silence and then all around them there's all this talk\nWhich is very specific and interesting but not the emotional core of the film core of the film is silent\nAnd so that to me really made sense and made me and and he talked a lot about sort of why he set it in the particular time period and certain things about that and so I felt like I had a good ... understanding of what he was looking for in order to color in what all that talk was\nBut I just really enjoyed it I found it sort of fun and very flavorful to have all this sort of weird sixties talk about whatever it was Cold War they were talking about I knew from the very beginning like it just had a fun to it\nWhere did all of this character development come from for all the talking people how did that back story developed all around them talking about that\nHe talked about the idea that this was about all these outsiders at one point I tried to sort of dig in and be like now specifically are these military people like what's their relationship to each other what branch of the military or are they in who they reporting to what actually doing and as soon as I asked him the questions I realize like oh\nI've taken all the magic out of his thing like he's really he was sort of like you know\nAnd I just thought oh never mind forget it like I'll just make it up and if it's wrong he'll tell me after that\nI just worked on it more from the perspective of like I think this guy is with these black fingers\nAnd like he's just a horrible person but\nHe believes in the future and like it was more of a feeling in a theme at that\nPoint because I thought oh I get it he wants it to be more on that he wants has got to represent something as opposed to be a very specific sort of figure and that's in that way having it be a fairy tale was so freeing because I felt like well that's okay like in a fairy tale doesn't matter like I don't care if he's a marine or who he is like it it really could be anything\nBut he seemed to have really a lot of the very humor full scenes in the film I mean how did you use him you feels like you use them as the backbone for this story that's going on around the silence\nI Would say that some of that humor came later in the process as Guillermo was heading into production as I was writing Strickland I feel like he was a little bit darker and I think ... sort of lightened him up later on to maybe add\nTonal variation and and to get it something more specific about that time period in my mind he was just this sort of really dark\nGuy with a cattle fraud and I really liked I I feel like in some ways I may have gone a little too dark because I was so excited about our dark it was I just kind of enjoy the purity of his nastiness and the specificity of it\nLook those are all over again is ... ... to July the jerk you know\nThey're strict with your with you [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nOh no no marijuana than before or after turning to his needs tells you a loan though he doesn't both arms orange to witness incurred [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt was very pleasant driving\nSo your process of working with him was really interesting you moved into a completely different way of writing with him but it was co writing for sure so can you talk about how you guys were that process because I don't think that's the norm al\n... I think it is the norm for him and I actually really enjoyed it but at first I was surprised by it and sort of confused so like I said I turned in these pages and then he turned in some pages and then we sort of went back and forth until there was a full draft and then\nAfter that we would go back and forth with the draft and he explained to me the process which is like if you have the script I don't write anything if I have the script you don't write anything\nSo he was like tax me or call me I guess emailed me on like a Wednesday and say you'll get the script tomorrow I Want to back Monday and so I only ever had four or five days at a time it was really\nInteresting because I felt like in much the way sort of David and Dan taught me that you don't have to be so complicated and laborious\nYear taught me that you don't need as much time as you think you do and I would ask him what are the parameters of my draft so do you want to polish the wonderful revision I can tell you what I think you want or need but what do you want then I was so I Would send it back to him and I couldn't hear anything for like a month\nAnd I was like I don't know maybe I was five years\nAgo um and then I'd\nGet an email tomorrow you will have the script so that was out what\nHe's such a visionary director and I would imagine an awful lot of what he is envisioning is not on the page how did you work within that do to try to be meeting you know what you think is going to happen\nI think he described all the actions that you see what he couldn't have described your didn't described to you is that like there's all this color coding and the movies and there are all these filmic references some of them to films I've never seen and didn't know were being referred to end the phone\nSo there are times when I wished I had been in more communication with him so I could have known about things I Know that was tripping over but I'm positive that that was purposeful on his part because he didn't need me to embrace whatever he was referring to he needed my perspective on the writing of the script\nSo you had this great comfortable collaboration somebody in a unique way of working what do you think about each of you contributed to that being such a positive collaboration\nI sort of saw it as a challenge and a bonus to be in this strange collaboration where we weren't having a lot of conversations I don't think he wanted me to be even though I feel like now in hindsight like a tripped over all the things that I didn't know he was doing I think he needed someone confident to be in that partnership\nBut he is just an incredibly generous in eagle less artist himself and I I think probably that's what makes these things possible\nWhat are some of the scenes in that movie or pieces that she felt added to it that were in his original twenty some pages\nI loved writing struggling not all my stuff stuck but I wrote scenes for him that we didn't even need because I was like oh he's so great I just want to see them do these terrible things\nAnd I also thought at a certain point he had such a weird scenes in there sometimes and I thought ... needs me to be equally creative an unrestrained so I Would just toss in these crazy seems to be like the\nLook I can be crazy you know but I felt like he really was asking for a level of freedom and sort of unrestrained creativity that if I didn't try to match it if I was a bold about it and saying hey I might fall on my face but here's this crazy thing that I Would really be letting him\nOn story from Austin film festival and here I Will be back in a moment\nAnd you're listening to on story here on can you see your point five support comes from with strong presenting the whip strong challenge bike ride and one mile run walk on October twenty first\nFunds raised go to the whip strong Cancer Institute said UT Austin more info at live strong challenge dot org as KU teeth\nMembership Dr approaches we are at a headlong sprint to the November election and will continue to bring you Congress stations and news for every one voices from fellow Americans on all sides of the political like from that can help you make of your mind about issues and candidate\nYour financial get help strengthen this ...\n... people and ideas can ... and allowed that to bring you the\nThanking lanes helping keep our on our membership drives shortened by making your guest today at K.
