{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Well about six years ago um I was invited on another high it was a first date with my partner who I Am still west\nAnd I still felt like I didn't know what I was doing I was wearing club where because that's the only close that I had what what does that mean like I was wearing like a a leopard spandex drafts and tights and cowboy boots and I had a full face of makeup and\nYou know I felt self conscious and and kind of you know insecure about my breathing my sweating whatever but\nI it was it was such a transformative experience like I felt like something happened that day that opened me up to this new world I needed something new and this was a new thing I\nUh for a lot of us who fit into the kind of majority I'm you know a white straight dude I'm\nSpoiler alert for people who've only listen to the radio show um they would never occur to those of us who are in the sort of ... majority sis world whatever that it would not feel like a welcoming place for some people to go out into the outdoors like explain what that experience was like for for people who don't maybe speak that stuff out because we don't feel like it's welcoming to\nThat yeah well you know living in Portland you know everybody has er everybody seems to have this sort of\nRelationship with the outdoors this sort of access and the thing is is when you don't fear ... yourself represented and outdoors the media social media ads or whatever\nIt it doesn't feel like an invitation like I never saw myself represented in outdoors culture as a fact we're person so I wanted to tell another story about the outdoors I wanted to tell mine and also the stories of other people who are being included\nSo how do you go about doing that like ... you get together with folks you go on hikes you put it on social media what is actually look like\nYeah I shortly after started a blog a personal blog where I talked about my journey to hiking and all of the things I found as a a a fat queer hiker um because there is not a lot of gear and things like that for ... people and so I wanted to share the information also shared just how\nThis was all going about and what not\nUm early on I call myself an unlikely hiker in a piece and people just kind of grabbed onto it I didn't think anything of it but\nThere are people were asking me what are you going to do with this so I started unlikely hikers less than two years ago and a shortly thereafter I started leading group hikes all around Portland but now also nationwide\nUm and all kinds of folks show up for my ... people of all gender sexuality is you know races ethnicities like you know it's amazing\nWhat do you hear from the folks who are out there who are showing up like for the first time or in the outdoors like what is it what does it seem like it's like for them\nYou know there's this common thread of vulnerability and that might be really surprising to people who have an innate sense says access\nBut a lot of people feel like they can finally let their hair down the themselves that they're in safer supportive spaces and they're saying things like I always needed something like this but I didn't know how to find it\nWell how do people find out about an unlikely hike near them or you can find out about unlikely hikers group hikes on Instagram profile at unlikely hikers and my

story look inside the\nCreative process from today's leading writers and tell me how far from Oregon this week in honor of Austin film festival twenty fifth anniversary\nBack into our our highest bring these conversations with writers that created to of Nineteen Ninety three nice remembered first we'll hear from screenwriter Angela ... show\nAt the inspirational football drama Rudy\nRudy ... on his own way I don't have with our anybody's help and later we'll hear from Ron nice liner Rosa Jonathan demi directed drama Philadelphia are dead now Washington\nAnd Tom Hanks every movie every movie I think every Greeks going just relationship to\nCentral relationship\nBetween Tom Hanks character Andrew Denzel Washington character Joe on stories from Austin film festival NPR I Will be back in a moment\nAnd um people discovered it and started talking about it so I had a word of mouth but a not a theatrically it's even worse now if you don't perform out of the box you are gone there's too many other movies waiting the wings to to jump in there and um I gave a talk one time\nTo a crowd of about four hundred people and\nIt was an Indiana but ah it was an Indianapolis and people are coming up to Maine talking about Rudy on and on and on and uh so I said I ask how many people in the in the place and seeing Rudy and just about every hand went up I ask how many people saw it in\nThe theater about five hands went up so I Hope that doesn't happen art with our new movie that people discover later\nBut I'm here's what I'll share an answer to your question about why it resonates it and why it is staying over the years is because it's extremely reliable to a broad spectrum of people\nNow I in order for me to write any screenplay take on anything I'm I Need to connect personally to it\nAnd um when I first got involved in the film business or or thought about it being involved in film business there were a lot of people telling me you're crazy it's I mean hundred thousand scripts registered with the Writers Guild every year or two hundred films getting made a\nIt's like winning the lottery you know how can you I mean it's a so incredibly competitive and only the sharks went out in the end and uh\nAnd I came to realize in the course of\nWorking my way through the business because I was an executive for the first six years and then started doing this film making thing\nThat is that the people the men and women who are successful in the business where people like Rudy they were people who did not personalize the word now who\nWere so resilient after hearing no no no no no constantly because as someone this as a scribe being in the film business like swimming in a sea of nose and your desperately trying to find that one island to BS\nTo get really to the heart of your question why is reliable is that it's not about football it's certainly not about Notre Dame it's about someone who takes over power of definition of self in other words\nHe doesn't give it away he doesn't let other people tell him what he can and can't do to other people tell him what he's capable of not capable of and sometimes they even his father who loves him was telling the don't I don't want you to be hurt by going into this situation when when Rudy found his own way and his own path\nWas out anybody's help and and and I think I've heard a lot from a lot of people who say they get depressed and watch this movie and they they get a sense of hope you know because Rudy wasn't valued\nRoute where do you didn't have any innate skills he wasn't a somebody who was even seen he kind of blended into the the woodwork uh he uh he wasn't big fast he wasn't athletic he wasn't smart\nIf he hadn't basically a curriculum V. tie up zero or in high school and yet he came up with this hair brain idea they usually played football at Notre Dame and he never let it go and I think that people have\nThat secret dream and I think that it's an inspiration for a lot of people and I think it's very reliable and that way\nMy father loves Notre Dame football more than anything else in the world he doesn't believe him on the team because you can't see me at the sidelines during the games\nNext year my senior year I'd love to be able to give him his gift\nI really appreciate it if you could let me just one game look Rudy\nAnd see a really hamstrings us with the sixty route instead of his issues we only have one Vaca\nAnd you know every year with ... for the national championship [noise]\nIs this just for your father [noise]\nNotes for everybody who told me that the the Notre Dame football there would be impossible for my brother's\nKids in my high school the guys I work with it the ... [noise]\nThey can't come to practice and see that I Am part of the team [noise]\n\nOf\nCourse when you're telling a true story which you've done before I mean you're done multiple times certainly you've got to discern what you can tell the way it happened and what you have to ah change for dramatic purposes and I'm Wondering what you may have changed in this story and why you made the choice to to change to make things more dramatic\nWell as you know people's lives don't lay out and pretty natural acts so are you there is compression there's expansion and there's composite siding with the characters\nAnd I'll give you an example of the compression when Rudy ah got out of the ... when he graduated from high school he didn't go to Notre Dame right away or he didn't get it in the bus and go there when he did was he joined the navy and he was a navy for three\nYears uh then he came back and worked in the steel mill and his best friend did get killed his best friend and he talked about his dream all that was true and he went to Notre Dame and met that the priest who gave them the idea of going to Holy Cross all that was true\n... a greater tragedy in the war I wanted to run out of that\nTunnel from my dad to prove what\nOh he was so full of crap you're not a hundred and\nAnd you got medical billing and you even land to here and you're also going to walk out of hand with a degree from the University of Notre Dame and it's like\nTo go out to prove nothing to nobody except yourself and what you've gone through if you haven't done that by now it ain't gonna never\nBeen as far as the Charles Dutton character the grounds\nKeeper that was a composite of three different people who helped him along the way there was a grounds keeper and there was a janitor and the the Joyce bill Joyce Hall which was the basketball arena and he gave him a janitors a room to sleep in so I just melt it all those characters\nInto one and there was a third character I Can't really remember right now\nAre there John ... character\nWas was his best friend that was ... was true there was a little bit of a ... I guess [laughter] ah with coach divine who was upset about about this movie he wasn't upset about it when I talk to him\nBecause I when I Do it did research I'm ... I spent a long time talking to him and all that was true he did the coach from tower he wasn't a player's coach he uh there were a lot of people love dirty and he wasn't one of them and ah\nHe just didn't care it wasn't that he disliked him and a lot of people\nBesieged him to to dress Rudy and and the player to and they did resist now the scene that upset his family I told coach divine that was going to do the same but at an upset his family and that was that ah when the players came in with their jerseys and laid them on the desk\nWhich has family felt was humiliating and disrespectful but\nWhat that was was a visual corral day of something else that happened which was there were\nA whole I think there was anywhere from five to ten to Fifteen I Can't remember seniors that went to the defensive coordinator Jo yawn toe and said they wanted to give their Jersey a variety\nSo what I tried to do is it's it's a legal axiom if I didn't get the letter of the truth I wanted to get the spirit of the true\nStory from Austin film festival here I Will be back in ...\n[noise]\nThis is Katie nine point five I'm Tracey ... thank you so much for listening and the Austin film festival where these were recorded is taking place next weekend in case you're curious\nThe league of women voters Austin area remind listeners that election day is November six and early voting starts Monday leaks free non person ... guide is available at public libraries and Travis Williamson county in and vote for one one dot org you get that information right now\nSupport comes from the ... trading company international folk art jewelry and textiles to explore discover share and may treasures from around the world open daily at Fifteen hundred south Congress and the ... dot com\nPacey would like to thank for solving business three ...

I've tested this movie I've played just opening for people who've never seen the movie and I stopped at about five minutes and\nThen I said tell me what's happening what's going on in this movie and people can tell me exactly what the story is so what happens is that we tell the story of kitty being found with her love her how she fell in love why she married Walter\nIt's all done in flashbacks and she's being carried and one of those lawn chairs they used to call it you know on the backs of Chinese guys and she's being like this and she's ... she's upset and we just keep going into her mind and it was great because we've got to meet our main character in stress and interests\nWhen she's being victimized by her husband as opposed to the other way around and then we get to play with your sympathy because you're immediately sympathetic for her you know who but then as you learn their story and you see how cruel she was to him than just sympathy changes so that was an example where summers that mom was right for the novel\nAnd we had to adapt we had to ... we had to correct it for the movie so it sounds like a note you need to separate the advice from like\nThe problem that they're trying to solve you know I I wrote a movie called ... I I wrote Philadelphia as you know and uh\nSome of you seen the movie Philadelphia\n[noise] yes [noise] so [noise]\nThere is a scene in it and which Tom Hanks recites the lines of an opera arias stance of Washington it is in many people's minds it's uh the best scene and somebody a fire somebody who does it listed as one to one hundred most best scenes in American movies or something like that\nThat will change again when\n\nWhen it went into the script every body hated it and\nA lot of executives at the studio a lot of people that we just asked to read the script there were a gay executives at the studio who were like really offended because what a stereotype like all of us gay guys was the opera [laughter]\nAnd Jonathan Gemini ... I just remember it was so shocking because I wrote it just happened like that and it went in\nAnd and I usually don't write like that you've heard my whole long thing about all the research I Do know that one just went and I was actually listening to that opera arias in my house one morning I and I started I tell the story I started crying\nAnd my lawnmower guy knocked I Lived in upstate New York and so I'm knocked at my door and I thought he had looked through the window and seen me and\nI had this intense moment of shame which it was self hatred and it was it was a homo gay man's self hatred and I was thinking oh look at you used to see senior crying listening to opera and now Russell the lawnmower guy whose opinion obviously must means so much to me [laughter]\nIs seen you he's senior secret\nYou're gay and I realize that's what this movie is about and so I just wrote it I just really like and he Tom Hanks type puts on this opera area\nAnd he gets all emotional and what does that do to the straight guy and like that's fantastic that just goes right in Jonathan demi red and said he looked up and he said Ron I don't know if we can do this to an audience\nHe said it's I don't know this maybe he lied and but everybody have we had memos people hate opera blah blah blah blah blah can't like can we do a pop song [laughter]\nCan't we get Madonna to do something [laughter]\nThat's real folks and I remember that Johnson I mean that we have a stack of memos like this or you know and I had like ... and the the ones from the gay executives calling me like a traitor\nTo the tribe and he looked at me and said do you like the scene I say I love the scene says so do I do them [noise]\nAnd and now of course he'd won five Oscars for silence civil am so he has the right to say that and it went right in and that's how you never had a moment's doubt about that scene was Tom Hanks\nWho said that ... instead of course that's why I wanted to do the role now my show runner Andre Donovan we can segue to re Donovan Michael my show runner and bitter man who created re Donovan you know and really she has she she doesn't care what you like she doesn't care what the network likes she didn't really care that much about what the other writers in the room liked or\nAt least that was her approach or she didn't care if the actors like the dialogue there'll be asked being asked to speak she has a very sort of strong intuition about what she does now that does not mean that she did not need the four of us are writing staff\nOften wrestling wrestling with that intuition correcting it in some cases just disagreeing behemoth when he was in some cases frequently maybe occasionally so frequently winning she knows she's not immovable 'cause you know oh that would be suicidal\nAnd our business but she has a very strong sense it's in some ways and writes exactly what and wants to see and you guys like to to you know that she's lucky\nFor on foreign culturally all on their ...
