o'clock\n[noise] you're listening to on stories from Austin film festival NPR on I'm your host\nBaltimore on this week telling the story we're exploring sequels and reduce virtual here from writer director Shane Black on his latest film the predator if you're not a little bit tortured over there might be an issue at the same time I've learned not to be afraid of the torture of freedom trying\n'cause I used to be so scared of field now we don't care if I feel as long as I'm Out there making an effort\nIn the show we'll hear from the writers behind the sequels and reduce of hits like dumb and dumber\nFirst class valley girl and predator [noise] but I think the essential thing for a remake is for there to be a reason for it to be remain\nOn stories from Austin film festival NPR I Will be back in among [noise]\nOh\n\nActors are very conscious especially when they're with other tough guys in the film of that competition who's going to be the biggest onscreen\nAnd so they watch this for a while they said well they're pretty that's pretty pretty fun watching these two guys just sweat it with each other trying to be the biggest talk of the walk and then it evolved into this shot which some people love and some people have some people that gets to medicine takes you out and other people think it's emblematic of the eighties kinda macho movie\nWell I mean it was certainly very eighties movie\n[noise]\nI mean but here's the thing it's for men right I mean ladies aren't turned on by that are they oh my God this is one of my favorite movies ever made those muscle man absolutely you're ... than they are just\nHave to say this cast is pretty great I mean bill\nDo belly landed on tests the sunny poor Sunday yeah he's going now yeah\nUh as as Kevin Peter Hall played the predator the one thing I Want to stress you know I'm I'm probably in many ways although this is fun to show the film I'm I'm not the right person to be talking to us about specifics because\nThis one was fun but it's not mind at all it's it's really the ... the product of Joel and John\nReally John on during the hearing and yeah and they and he's you know he was this young guy at the time with just as head of steam under him he'd be up there playing with this camera you know she does own world and a really amazing to see people fortuitous Lee come together it's sort of first timers trying stuff\nThat could have gone either way and ended up being thirty year iconic and its longevity\nYeah let's talk about ... really quickly I mean he he was great he was great to mitigate us die hard and last action hero that up but [laughter]\nHe clearly had a capacity to make great action movies\nHe was a wonderful stylist the sense that he knew\nHow every shot related to every other shot\nBack then you didn't do extensive prevents you did some story boards and visualization you walk to set you spend as much time on the set as you could and you've you've noticed the way the story telling visually the transitions even from one shot to another very smart man\nTo know what goes with what what's going to cut together and what's not and there's very few glitches where you see like camera moving this way and then it goes the other way where a something doesn't flow smoothly once I get to the next he was very sharp even without story boards at visualizing the\nThe stand Winston part I had an impact on how popular is so became\nSo no sheer fortuitous is yeah wonderful ... stand Winston used to run a creature shop but he was the one\nThe day along with Rick bakers Rob a teen who are kind of the creature guys and stand in a movie for for me and Fred decker called monster squad back then too [noise]\n\nAnd this came out the same year there was this big red puppet there was supposed to be a month we're going to replace it with you know visual effects in this big red you know balloon running around the jungle\nAnd it didn't work uh the original predator was supposed to have these backwards articulated chicken legs and be really tall and walk him crazily like you know and it just wasn't working and John cloud van dam\nPlayed the predator initially yeah he got in a suit and of course you know he was upset because he's just a kind of too many geeks like getting a geek\nAnd it's like er yeah well do you know you're getting paid just do what you know it's just not for me I go back to ...\nSo he took off and we got this other more amenable guy who was just such a sweetheart it didn't work at all so stand came in in two weeks and through this thing together you know as a real last minute last ditch effort\nAnd it became the iconic thing we needed a title\nBecause under wasn't working so it was a a Jesus ... of a predator nah that's not very good well let's let's just use it predator\nAll of a sudden the iconic you know all these things ... here and they've done this one film nobody so called nomads who was John material and knowing all of a sudden wonderful did you finally you know full flowers talents just really sprout\nWell I mean that said that one team or the predators in the tree and he pulled out really I mean you know it's just\nAnd it's the images e chosen the ways that these shot them too I mean it's not a lot of hand held John new to keep everything\nIn perspective those wonderful cut always the long shots of the predator framed unevenly kind of\nBroken framing with him up in the quarter an screaming as he repairs himself those were real\nReal dynamic choices are back when we didn't have the benefit of CGI okay so the elephant on his stages\nWhat about yours I was lucky enough I was privileged enough to be brought in a to try to breathe some life into what had become a franchise that was serviceable but not spectacular\nYou know every few years someone would say here sixty million would put together a predator movie\nA was a guaranteed investment had certain amount of return but they never really him had ambition they never went for anything alien versus predator when I say that I think the event\nAnd they said here's fifty million just you know they they go to a small town in the alien runs around the predator chases and you know they didn't have that sort of grand feel of well let's re imagined let's try to reinvigorate the franchise imagine for a moment that we had some money to work with and we want to invent ties that is\nTo make it feel like the kind of movie that you would open in the summer you want someone to say prejudice come and two weeks from now let's get tickets I don't know if that's going to happen\nBut we try and our best to make a sequel it takes place in the same universe and the references the characters that you just saw\nIt also draws from the second predator movie which started Danny Glover and uh Gary ... Ruben Blades and Gary do see in that movie his son is an R. movie yeah he plays the son of that character so we try to keep a little bit of continuity going that way [laughter]\nOkay I'm going to open up the questions anybody have any questions or I was wondering how\nAre you at the idea in kids kiss bang bang started to do like the take on like lord our narration he did\nWell that's just fine I've always loved narration people say the screen writing classes don't do their ration but I ... some of the best stuff I've ever seen on that really ... it was narrated pieces like Shawshank Redemption one\nStand by me as another um little bits at the end of those both those movies where you just gosh tears when they ... narrators sums it says one key phrase like I think in ... he says\nYou know a long shot at him on the beaches I hoped time has treated my friend well I Hope I Hope he wasn't too afraid I Hope that you know the and the last thing he says I Hope and you realize that he's never done that before\nSo that narration in that little piece there without trying too hard actually caps the entire film\nStory is part of a growing number of programs in Austin film festival sponsoring project including ... radio program in ... and the\nStory the hearing to find out more about on story in Austin film festival dig it on TV what Austin film festival dot com story from Austin film festival NPR I Will be back in a moment\nI'm Tracy show cheered listening to K U T Ninety point five\nI was happy to be in the audience for that the cue in a A N E S and ask a question uh that wasn't\nMe by the way are right there but\nUh [laughter] it was pretty fun as fun to see\nBand or the Austin film festival is coming up just right around the corner kiss you curious\nTexas farmers market is looking for volunteers or their fifth annual Austin fermentation festival taking place on October twenty first this event included workshops fermented food vendors beer wind beverages and live music you can find all the details at Texas farmers market\nDot org support comes from rock and roll rentals keeping Austin in gear for Thirty years two locations on Bernadette ... old too are fat Lamar rock'n'roll rentals dot com\nBoom the mid term elections are approaching and with so much going on in the world including your only world [noise]\n\nIt can be hard to say caught up feeling out of the loop all things considered\nHas the news you need to know and the context you need to stay up to speed to listen to all things considered and say here the bigger picture every afternoon from NPR News\nJoined us at ... pm every week or every day this week for all things considered\nThis is on the story from Austin film festival NPR I\nStarted ... were packed with shame black discussing the original predator and how it's managed to hold off even after Thirty years [noise]\n\nWords to us and we heard and explain as he drove out of sight [laughter]\nWay I see it you're a team you worked in television I give you fifty percent chance of pulling this off\nFor the next ten days we were crazy man there was twenty hour days each um there were psychotic\nEpisodes there were breakdowns there were tears um there there's an incident thank God not caught on video may renting buy clothing and screaming and try\nThat you know I think grey goose in the opening remarks for my career I I oh grey goes a huge thank you for X Men first class but anyway it was it was ten days of writing and rewriting to the point where two days before it was do we got more notes on the first act\nFrom our executive and I flipped out and I called them I said hey man I Love you a minute but uh we got thirty pages we need ... Ninety more by friday\nSo we can go back and ah we can polished the first thirty pages or we can write a script somebody can dream like and if we only have the first thirty pages and we don't get ... will be our fault of yours\nYou said you're right maybe you should write the rest of the script\nSo we did but um it was it was quite an experience getting through that but also it was it was awesome and it was fun and I laugh about it now and\nI've been in therapy for five six years or so [laughter] ...\n... there were movies which lend themselves better to being sequels and here's the inherent problem icy and I've been had to face it which is when\nSome when you make a movie about something that's different from a TV series right because the idea is that what happens to the character in a movie is supposed to be the most important thing that ever happened to him\nThat's why you chose it for this movie you didn't focus on the thing that happened we don't care about you said look one moment in this person's life this amazing thing took place we're going to show you that progression\nThen you finish it and up until about Nineteen eighty or so it was cool to just stop so that was pretty good movie\nLet's let's go see another one a different movie [noise] and then about ... I Believe the first one stop me it was probably French Connection to and at the time remember thinking that's really cheesy because the French Connection was a completely self contained and startling you know seminal piece of film\nThen they made exorcist too and you start to go this is this is this going the wrong way there are other things like cops stories detective stories but you know and you say okay well that's a little more that lends itself slightly better to the concept of they can have another case to work on\nBut even then like lethal weapon we finish that and ah they wanted a sequel almost immediately there's not really a reason to make a sequel unless you can somehow trick yourself and hopefully trick the audience to think that well\nWhen you've done watching the second one\nIt should feel like it was meant to be from when you started the first one like somehow you trick them into thinking yeah it was really one big story the first part was how he deemed himself the second part is how having redeemed himself he realizes he's living on borrowed time that he's been afforded this opportunity which now he must give up so it's like part one part to\nLive on [noise] oh no [noise]\nNot David you're [noise]\nAllowed you\nGot that you're not\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nIt's done in the third and fourth lethal weapons don't need to be made the superhero genre is I think inherently episodic because you have hundreds of issues with these comics but even then you're struggling to find out how these adventures somehow the most important things\nThat define these characters not just an episode where they exercise their muscles and go home so it's it's a tricky business and uh I I've just real quickly I'll say kiss kiss bang bang bombed\nI wanted to do a sequel to that I wanted to\nDo another case and they wouldn't let me because it bombed so I actually wrote not a sequel but I use the exact same style to do a film called the nice guys which is essentially just the sequel I would've made with different characters so that's another way to go to a private investigator goes there's twenty bucks in there I just take it\nYou can afford to live like this is a PIN [laughter] what's the message of\nStuff looking for me [noise]\nMean even looking for nearly a she's a person of interest that\nPut a fork in me don't really put forth from\nWell Shane just to stay with you for a second this you did write play dirty I did a draft where I tried to make it seem like you know this is sort of the stylistic continuation and the most\nLogical the end of the ... diet is it OK didn't give you one movie gave you too but he dies it was a bad bad thing to do writing a sequel I almost had a breakdown I just was so young and scared and try to try to get around the fear\nThat I felt um to me writing is just distracting yourself from your fear by finding a problem that's momentarily more interesting than terror\nAs you look at it but you know just hang in there if these are good you are going to hear horror stories like the Halloween panel but just [laughter]\nSo uh I mean let's talk about some horror stories or I don't know if there were a private Benjamin this is an iconic film\nThe thing about paying attention and like I had so I wrote the ... the valley girl remake the first draft and the second draft I guess and um people like that so then they're like\nShe's the eighties remake girl when a remake patent Benjamin call her you know which is just that classic studio thinking how rebel they'll send it attached with valley girl I thought okay the idea that it it's a musical way using all eighties music\nAnd we put it in a framework of the flashback it starts with I'm Julian Randy today and it's a memory and to me there was a reason to reexamine that story retaliate with with that idea of using using the music I I didn't feel like when we were working I've had with him we ever hit on that\nI Know that we have a variety of folks here who worked in this realm of re boots remakes prequels sequels but I'm just curious as to what responsibility you feel towards the project is it the original material is if the will of the studio and where does your own gut fall into that\nUm I guess for me you know there are projects even offered we've said no to even things that on paper I\nWould love to have done and there are projects he said yes to and I and I think the things we have refused we've refused because we've had nothing to say about them um we felt as though the original film or said something very specific that\nIt's not about improving upon it it's whether we felt there was room for for something else oh\nStory from Austin film festival NPR I Will be back in among [noise]\nThis is Katie Ninety point five I'm Tracey
