I'd known Sam bit\nPrior to working on the getaway we're dead several conversations about ride the high country which is one of my favorite films and uh then I had not seen him for\nA couple of the just socially I met him a couple of times and then I wrote the get away I was hired to write the getaway and Peter by Donald which was going to direct it and then Peter fell out of the movie\nI finished my draft and Sam came into the film after I finished first draft and then uh\nIt didn't really change the the big change was\nThat the first draft was period and the story took place in or is it does in the gym tops a novel in Nineteen forty nine I think it was something like that they decided it was too expensive to make it a period film\nOr they didn't think it was for the that kind of experience or something you know it was one of those so we updated I remember being very worried about it because police technology has changed and even then and I was really worried about a ... wasn't realistic could they could\nAnd I think by the way when you look at film it's kind of a flaw in the films that it feels almost like Nineteen thirties and forties the you know they're worried about radio and\nTelevision or something like that but it's anyway salmon I got along quite well I was great buyer of his I liked him is not a secret that he had to you know shall we say medical problems getting problems with alcohol\nAh I think the get away is not as great as film\nI think it's a good one ah when it came out it was not particularly well regarded but it was a it was an enormous commercial his biggest hit Sam ever at and uh the commercial hit\nOr that it became was what enabled me to become a director so I have\nVery high regard [laughter]\nUh Sam was ah he was easier to talk to in the morning that he was late in the afternoon he can be very funny but he was angry man yeah he had a lot of Bangor uh about studio system she had a lot of anger\nI I don't know what the source of it all was a really wouldn't presumed to say he was he could be very funny he had a shark biting where he was very intelligent I'm\nVery loyal to his friends he was constantly searching\nHere the better the fire may allow myself he had a bit of that kind of paranoia I think that's common among people with alcohol problems he was constantly searching for disloyalty she was there was the [laughter]\nThere was a general test of everybody every so often but um\nI have nothing really but and he was very kind to me later when I became a director and he was he was in his sharp way he was not an easy got to talk to you know it was a somebody said this one I thought it was so actually it was like somehow you were in a movie and except you didn't know that dialogue and he\nDid [laughter]\nAnd so they had a we had a way of\nKeeping you a little bit off base in the conversation you never quite knew of course we're you know I was young screenwriter ah he was the great ... and he was he was great and uh so I was you know you're very deferential and\nSo this kind of off balance called the conversations was probably exaggerated by the relative position the both of us and but he was very good he's a very nice to me very uh we had we had a couple of\nCreative arguments were they were nothing wasn't like him the queen Christ the head McQueen got some bad any me through a magnum of champagne across the room is Sam Sam just ducked ...

E. O. of Roger Clemens and you will pictures of the time who had gone to work at a riot some literally it all started it all started with new or old pictures\nAnd the people who had moved on on\nThe other companies that financed at a higher level I mean given I wanted Rogers to finance it and he said I'm ... you know you guys have learned everything that you can learn here it's time for you to move on and you got to leave the nest and secondly you won't want to see that\nVersion of the movie you'd have to [noise] you'd you'd make for the money that I can give you and he was right\nAnd and so that's another thing is that if you're in a position that responsibility make sure that you have the foresight to know when the people that are working under you it's time for them to move on and uh\nYou know and if you're not the right fit for them that's also an important lesson\nWriter director Scott Frank's credits include little man Tate get Shorty Minority Report Marlene me\n... out of sight and a walk among the tunes does which he also directed his credit was a screenplay for this year's dark action blockbuster Logan and his next project is the upcoming Netflix series God lists\nThe trailer for which we screen prior to this panel at\nThe Austin film festival here Scott Frank discussing character in the movie writing world\nI actually don't think that screenwriters don't think enough about character I think what they think about is attitude and type or worse an actor\nWho might play the role so what makes a person that's what I'm always thinking about what\nSort of specificity of someone's human condition what are they dealing with what are they afraid of and most importantly and I think a lot of writers would say this what do they want to someone wanted should be really simple and they get it at the end or they don't get it at the end in some dramatic\nFashion but maybe you know but what did they want and it was I think it was since he ran when she was way back when she was teaching me how to write [laughter]\nWe were talking about a movie called trip to bountiful which I talked about a lot which is the simplest movie ever Lindsay said do you want to learn how to write a character you should see trip to bountiful and I said the the lady on the bus movie I'm\nAbout an old lady who gets on a bus she wants to go home to her home town that's all she wants and along the way Rebecca Dearborn age sits down next to her and they talk about her life and it it sounded awful to me and I'm watching the movie and at the beginning it's Geraldine Page it's yeah\nYou know says I'm a ... you know where you go I Want to go she's leaving her family who's not very nice to her so she can go to bountiful she says her back in the morning I Want to go to bountiful when I'm sitting there thinking I could really get\nOut the window\nIf something happened and by the end of that movie I'm In tears going\nTo buy food too bad because\n... foot is the master storyteller who made me want which she wants no matter how simple it was and it was one of the most profound lessons I ever had because I realized that that's\nWhat writing is is making you want getting you inside the people you're watching your they're not just doing things because the script said so which is which is we should just digress for ten seconds which is a a ruler ... which is something that happens in movies\nAnd TV to such a degree of makes me nuts and I usually when I talk about this I tend to pick on the show twenty four 'cause it was the one that made me angry is and\n[noise] so um keep her Sutherland to save the world's sixteen times he's always right he's never wrong he goes to his boss and he tells his boss having save the world sixteen times the world's in trouble and the boss says you're fired [laughter]\nWhere the boss says I don't believe you were the bosses you can't I Know you can't do that because of its it's fake conflict it'd be\nA bunch of the we don't have the budget and we're in mind hunters doing this now the their Boston the FBI is just disagreeing with them all the time because this group says so there's no reason if you want the boss to disagree give him a good reason something make him a real character rather than because the script says so and if you have\nSomething happening because the script simply because this group says so that's not a character and you can't get story from that\n[noise] there are these things that I think you do really really well with characters beyond the understanding the fundamental wants the characters and making their wants believable to us but you also make them very specific how intentional is that I Know that there's a danger\nBecause there's on one side of the line is gimmick\nWork ... which I Know neither one of us are big fans of like you know he's a character with one eye and his daughter\nBut on the other side you liked that one but um but on the other side there are those\nInteresting bits idiosyncrasies that do seem to flush things out when you think about those things do you think about them intentionally or do they just sort of emerged naturally as you're going [noise]\nUm yes they do I do think about them I think about them it's always\nLike a low grade fever [laughter] these sorts of things because we're writing is a way of thinking it's a way of thinking and if you do it a lot it's like playing by ear or being able to\nPlay the piano without looking at the keys whatever it is you're always these things are just happening naturally if you can get your brain into a way of thinking it's not about the mechanical things you know that that anybody can learn you know we can I'll write a script that looks like a script but it won't be living breathing story so with character\nWhoever shows up on the page if they have one or two lines\nOr they appear for any reason they're taking a real estate in your story they should matter\nThey should matter they should have a moment they don't have to derail the scene or or wait the scene in the wrong direction but it should be a real person and writing real people is just a matter of being observant\nYou know I just stealing from what I see and then the more I steal the more I learn and the more I learned the more it becomes this low grade fever that's always underneath that I'm always doing whenever I start to write people so that\nWhen I'm writing is a character is flat to me it feels bad taste like chalk right away the character there isn't enough there and I need to go okay well
