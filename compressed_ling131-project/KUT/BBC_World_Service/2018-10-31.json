orientation\nAnd ... you've been listening to at the rabbis tall they are very divided views on whether a president should have attended ... what's your view shitty have come over then I'll say he's come down and says\nWell my personal opinion is you should have waited to the funerals were\nInducted I think that I I think that the families need time to grieve and so I Would prefer him as long along with our mayor if he had stayed away and allow the ... the the the family's degree first before before coming but it causes the device\nAnd his decision isn't ... he has a constitutional role to play yeah he's the elected president of the United states it is his decision to make at the end of the day\nI I guess it is and on one hand in a way it is not I think the goal of any leader\nTo bring healing in unity um I think that his rhetoric has been so hateful and his rhetoric has been so divisive and his presence\nIs counterproductive to healing um our city as well as you're not in our nation and so I think he if he wanted to to do something that was good for our community you would have stayed away\nThat this could encourage him to speak out against anti Semitism and he hasn't actually been hateful to was the American Jewish community I talk so that the leaf that he's hatred against this community is incorrect\nHe's been hateful toward um African Americans toward Hispanics toward\nUm the gay and lesbian community um he um um does not condemn I'm even row races white nationalist ideology in and and so I I think that um when you start\nI'm allowing aid groups to fester um they will attack um people who have they have historically attacks in African American and Jewish Americans have always been at the center of heat movements in this country\nAnd so once you start I'm having that sort of racist hate rhetoric\nYou in um which all of us at risk than I Am an African American I'm a about American descent myself and so I'm acutely aware of the dog whistles\nAre coming

James Menendez since\nI've been speaking to Steven ...\nWho was US ambassador to Yemen from two thousand something between ten and is now the executive vice president of the Arab Gulf states Institute in Washington\nHe joined me I live from a Washington bureau I asked him why he was just taken the step now rather than any other point during this bloody will\nI think there's a lot of external circumstances that have converged at this moment I think the ... shows you the or does have some impact on thinking in Washington certainly in Riyadh\nI think the reputational costs of ... you have any war now to the Saudi regime at a moment of enormous stress is has to be taken into consideration I think the most recent un report\nDiscussing ... a much worse than than situation humanitarian crisis is going to be exacerbated or in coming weeks also has to fact in more thinking as the fact that the U.S Congress has been going in peace in the in patient with our continuing support for the\nThe Saudi coalition and us airstrikes do the sales of of nations and logistical support an ethnic all of these elements land a certain sense of urgency to the ministry which is most welcome as Martin Griffiths said\nBut they're not ... at the moment has great to leverage the crown prince Mohammed bin ... them and previously\nWhile I Would like to think that's true I don't know that's the case but I certainly hope that we do believe we have an opportunity here to demonstrate to Saudi Arabia are continuing support for the government for the regime for the royal family are in exchange for some very careful and thoughtful decisions being made on some of the crises that Saudi can help resolve\n[noise] so how do you see this come like coming to an end I mean the United states or could hold up on supplies to Saudi Arabia for instance\nWe could I'm not sure that would be the the magic bullet that would solve this if you will um I Do think Martin Griffiths plan\nThat she is has outlined for you hear this afternoon is certainly very welcome and I think that's something the United states should and will be supporting and I hope we'll do it\nVery publicly and very energetically because I think that this is going to be one of the final opportunities to put the parties in the same room and have them sit face to face and decide how they get out of this terrible mess to both of them all in principle parties in fact are responsible for creating\nDo see Iran that being prepared to deliver that who seems to the negotiating table\nI'm not certain Iran could if it even more than two I think that the uh the Hutus every happy to take support from Iran and they've been receiving some ... support and some other support from the Iranians but they've never been beholden to run you know as was this something and it was engineered a in Iran either so these will\nAgain they'll make their own calculus on how to benefit themselves in this situation and I think if I'd love to see Iran be helpful and they suggested they can be and I know they're talking to some members of the EU so I Hope those talks will advance the process that Martin gift it's his engineering himself\nBecause even if you do resolve the immediate come play in Yemen are you still have those two regional or Saudi Arabia and Iran ... each other didn't you\nWeigh you certainly do and and that's one of the issues now is that Yemen increasingly becoming a an arena in which Saudi Arabia and Iran can go toe to tell if you will over their rivalry and I think that as\nEnormous consequences\nI'm for you I mean which is clear right in the middle of this and we need to get this over with so that is Saudi Arabia and Iran can decide other ways to to to figure out among themselves between themselves how the region is going to go forward\n[noise] I thought that he referred to end it wrong to be reputational damage perhaps to Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin some man but has that we should be reputational damage to the United states because of its involvement in this conflict\nI think that's a consideration I think that we are now increasingly in publicly associated with the coalition and this behavior in his conduct in the consequences\nOf the way it is ... is is prosecuted this war in Yemen are we are the first supplier of weapons and the sport for the Saudi coalition I think that is something we would like to be able to walk away from we can do that if we can persuade the Saudis and the ... and the others to figure out a way\nTo compromise sufficiently to win the war find out what we can do to make that easier for them to achieve what is it will weaken constructively play that will allow them to make the tough decisions I think that can be our role I Hope that we're going to be doing in the coming weeks\n[noise] but ... says David says shoe was US ambassador to Yemen from two thousand and seven to ... executive\nVice president tell me how ...
