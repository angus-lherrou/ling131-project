black\nIn this case we have Russia who is hiding behind us in vale of deniability it's easy for them to say this wasn't us it was some random hackers or some mercenary groups when the world all knows

come to the real was Asian that cyber attack can be seen as an act\nOf war start retire can be as damaging in some way as a a genetic or physical attack and I think that has to change\nNow as a result

to in this case seven individuals\nAnd not to bring to a grand jury and returned an indictment you need a pretty substantial amount of evidence and\nRemember in the ah two thousand sixteen election

was two weeks later we were called to the sheriff's department the autopsy report look back\nAnd they told us that the medical examiner had vote is a homicide and the death was caused by fixation and that was probably the most dramatic and traumatic moment in all this less ... and he had been killed\nAt the time ... did spoke a debate in the U.S about police interactions with people with disabilities but the deaths keep on coming\n\nFor in Oklahoma City to look into the case of a man who was confronted by police in front of his own home\nAnd police to see if he was carrying a weapon actually it was a piece of steel piping but they shouted instructions\nIn the end of that confrontation the man\nWas shot and killed problem was he never heard the instructions for the police were giving him as one neighbors around was shouting at the police couldn't hear those instructions risk death [noise]\nYou\nAnd in most cases those options out there and they deal with those situations without having to use any force at all\nBut some of those goals as we now know have ended with a disabled person being killed by officers who say they felt threatened but if there is no option and police on to be the first to be cool how can things improve\nAnd so the world is very frustrating to somebody with an intellectual disability\n... took the devastation caused by the death of her son Ethan who had Down syndrome and just trying to turn it into something positive\nTo tell you and you can have my passion and you know that somebody with Down syndrome you are missing out\nToday she's running a training session with officers to teach them how to deal with people with a disability calmly using had terrible personal experience\nEven didn't have the cognitive ability to recognize those officers needed an explanation like oh officer that's okay I'm going to sit here and watch this maybe I Love the second time my mom on her way\nFar reactions of you have from offices when you explain your story officers generally put the head down a little\nThey can try they looked sorry almost every officer seems to take on a lot of the shame\nThe department whose offices were involved in eastern stuff though has not engaged with party they agree to financial settlement with a but never so much as ... or\nAdmitted any wrongdoing their refused on our interview requests but earlier in the program we heard from sergeant Corina ... shot and killed a woman with a mental disability that experience pushed him to take training on the issue\nHe's now one of Oklahoma city's trained

why\nNeeds help with a mental health fishery or [noise]\nOne out of one twenty table respond out there without um Seventy [noise]\nWe arrive at the couple's home on a suburban street in Oklahoma City\nWe might have become inside\nMy name is sergeant in on what the police department\nTheir husband called us about what's going on today\nCome a time of year for specter\nOnce inside the house he finds a woman who appears to be experiencing a manic paranoid episode\nI lay\nOn the computer\nWhen he tries to take her way to a psychiatric facility the situation quickly becomes more heated\nThat I can say okay no that's right you're not consenting [noise]\nDisability or not the vulnerable do sometimes still end up in handcuffs even officers who've had disability training sometimes feel that in protection must come first sergeant knew know knows from the incident where he felt he was forced to kill schizophrenia woman\nA lot of times when you see these shootings you'll see officers that'd be like you know they'll yell at curse words the after it's over there ... there they'll boy some kind of frustration you know\nThat is absolutely is because they know they're they're they're like why why did that happen and why would they not just do what I wanted them to do why would they not reach why didn't they just comply\nBut but you know holding the training now will tell you I'm sure he just hung up says all the time there are situations where people calling for whatever reason [noise] fly\nBut that's the boss or doesn't know that there's no external indication that I'm mentally ill all we see as officers who are responding to an event\nIs a violent threatening behavior that we have to intervene\nThe safety of the officers in the community have to be paramount I have to make sure I go home to my family night\nBut that still sounds like people who call comply for whatever reason could still get home to almost before police can compute that there's a ... absolutely I can [noise]\n\nThat's something we keep coming back to an issue with the way the police are taught to interact from the very beginning with so much emphasis on firearms training and relatively little on the escalating confrontations disability and race advocate Candace Coleman\nSays that's hard to override however much extra teaching police officers get on vulnerable groups\nSolve that training is one thing but it's not enough we need a cultural shift across the board I think that ah the way of only stay approach situations need to change\nAnd always being a media reaction is to pull out you're a gun or your teens or or ... that fast paced timed and I gave you ... situational woods actually\nHave to say I'm poor and having time so that there can be a more thorough assessment of what is going on\nWe want with Candace to sell so Chicago where she grew up and when she works to find out about the effect it's having on the community seeing interact with some of the young people she works with like teacher who has autism\nIt has made Paris fearful of calling the police also may individuals with disabilities themselves fearful of being around police\nOr want to know why is that I'm aware as\nParents are trying to change their case more about police\nOh and then it has gone as far as parents asking a to actually put the curricula how should my kid in Iraq with a police officer is there in front of the\nIowa organizers saw Oregon as a young adults and immediately the plan usually centers around what we do about belief is ...\nHow do we protect ourselves it's not even arrest part that's the worry is the fact that I felt like I Will be bodily harm\nIs extraordinary to talking about groups of people with disabilities having to come up with a plan to or talking through how to defend themselves against the police but that's what I think so yes it is\nSo few hopes of the major shift and please culture we could save the lives of people with disabilities with the escalating situations really is the food comes and even fewer expectations of mental health provision radically improved here\nSome of the most vulnerable in American society are being left to work things out for them so\n\nThat's it for this edition of assignment on a limb of bowls the producers Josephine casually and to hear more from the series go to BBC will service dot com forward slash assignment

...\nGoodman center of the public in a sense being sold a bit of a a green wash us a puppet note that green up through\nI Will disagree or two cups care about that we don't have a clown I mean seriously we have debated a plan in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a deal to the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars to\nA part of the plan of the taxes for cars I mean we haven't Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy\nA car with the fossil fuel is full taxes\nSo for example does is the active policy\nAnd we have to also take into account up this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the word solution you have to shut down the coal plants they are more loosening and making this a problem so now I mean Norwegian gas can be part of the solution\nBecause no region gases clean out but if you think about well no way could do given that it's wealthy what should it to what more can it do I guess I should know way innocence be able to make more choices because of the wealth that enjoys\nWe have to do a lot of the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical buttons that you can do one thing and then it will be solved that's not true because\nThere's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do more renewables you have to replace coal with gas like in the u._k. they could use energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal recalls of Norwegian guess that was disillusioned for them\nAnd of course if not the solution forever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades\nBut we're going in the right direction and we have to go on the path\nThat it's I don't really think we're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policies because we continue with this this is your shoulders to political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and uh\nThe longer we continue with the businesses to show the harder it will need\nTo when I get a wave a magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan will shut the plan B\nWell I think we should start taking part of the national debates about how much more oil and gas that can put into the atmosphere because if they burn all the research they know about now it reaches almost feed the greatest so everyone needs to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for\nThe oil industries to first of all around their company in a way to the benefits\nOf ah the owners which is the states with the north and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for how we can get off\nThat feels so I think there was a division now for the\nFirst time in our fifty years of experience with oil that to the public sector for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north\nSixty percent totally in Norway said that we don't want to open the most vulnerable areas in the north that before in the areas and the they also have pulled showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons ...\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy a debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out into words and look to China for example\nAnd uh the CEO to emissions they don't know any national borders so we have to look on a on a great to skate and I mean that's since the weeds on oil and gas it's one of the most green once produced in the world well enough to come through such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because\nNow specific point that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat the ... islands is very important environmental area and then all of us have no way could be opened up to really important to marine life important but it's not something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very uh special area on the whole Silicon Valley as before so do you think he had a tipping point as far as public opinions consent no I mean it's a it's a nice you know because we have\nA a political ... from other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... than the region hydro power than the region hydropower is one tenth the geo walked we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nCarry this because he is not to view that shed by much of the Norwegian public that actually ... does this we do it well it's not safe bleeding when the power comes from no way we take it out to the news from the ground and where the good guys and all\nOf this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of self says that climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on ... ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy that's holding you transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the ... happening in Germany and that's going to change the marsh gets to which we sell our petroleum ethanol though as far as you\nCan sense shut the new ... new exploration licenses for and in places like the parents see in the ...\nThe judge

gas which is an industry body and the request office and associate professor and political junkie ... at the University of Trump say thank you all for joining us we talked about noise oil wealth and to some extent well that money is going on that this is a rich country\nIn this house I want to think more clearly about the plan which you've alluded to is always going to abandon selling fossil fuels is serious about climate change and how it might do that\nNow the government's commission to legally binding emissions reduction targets the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by age to Ninety five percent of Nineteen Ninety levels\nAnd at the same time\nHoff the value of this country's exports of goods come from oil and gas I often like Elvis tuned who's noise environment minister

that are doing just transportation sector I mean are sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month and was a close to fifty percent of the folks without the same time you know the oil and

towards Germany ... England so let's we'd become part of it if our resources are large enough\nTo become the ... for Europe I think that is most us realistic only this summer they had the drought we'll be old from needed to import electricity from all become 'cause this is really connect to the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which no way has written if you like to who says you've convinced public opinion that is is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are in the ... ... for the world to reach the Paris Agreement goals we how can make major change who's the next four eight twelve years so we really have to compromise the U.S marshals society has become a false us we can\nBut it won't really see that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emotions but it's also a strategy for a social change economic change is multiple their moral question is really about the hard policy so how do we deal with climate change of the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness\nIn the future that the environment is to not Elvis too and\nHe's in a hurry can fly on you\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to talk to her at the same time I don't think it's ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not drop out of all them\nVery interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw this site where this cable there's got to go it stops and filled all in the southwest it goes all the way to the northeast of England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this in a sense ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneer and getting away from some of the criticisms that you've level\nAbout his role as a fossil fuel producer insider\nMay be I think it's really good for us that we are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually develop more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much here as you can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we have been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen that oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that we have to think about the way the use energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that actually if you want to be part of the Europeans illusion than actually making more renewable energy can be one of the answers to where we could put our money and that ...\nGay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power people are worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas ... they're worried that the ... they're going to pay to go up which suggests that\nPeople had no way are just as worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to say well\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to\nUse your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline that has given us a lot of energy and different forums over a lot of years\nAnd that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in the way we have a lot of discussions about wouldn't move parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there\nSo it's not that easy to just shift and there's also another concern that's huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way that discussion above your work about where you live you go to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outsider called ... which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working with local uh energy company or or the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we don't have to put another long cable to supply the but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in that situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures there\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable insecure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should ... certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that to be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for any technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security as of supply will come from renewable notes to develop new pipelines with gas\nBut it's very difficult in today if you want to stop the oil and gas and all the late afternoon or by because they had opened crisis they had like all these things going on\nIn a Senate race which made us able to set all the premises for our oil developments so they can't really model that and that also challenges Norway now to be sort of the new norm ...\nSo if we said if we listen to the economists to say that if you actually bring down supply you bring down the mountain for ... fields and that this is\nA responsibility for a full time feels producers to think about than I think uh we could actually kind of lead the way and thinking about how adjust transition could take place and manage decline\nGame should anybody lived to no way for lessons 'cause it's a problem as we said that doesn't respect boulders\nI think that the main lesson from Norway is a historical left because it is the lesson above the national resources are\nThe societies ownership we we own the natural resources together so that tells us up to Walter ... hydropower oil and gas fish whatever is it's a common property and that is what you made it possible and we'll make\nIt possible for us to evolve into the future with offshore mining would off water\nOffshore wind or whatever so the natural resources are common property that\nIs the main lesson to learn so then I think we will have a lot of people working in this sector for a lot of years and I'm Glad the birds institution not only educate people to work and renewables but also educate them to work in oil and gas because we need them in a lot of years ago\nSo let's think about that time scale we have touched on timescales a bit in a sense of rock pop if you're thinking ten years ahead how much dependence do you think that will be in Norway's economy either directly through selling oil and gas or indirectly job's education whatever\nOn oil and gas where where do you think Norway will be in ten years time Kent\nIn ten years time well I don't think it will be a major\nDifference in how we we run society still forty fifty percent of your ... in in ten years so I'm you know I think the perspective has to be more like twenty Thirty years ... probably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nThe Grinch shift is coming I think then technology will have developed so much that it will be\nGoing in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so a bit of ... about the role it technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy tiny as\nWell I think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think if we're going to happen by itself that\nPeople even though the projections that it will keep going until at least twenty she will be some some increase\nThat's not the protections I Would say if you look at the expected production of oil and gas Norway\nIs that it's tilted should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that\nWhen I think that ... has probably reach the peace now and then get gas for the ... the yeah the one and expect that that wouldn't be more gas resources to be found so\nI mean the question here would be should we asked and we shouldn't politicians allow for the also the patrolling the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but that that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you if that's what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the\n... the oil price sell so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think that ... into new which since the site it became more how vulnerable we are to a dollar industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think that we shouldn't\n... do you believe that our guests in the industry will be there for quite some time but it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry is as well and\nWe should try to find new ways of living that would also help the will to find solutions to the climate the to the climate problem there is a ... a crisis could\nBe the answer then yeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our lives it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera\nBut they haven't really realize the effects of climate change so more often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually plan for it\nBut we can't really hold for a climate crisis for Norway to uh to react\nGay a pot smells the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which Norway can citizens dependency on on oil and gas is how\nHow we we we have to remember the last Eighteen years we we reached peak oil in two thousand or so we have ... production of oil from the last eight years\nSo we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and with the predictions I see I come see the the one that this shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me give it time and change with a new wave rolled in that particular debate but\nAlso started up where you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can't use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry scares right you've you've lost this debate well\nWell we all lost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle\nClimate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift the economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here and that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because to me is the trolling resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is not a lot so hopeful ah for the oil industry in terms of economics at guide I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role can she wants to come and\nYeah I mean of course there will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy so\nThat we have to look at that question as well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good here yeah I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and and the long term as well and it will be necessary to me that range\nNotion loss of a agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank you to ... ... ... ... and

is that they're a financially motivated nation state backed group so another way to say it is they're actually banks saves that operate with the expertise of an espionage campaign\nOf how do they get inside the bank networks\nThey use and implement espionage techniques and have a dwell time of an average of a hundred and fifty five days and we've seen them staying in environment for up to two

an Damon in London with wild up dates is it right to say the relationship between Russia and the west is a new Cold War will debate that in the moment\nFirst according to Republicans on the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate the rapidly conducted additional FBI check on Donald Trump's nominee for the ... seat on the Supreme Court exonerate Brett Kavanaugh the leading Democrat on the committee Dianne Feinstein insists the investigation was to superficial\nThe White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record I Know that and ensure that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available\nFor the Senate for the public and the hearing it now appears that they also blocked the FBI from doing its job\nAnd White House spokesman Raj Shah says that's enough for the nomination should be confirmed\nThe fact that these allegations have not been ... by the seventh ... not in a new FBI investigation not anywhere\nThat's Russia of course that's Mitch McConnell a leading Republican\n... we can do to Celeste Headley whose the rights of journalists in radio presenter in the U.S and those so senators from her spokespeople a thanks for being with us I wasn't necessarily ask you to guess how this is going to go I think we can\nSort of assume that it's likely to go ahead I I wanted in the time that we have available ready to ask you how this has affected attitudes to women the me too movement\n[noise] well I mean there's a lot of anger on the part of women who are already part of the me too movement interestingly enough Dan I'm a recent polls have shown that it's actually motivated conservative voters more than it has voters on the left\nAnd that means then the when the November elections come which is what just less than a month away now yeah how might not affect voting\n[noise] it it's a really good question I mean already ... it looks like the young voters are not likely to get out in numbers we have some polls recently that show\nPeople over sixty five are eighty two percent of them are likely to vote whereas somewhere around in the low twenties percentage of young people are probably going to vote and that's like within the past few days so I'm not sure that we might see a huge bump that many people are are expecting\nUm it may turn out as it has in the past where it's mostly senior citizens who knows um but at its early days it showed that conservative voters might be gaining in in what they call in to see as an edge for voting\nAnd the Kavanaugh hearing that's affected that than in a way that perhaps the Democrats haven't expected\n[noise] yeah and and I yeah I mean I Want to be clear that that doesn't necessarily mean that what I just said it is what's going to be reflected on and on voting day November right I mean these are always about who's likely to vote\n'em and and the sample size and so who knows especially if the vote goes ahead and Kavanaugh's confirmed we don't really know that how that's going to affect people and and how angry many women may become I mean we do know that there's there's a wide uh dissatisfaction with the Republican Party among women in\nThere has been some who've said that the Republicans may have lost women for a generation we'll see if that's true\nIt's a nice thank you Celeste Headley giving up before us in the United states thanks very

Olympic athletes that's according to a detailed indictment from the U.S Justice Department\nAnd the Dutch government yesterday revealed details of a failed attempt by Russian agents to undermine the OPEC W the chemical weapons agency based in the have one that was investigating the use of nova joke in the English city of ...\nSo with that in mind what kind of relationship between the U.S between the west and the Russians what kind of a relationship\nIs that now is a new Cold War I've been speaking to an apple bottom who's a historian and commentator and the British member of parliament bumps ... he was a journalist in the Soviet Union when it existed I began by asking and does she react well badly to the phrase new Cold War\nI she dislike the phrase because that leads people to roll their eyes and say oh no not that again we've that's over I Do think it's correct to say that we are living in a time when we are facing once again an ideological challenge to the idea of the west and the challenge is coming in part from Russia which\nCertainly sees itself\nAs at war with us in the very broad sense Russian public is fed with the daily diet of anger and hatred about the west in western institutions the Russian government invests in anti western anti EU anti NATO political parties all over Europe\nThey see themselves as in an ideological struggle so in that sense I think the phrase is although unfortunate is correct\nAbove CD you were in the Soviet Union now you are a part of Britain's political C ... is Cold War and accurate print\nIt because it's clearly not anything like that the Russians coach from it says in eastern Germany much weaker but it is in the dictionary definition of total ... which is a core values and interests paid for that information on it\nAnd they may not have troops in eastern Germany but they have lost number of troops just over the border from a studio for example I'm they carry out loud scale maneuvers along the border of the European Union and NATO could tone hot\nObviously I don't know the answer to that it's certainly true that Russia is using its military exercises almost as a weapon in the information war So Russia has carried out very very aggressive\nExercises up to and including practicing the use of nuclear weapons\nThe point of doing that is to intimidate countries on its borders\nTo show this kind of aggression therefore to weaken support for NATO and some of those countries I think what Russia would really like to do is when the war when the ideological ... without fighting but I don't think we can exclude the possibility Sunday they will use weapons and the Russian Army famous for that it does with an exercise as\nBob Said he will not in that ideological contest that mocked the fifties sixties and seventies between the Soviet Union and the west what could be done what should governments like the u._k. government will the u._s. do in order to calm things down\nI think we're starting to ... this is Richard ... communism versus liberal society\nWhich is a form of Russian ... some of the great ... extra thirty is so far we in the west side of the research is from the very sophisticated all ... states developing means of state control which is on conventional controlled people\nBut also to aggressively sauce with China or Russia or whether it's for the positive future\nMaybe I was wrong maybe it is a high beyond logical all of those people who wants to be\nFor life you know or Italian regimes versus those who don't\nDepends what you mean by ideological but I mean I think certainly we are in a war of values or war is the wrong expression there is a struggle for values which values are going to dominate Europe over the next uh in the coming decades there are now parties who are part of the ruling coalition in Italy as there are for example in Austria\nWho also have very close links to Russia and who admire an advocate the Russian model of of politics corrupt crony capitalism authoritarian rule one man rule one party rule there is certainly a struggle of ideas\nAnd Bob city can then the west can NATO can Britain afford this contest because it seems that robust ... might be the way to resist\nThem is one way or don't necessarily the structure is much richer richer districts that democratic gets ... we can housing for registrations per se come to represent\nBut then again when they think are the pressure came over and it was still in the very early stages of the way the answer you know just two years after Garrett making them are came here the first time we went there\nIn a thinking that oh the experience of other places would be enough and that is right but it's just it's a different game really and I fell on my on my first wave a really big way my biggest slave until that time and I broke my feeble er and um I had a lot of weight on my head\nAnd I had one really big wave hit me after the one I found out and that was a huge impact that took out my life jacket and helped me on the water for two waves and then\nI was further to the inside and I had smaller wave hit me but by then I'll agree ready to diet and I had no no life jacket and I had a broken leg so it was just a struggle rated to reconnect with my driver who didn't find me for around nine minutes so it was a big fight\nAnd into recovery you just decided I'm going to keep going I mean that takes a lot of motivation how'd you kind of give yourself back up to get back out\nProcess denotes ideas I mean I have many injuries that we find surgeries and\nI had I had you know half of my mind in it um by being here and being exposed to the sport and expose the waves and so I tried to be president even though I wasn't fully but for me in order to to keep that fire burning that desire and the focus for so many years\nSo surfers at your level mile will only go out into waves of this size once you kind of dialed in the geography of the sea floor whether it's the north shore of a wall who or people into Haiti knowing how\nThe sea floor shapes the way it was crucial to knowing how it breaks them understanding the power behind that water can you help us understand the geography of the sea floor and also right because these are massive ways maybe the biggest waves in the world\nUm it's a very special place because we have a canyon uh that's approximately it\nThey say up to five kilometers eight we don't really know because it's only measured up to two hundred meters on the charts super close it was late and you know the\nPentagon version is pretty powerful has a really strong went there and we get those big from coming from New York or upper above going to Ireland and coming down to us it has a phenomenon that I it's even hard to understand but I Know that they come in different angles and I think like at times\nIs just to waive combine that became one and they just get really really tall\nWhenever I see the videos from those of read my stomach just drops I Can't believe people even doing that so tell me about your day getting the sixty eight foot wave\n... we're we're we're having a pre spectacular season or really cold winter and a lot of big days we went\nOut that money I mean it was still dark we knew that I was going to be really gigantic because of the forecasts but also because it did get gigantic the night before and we saw it ready for a dog and we we actually waited for three hours and a half or that wave\nSuper code uh was quite tiring and all like for my mind and and my body to keep warming up and focused and sharp and believing that the way it was going to come and not many ways are written that day because it was so big and and difficult\nSo when that wave came we were basically waiting way far out nobody was around us and it came for us then we just decided to go for the second one to be safer and and to have a similar to ride and I\nThought I saw it and I knew I knew was going to be really big so I just started focusing on the renewed completing that ride\n'em as you said you worked really hard for this uh and yet you were awarded this Ghost World record this Monday so many months later tell me more about the whole process and what what took so long\nWell you know there was a difficult in the process um if you understand that there there was no division for the woman and the\nRepairing the oncoming New Haven\nWas considered to be just one record and and obviously it was it was the men's record because you know they were\nChirping bigger than us so it was\nIt was hard to get to get a woman [laughter]\nUm they just wave written a record in the in his book\nWhy and how you know it's a new cut to agree any people to really care for it and really commit\nTo it and I think if there is not one athlete that really pushes started this I mean nobody is just gonna sit there and be like yeah let's just at the woman's\nHere you know just not how it works you know women have to fight\nTo get their space where it's supposed to be just a man's world you know so he's screaming loud enough and you get heard 'em and people here you and that's what happened you know in the end though it's taking so long I didn't know what to do anymore and I started a petition\nA lot of people went out and find it and gave me a thumbs up support than that\nI think what radio rushed the whole process to happen this year\nOne thing I like to hear from our guest on our on our shows what music they listen to and I know surfers off and have a tune in their head of the paddle out or some show music to wind down after a big way such and what are you listening to lately my\nOh my God somebody saying them I Love the new everything is love from the cartoon\nJay Z beyond say um what else to listening to card and be like hip hop\nOr in the ... one last\nQuestion um and you probably did us a lot why do you surf and why do you sort of big was\nSerious 'cause I mean it it's a wonderful sport you know you got in the in the water and connection with the nature and no way the same as yeah there's always that friend Thomas challenging\nThere's so many variables um I don't know I just love the lifestyle and for ... you know in particular is just such a big challenge I've always been moved towards challenging things and difficult things and I I'm\nAlways thought that they wave surfing was the hardest thing you can you could do and surfing and and I think that's one of the reasons I got drawn into it\nBy a Barrow who is now the Guinness Book record holder for surfing the biggest way by a woman it's
