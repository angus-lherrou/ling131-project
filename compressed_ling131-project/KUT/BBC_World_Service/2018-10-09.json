collective health\nI see the urgency of fixing our healthcare system and every patient that I treat and I recognized like many of us that work in health care I've been part of the problem\nI've ordered a twelve hundred dollar bag and failing to save a patient's life knowing that it cost\n... little a dollar or two\nI Know that have created financial distress for my patient and he'd been set to collections and that bill has my name on it and I'm not proud of that\nI Know I've contributed to the profits of companies that have manipulated our governments and our markets\nWe simply can't afford a theoretical debate about who can fix health care and needs to be a conversation about who can actually say that\nI remember as a kid I was rescued from the water I like to go out over my head sometime in the third and a lifeguard through mayor ... devices that hang on to this thing like if your mother and he pulled me to shore he didn't pay for my college education for my high school education or food or anything like that\nMy family and the government did\nAnd that's what it means to have something to pull it out of the turbulence\nAnd put it on dry land\nWe're faced with a health care system that needs to say that I have not heard my opponents make a single argument about how government can save our health care system not a single one we've made several arguments about a retail and save our system\nAnd how employers working directly to take this system from a world of your contract negotiation dark smoke filled rooms and clear out the smoke and turn on the lights and turn this into a transparent system where we know what we pay for and we pay for value so let's turn on the life and clear to smoke\nClosing statement against the motion Rosemarie day founder and CEO day health strategies\nGreat cat Irene I have elderly as I'd like to meet ... she's someone I actually met when we were implementing health reform in Massachusetts She was a fifty year old woman a single parent who had worked hard as a cleaning woman her whole life she had no health insurance\nAnd she was struggling to put her two sons through college she was a very proud woman\nBut she wasn't proud of her fainting spells which would happen at work and sometimes keep her from working and these cells had gone on diagnosed obviously because she didn't have a way to get to a doctor even though she was working she wasn't part of any retailers picture and she wasn't part of any employer alliance\nBut she was finally able to buy some affordable coverage once we launched the health connector and she was able to see a doctor and get diagnosed it turned out she had epilepsy and it was treatable when she came to tell her story at our board meeting she held up the bag of pills which she was now able to buy\nThrough the retailer and that was what was keeping her healthy and productively employed on every front she was doing the right thing and we were supporting her and that\nShe was so happy to report on top of that that now she was going to be able to do the work at to to put her son through college I see this is a huge success story and it's an example\nOf where government insurers and retail all came together to address those big things that are the ultimate measures of our system cost quality and access are we providing that as a society\nWhy wouldn't we want to have twenty eight million more elderly is is I think we can do that if we have the well we talk about Washington is kind of this thing over there I Want to say that's us and\nWe have to actually harness the collective will to demand that of our system because if we have that\nWe can address and drive change we can do that in conjunction with retailers but it needs to come from the polish\nThank you Rosemarie day and I can\nThem on the resolution retail alliances\nNot Washington will save the U.S health care system [noise]\nSo I went to an ounce\nOur results it's the difference between the two votes that determines who are winter is here are the results before in the preliminary vote thirty percent agreed with the resolution thirty six percent were against\nThirty four percent undecided that's pretty much a three way split again those are the first results it's the difference between that result and when I'm about to announce that determines our winter the second vote\nThe team arguing for went up to forty nine percent they pulled up Nineteen percentage points which is the number to beat the team arguing against the motion their first for thirty six percent their second

couples so here's a question which same sex marriages are more likely to end in divorce those between men all those between women\nAnd this isn't just the u._k. the same pattern shown in Belgium the Netherlands Norway Sweden everywhere whether a statistics on same sex divorce it's the same sex during the ... the divorce thing\nThis latest one but what was going on but who could help us with such a question the ... of course is I was always an economist\nWe spoke to dump to marina out shade the Vancouver School of economics in Canada\n[noise] she's the author of dirty money a book which applies economic counties to the study of sex and love and she's been digging into the data for us to try to find a few reasons why it's more likely that women will divorced women and men will divorced men\nOne of the things that we do know about the opposite sex relationships is that women are significantly more likely to be the ones who initiated the divorce so that you might think well there's two women and their relationship thing you're twice as likely to get somebody who wants out of the relationship if that's true that's one possible explanation for this story\nOkay so what other explanations you have\nThe second thing that you think about is is how long people have been in a relationship so there's a joke that you might have heard about which is what does a lesbian and bring to a second state\nAnd the answer is and you're moving van with all of her possessions [noise] this is a stereotype the evidence is anecdotal but we can't say one way or another if this is a case just because the data doesn't exist there's\nAlways that W type is true if we don't have the evidence than the idea would be lesbian relationships move more quickly and then they get married earlier and then maybe didn't they realize they made a mistake\nThey are absolutely so they're they're not spending as much time getting to know each other before they get married there or not ... for several years for example before they get married they are getting married really quickly somebody actually just told me yesterday that they went to a wedding last weekend with two women who only met each other\nIn August so we were\nAllowed to use a on a boat so more or less but if it is um maybe that would be reflected they when they ... we might have forgotten about the age of the people going into a relationship\nYeah no this is actually something that's very interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually being able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorce is a predictor or a divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down in in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent or over the age of thirty five\nCompared to fifty two percent of men so women are marrying much younger than the men and so that could be one of the reasons why we see female same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates than now same sex relationships\nI mean that makes sense I suppose it then poses the foreign question as to why there is an age difference but we probably going to be speculation about that anything else\nWell this is not a thing is that we know that people who may or may first second third maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time\nAnd that's another thing that we can actually see in the in the data that we've been provided so among the women who are in same sex relationships thirty seven percent of them have already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know it's a game that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nAs a researcher looked into this and related questions or what do you need now to go deep or is it more detail and the dates that the officer national statistics already have or is it different kinds of questions or is it just that you you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these divorces wanted to be happening ... three\nTime will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne of the possibility is as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among the people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the capital's\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new given that divorces\nEven newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the matter waiting a little bit longer they separated we don't know if they've separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relationship breaks out but she would notice every relationship very aware of serving the finding of paperwork and maybe men just ignored for work\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nUnder the sheets Christmas parties put you researched relationships and how they work and how they work so I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been off for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep that relationship going what would you said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all the stats on this because you know I see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't laugh at nine your age gap\nIs almost certain divorce statistically right not knowing each other very law these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually tried not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people do\nIn the corner of the the wedding who instead\n[laughter]\nThe age what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences\nBecause women and same sex relationships do have a larger age differences and people who are in opposite sex relationships but this is actually work for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences\nThan people in in opposite sex relationships so\nThe big age difference could have been a factor why we see same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than opposite sex relationships\nBut that's not the case for may comparing women and men in same sex relationship\nEconomists don't to marina ...\nIs all we have time for this week but please keep your questions your comments on Joe speculative theories coming in

with us now the Russians have denied similar claims are made in the past how sure can we be about banning cats claims\nWell until we can really dig down into the actual corroborating evidence to be a little bit so far been and cut it proved to have a pretty good record and given that we we can be pretty set and these were in fact Russian operatives on balance with the usual academic cautions this looks pretty solid\nAnd so what they have identified is that ... is actually an exemplar Michigan he's a doctor what more do we know about him and ... and generally about\nHis identity [noise] well that's nice interesting career track because it looks like precisely he he was a army train don't to who then moved into the gym and all you know the tree intelligence and has then been some

us\nIt's coming up five minutes yeah this is new say hello legalization of kind of it's just very big story it'd be something in the U.S state by state the trade is moving out of the shadows in discussion\nAs often dominated by entrenched positions which is why it's interesting to hear from Neil Polack\nHe's popped dad big ... big defender of the wheat didn't stop him working as a writer of being a good that he was just appalled that\nTotally he's found that decades of smoking I'd actually made him a ... addict so of course he's in favor of ... these very keen to add a health warning at a time that it's going to legal he's had to give it up and he's written about this on ready for the New York times lots of interest on mine is a bit of Neal's story\nI had a um a public melt down wall was high\nAnd it happened in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium which is a baseball stadium and I was actually attending the world series in Los Angeles and I I purchased a ticket\nOnline uh and it turned out to be from a fraudulent third party seller and and now it's this on Facebook and I got a message from some random guy but never met before is that I live near the stadium when you combine my house and we can look up because I was a very you know public stoner and everyone wanted that wanted to get high with me right so\nI went and I spoke to read and then I have this joint that I bought at a store and it has crystallized G. H. G. in on the outside of it was kind of like smoking marijuana burning the crack so by the time I got to the stadium I was blasted absolutely gone I was just scored\nIt away from the stadium by security and I went into the parking lot and I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror of a car\nAnd I didn't like what I saw that yeah that's interesting people like you who have always defended marijuana and kind of say it's largely homeless you still believe it should be legalized and yet he was writing an article about how harmful it can be that it's sort of seems like a contradiction in your attitudes Neal is fascinating\nWell not really I mean if you think about it marijuana being illegal has hurt millions of lives people have been unjustly imprisoned or selling it for possessing yet it's often used as an excuse by police to arrest people on flimsy projects and it's all it's often used\nBy forces not for good and it's also um there's also the fact\nThat it has salutary medical applications right I mean you know I I met children who have intractable\nEpilepsy and the only thing that's been able to cure them in or math or does the THC that veterans with post traumatic stress disorder can only is there headaches going that'll come down there headaches as marijuana you know and there's many other examples of people in extreme pain from cancer\nTaking massive does the THC instead of or CBD instead of um\nOpioids a bat said I'm not any of those people write I'm a I'm you know race\nI without any particular health problems but I Do have an addictive personality and marijuana can lead to mental health problems\nPeople are more likely to listen to ... because of what you've deed is kind of you got the bow to find these people are going to listen to you won't simply would be the message each each legal enjoy it but I Want\nIt legal enjoy it but be careful if you find that it is affecting your relationship if it's affecting your work if your entire life becomes about obtaining yet and using it and hanging out with people who were obtaining it and using it then you might have a problem\nYou got to listen to that if he's ... died on ... another thing that Neal said which is very interesting was that he said them it's no coincidence alcoholics and none of us he said was founded\nOff to the lifting of prohibition or so Americans was allowed to drink than they were allowed to drink than in most of them how to drink problem and he thinks that the same thing is happening now in America at the moment and\nJust as all of a sudden there was a great slew of Nineteen thirties novels about the perils drink and how it affected people he reckons there's going to be a whole load of films and movies and TV and or writing or about the perils of posts a

the mistake of sound of one of the early ... columns of who the jazz trumpeter Miles Davis playing on one of his earliest opens the both of the coup\nSo how did the concept of coup in jazz relate to them they should use of the word in Nineteen fifties American cinema\nAnd did the poetry improves the beat generation and we'll recently well just the words and the idea come to me today I'll be joined by a cultural historian an expert on twenty century cinema I'm sill new law and courage and writer who was exclude the role of coup in fashion so to join us for the forum off to the news [noise]\nWell yes uh except that all of our modern usage use of cool come out of African American jets culture and the Nineteen forties\nSo for anyone to say cool meaning I agree I like that or to call something a cool guitar or cool song meaning it's innovative an edgy and it's a static we knew or they\nAppreciated or for it to have anything to do with style or attitude as opposed to ... each one of those terms comes out of the ways in which jazz musicians used it\nIn the Nineteen forties coming out of a broader usage among African Americans in the Nineteen thirties none of those have any history within the English language of the British use it or in spread so tour which was the Italian equivalent\nOr Spanish to one day and all of those sets of cool actually come from an aristocratic department in which people who are privileged entitled are allowed to be cool and nonchalant to be corn nonchalant when you're someone who is working class or trying to carving out a space for yourself\nIs very different and especially when it comes out of African Americans who actually have no quality at that time\nOkay so let's look more at this ... to cool that you were talking about Joe\n... some historians see it as a kind of a static that comes originally from West Africa can you tell us about\nThat [noise] yes historian Robert Ferris Thompson rights at a particular form of cool called each to to has a long history and the African you're about culture\nTo meant that a person had dignity a calm demeanor grace under pressure and emotional restraint\nIt to to have a spiritual dimension that involved self discipline alertness and an improvisational spirit it gave him meaning to life\nSo uh how did this idea of who identified in this concept from Nigeria country associated with the new world in the United states in particular what's the link\nTo to stop it was used by Africans forced into slavery and the United states as a survival mechanism to retain their personal integrity against humiliation and violence slaves expressed subtle defiance against slave owners\nWho's brutality was met with detached self control\nThat one of my mom's oh\n[noise]\nI don't want them\nIn the plantations and coffee fields with the American south slaves not shut the music which developed into what today we called the blues song half my blind lemon justice and from the blues came jobs which flourished in America cities I'm a centered on Harlem I mainly African American district of Manhattan in New York City\nCouncil I wondered if you could paint a picture for is Nineteen touches Harlem and the jazz scene because this was a hotbed of African American intellectuals and cool style listen to it yes it\nWas and I'm Harlem became this mecca for African Americans what was known as the great migration that take place from the south to the north where a lot of African Americans were fleeing racism segregation lynchings were hoping for a ... chip\nMusic film electric chair guns photography all become to flourish and for me such ... such as James van disease port trait of a couple and I'm\nSimilar looking raccoon for coats and sitting with the Cadillac call it ... this idea of the black drama that came to symbolize an aspect to haul them at that time\nMy daughter ... says loved the giants and the big band music but as long as it can fool them to their expectations but John it's right isn't it that there were different performance styles around in the Nineteen twenties and\nIt's and it's important to understand how they just said you know to to appreciate how the concept of cool developed so tiny briefly citizen\nSo in the Nineteen thirties the front man of a big band like Duke Ellington are kept how he had to be sort of a dandy an aristocratic person because that's what white Americans expected this is a highly racist period\nSo there had to be a certain amount of what you cater to the audience is a compromise to playing and creating the kind of artistic music you want it to create\nThere was something cool to me was that can you explain not\nSo the mass of cool is in immediate direct reaction to uncle Tommy pretty much all African Americans had an Uncle Tom in public in front of white people which means they have to smile and and tougher and pretend\nThey they knew their place if not they were often actually treated violently by the police by anybody\nAnd so the main jazz musician who Uncle Tom public was Louis Armstrong as great a musician as he was he had come out of the deep south and that's what he has learned\nIs that that's how you survive\nReal moonshine in [noise]\nPong the ribs with no\nVotes of burning\nOn solving low\nAnd cool was a math that said we are not going to smile or differ or laugh anymore where artists\nWhen musicians we're human beings and we will not allow white Americans to define who we are\nAnd into the environment will socks off in schools Lester Young who Joe you believed defined coup in one of its on these forms in American culture right well Lester Young took the word\nCool that was then heard in the African American community and he's the first person to use cool as a state of mind as a philosophy as an a static\nWhen Lester Young said I'm cool he meant I Am here in my own style in this environment um and I'm relaxed which is not something that most\nBlack Americans could feel anywhere in the Nineteen forties ... can you just give us an idea of young ... style\nSo Lester Young was cool what that means at the time was he invented several different strategies we still associate with cool and they were all at first to defy racism and protect him\nSo one was not only did he speak in a jazz slang you also had very personal jazz slang such that\nIt was impenetrable it was a code second of all she wore sunglasses at night and on stage and sunglasses shades are in fact probably the single object most associated with cool if you actually tax the word cool what comes up as an icon with sunglasses on\nSo sunglasses provide a sense of mystery that's why they work that way but she ... them at night\nAnd onstage as a way of keeping white people at arm's length\nAnd Soviet shade see a flag walked in a very relaxed matter but most of all Lester Young saxophone style was cool it was an urbane romanticism that was both elegant and expressive and arithmetic and it was one of the most distinctive artistic styles of the ... century\nHe's a brief Lester Young himself speaking in Nineteen fifty nine about the way African Americans with stereotyped\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nSocks off in his Lester Young speaking not long before he died on a recording that features and\nThe forthcoming film president of beauty direction by Henry fettuccine so we've had that Lester Young embrace cool and influence other jazz musicians including the next generation people like the Trump is a Miles Davis his music career had at the beginning of the ground\nCarol can you briefly remind us who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\n[noise] well Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how he changed jazz music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even how to so much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he tons of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style and this meant um jackets and yes Chuck kitchen tonight and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on university campuses\nIn the United states where it's bound to play so there's an um an album called the museums of miles and he's on the

I'm Still studies expert Claudia spring I didn't undone by Russia and ... ...\nWe discussed how cool image originally among African American musicians\nAs fast as a sort of mosques and then a conduit to finance and that seems to be in a rebellious stunts coming through around the same time in white popular culture but at some point in the Nineteen fifties the crossover when a group of rice has known as the beat generation stalls you to appropriate the African American experience Joe citizen\nI don't quite think it was appropriation and the way we think about that and and in terms of the word cool\nIt's just that the beat generation writers word jazz fans all them and jazz was the dominant subculture of New York in the forties and fifties\nAnd so they were jazz clubs all the time and particular Jack Kerouac rights on the road and is the best known of the beat generation writers was a huge jazz fan on facts he calls himself a jazz poet\nOr in his book Mexico City blues so what's really interesting about this period is they they take this new term cool that they hear a jazz clubs in among African Americans\nAnd they're fascinating incest with it\nAnd so in that period a coward writes a letter to his friend you'll pass it in Nineteen fifty says I'm obsessed with cool to the point of a theory\nAnd he goes on to talk about his own obsession with the term so jazz is the first art form which cool expresses itself along with Bill Maher and the writers of the ... generation\nUnderstand that they are looking at a very new definition of artistic expression and improvisation and that what they're going to take as their method and so the reason I say it's not quite appropriation is it's an artistic method and then they say well how would that work and literature\nAnd so ... actually calls his writing style bop property which means bebop prose which means jazz writing and so to that effect it's an artistic transfer more than it is a racial or a sort of effect\nThing the unfortunate part of it is that correct did not represent African Americans as well and literature as he did understand jazz as amusing\nLet's have a short extract from Jack Kerouac famous novel on the

conformity gained currency thanks to an essay by the influential American writer Norman Mailer\nRight [noise] yes ah the white negro superficial reflections on the hipster was written by Norman Mailer for dissent magazine in Nineteen fifty seven negro was a term used at the time by black Americans\nMay have argued in his essay that Nazi atrocities and the atomic bomb produced a widespread fear that we're all doomed that human extinction was imminent\nHe argued that this situation produced the phenomenon of hipsters have chosen not to live in fear but to reject what he called a slow death by conformity and escape boredom by unleashing their desires they chose to live in the present and celebrate energy in constant movement to swing\nHe wrote that they rejected the moral judgments of the past to experience immediate pleasures instead\nAnd for this mailer argued they turned to the example of African Americans because of slavery and a modern day racism knew all about how everyday life was dangerous and found refuge in pleasures of the body like dance and music\nOn the essay is actually offensive for the way of essential lives as African Americans associating them with the body over the mind with sexuality and heat and there's some these false stereotypes dated back to the ideology of slavery\nMailer was rightly criticized for example by the African American author James Baldwin who said that the essay infuriated him for its perpetuation of mess\nCurrent I Wonder what you thought was noon may lose argument the idea that just the fact being block somehow can pose Qunu hips the

don't want the concentration of power in so few hands\nNow it was also fascinating is that because we have such a small court\nUm during confirmations we actually have less scrutiny I Know that sounds counter intuitive but there are so important that both sides sort of avoid asking substantive questions\nSo constitutional change would be one way to deal with the crisis that's come out of this

about the identity of Alex Michigan and he's under Michigan\nWhen they see is a a report from the battling kept investigative groups I specialize in open source investigations and they were the ones who identified the first that individual if the two are they put out a pretty detailed report which explains how they came to the conclusion for instance looking at them ...\nAll right cool it's possible uh application files doing facial recognition looking at ... academy a graduation reports a whole to try anti ... to the ... in Michigan and say that they have the same person\nAnd certainly people lodged in Geneva I don't dispute the fact that that's the identification no surprise disease a member of the G O U Russian military intelligence to interesting is that he's a thought to be a doctor\nOr a medical doctor which of course that may tie in to the use of nerve agent that that could be someone who was part of a team precisely because none of them was being deployed either to protect the individuals who to know how to deal with him\nAnd another piece in the puzzle though of the makeup of that alleged team at all the script Paul Nurse nerve agent poisoning\nThat's right ah um and I think it's surprising about this really is the fact that it ... ... ... is the outsiders have been able to identify two Russian military intelligence officers and tied them\nTo the geo you into an people who were supposed to be on the cover and I think you know he's a ... something which will I think worry the authorities in most guy who's the ease with which not as dumb\nAnd Nichols comes just a few days off to a full ... team was exposed to buy the Dutch government they're trying to hack into the organization for the prohibition of the ... of chemical weapons in the Netherlands and so I think it is that sense of trying to put as much into the public to Maine in the hype of exposing an impact pressuring the jail you average activities\nAnd and that's really interesting what you're saying about the availability of this information because this ... this latest development about Alexander Michigan comes off the back of the u._k. the U.S and other governments have you were saying accusing him and and and bringing prove against Russian cyber some sabotage and and other kinds of\nAn espionage how does that you can't react how does the west generally react to this\nWell I I think well in some cases they've this I think a ... a a a degree of unity which is probably some people I'm a last week you sue the U.S\nThe u._k. and the Netherlands will come out on the same day\nAnd to criticize the geo you and and ... to specify wanted to be not to when it came to kind of cyber activities now they spend in ... it's not a government document you know we will be nice for the government but I think that same sense so the the best perhaps way of dealing with these activities by shining along to them\nAny reaction from Moscow\nNo not yet uh I think ... we've had some skepticism before of course we should say that the two individuals who have been named as a G O U offices\nOr have denied it and they came on on on T.

I'm\nHappy to be here thank you ... and Ken I'm very happy to be here wonderful now my feet were wrongly the beauty business gets a lot of flak about the weight pedals particular beauty mess that this is the cream the gel the treatment that's going to transform you and your life and you're gonna look better and better\nDo you feel that your businesses add to that pressure yeah this is something that we have to deal with every day when it comes to creating the product services we can't let that connection human connection and the skills to speak for itself\nBut when it comes to ... how do we then market and tell people that this is something that really works because I was actually very very little legislation governing how people market that claims and it meeting lives on the integrity of the business itself\nIs a good thing that that caused so much ends are changing and that consumers are getting ... and get away from the minute enough by the way from the ... yes just in general do you think that you're part of\nThis pressure on women to look a certain way\nNo I I don't think so because we are part of skin care having good skin it's a right when your skin has a problem at an ... called a post NATO pigmentation issue it's equivalent to us having a cough all skin is not well it's not healthy\nAnd I think it's absolutely necessary to seek out the kinds of treatment to make sure that it becomes healthy again so in terms of whether or not we are pursuing an unrealistic cents off duty\nWhich then now you know in our world where Instagram and and and this kind of ...\nIt's very rare thing how do we cut through all this noise and provide exactly what we seek to do which is to give the best product Soviet clients can get healthy skin from the inside out that can heal and regenerate itself and\nWe have to be able to like the result speak for itself sort of products must walk\nSo I think that it's not right I think we do have vanity yeah you get to the mall than anything else that's right my preaching to the\nCan [laughter] can I don't know if\nYou nailed it sound it's optional you don't have to\nGet your point I Know what you're saying I paused and he failed law my they sneeze\nDoesn't increase anxiety amongst women\nBook there's always going to be I was already full many many different reasons so although I could say yeah now's are optional\nYou don't have to do them it's more democratic cars and you don't have to be skinny top nails all these things\nThat always will be will go who will be like I Can't afford to go to all announced that for I'm not part of the gang that fall I'm not going to like myself as much as I should do so we definitely a part of\nAn anxiety juicing effect to women but I Would say that we are the lower end of it\nNow I came across a quote from a beauty executives said that mood and beauty has being redefined as health self esteem and in parliament do you agree with that is something\nI Would say that times are definitely changing there's so much about the culture we live in right now which is about ... evil worthy goal roles isn't\nHiding ... advertising ... she used to be about you know hide you'll pen pals and they will like negative connotations but what I find now it's definitely about showcasing the best version of yourself and that's a really exciting change to see\n... what about the term empower men is that isn't Kuwait products\nTo be honest I think when it comes to beauty I Do think that it's a little bit overused I think that the rationale behind it is extremely powerful and impactful but it can be deemed asked a marketing gimmick in in reason yes due to overuse off that worked out a hundred percent agree I\nThink the concept is obviously positives but the way ... along with many many of the words like self cat ... employees and Instagram slogans and only the of the day I was in a very well known British trained [laughter]\nWas cosmetics and every single productive down one oil was a male Saldana\nNow production is a huge gatekeeper for wealth NBC on what you tend to find is very very few of the ... all distributed nationally and globally all founded by women and thought is what I struggle with the empowerment blood used mocked him because you're not truly empowering women 'cause if you\nDate that would be economic empowerment long when it comes to that issue of economic ... bit now with entrepreneurs there's often an origin story that led to your thoughts and your business and somebody I Believe use with ... delayed by a bad experience getting your nails done\nI Would always go and get my Nelson every Friday is this ritual with my friends even as a student was on the shoulders of money we would go and get known and brushed crazy palm trees and all kinds of stuff\nNow is one of the few treatments in each way you can actually have a conversation with someone while it's happening so\nI found the social ritual anyone else doesn't really lovely and then also the designs were amazing I'm like show my identity and I just still stunned to want to scratch with me on on the kind of person who if I see a problem I'll just you know what I'm going to build my own solution\nSo then I was like I'm going to wipe my cell phone and it was all very how posit\nOn three months after I had to walk on now so I don't so while I was twenty four years old for a while I hated it\nYou have to watch the news business efficiently as everything I'm largely an academic cannot like studying and I like fair is about how we communicate refreshing identity and here I was doing a road to an opening chateau\nAnd cooling the council on aging we'd license grind yeah the grind and I I was ... ...\n... I Want to bring you ... did you have any reservations\nAbout going into business with your mother or a question that I often and the and also between yes and no depending on when you ask us but she is an amazing woman with a great passion for skin care\nBut not to discount her but she did not know very much about the business side of things to cause jet secondary education but a really really hard working and diligent woman\nSo and on I ... I graduated from college and decided to just help her do a business plans and help set everything up and so that the post has assigned place\nSo that the mistakes that she made in the past would not happen again so that's how we got stopped that but that was nine years ago and a lot of things have changed since then so that one of the reasons why I decided to joined a business full time was I found that that was a gap between what consumers were looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nAll I Would ...\nI Would say well this is a is a ... process but inside and out a feeling that you'll you'll actually ... to ... to be able to do the things that you need to do my thinking brood see about how things will be marketed at the moment and I think these this big\nSurge into wellness industry and the the the time is very ... and wellness could be anything from you too you know buying your lipstick at lunchtime to help you pick up\nAnd I'm just wondering if these in risk that\nOf we put too much emphasis on ... because he could way I mean every single salon owner will house hundreds of stories about customers coming feeling won't emotion left\nFading another closer to the motion so we find telling me that our you've spent time with someone and improve the quality of that emotional wellbeing thing here is wellness where it's going into the high street and buying a lipstick\nAlthough yeah it does make you feel good it's more of a short lived good humans are social animals and we need connections and I see beauty treatments as one message of which there are many but obviously this is my industry some Trump came in\nThis [laughter] but maybe the services all one method whereby you can feel a close a human connection and that to me it should be valued much more likely than it is so that women don't have to be paid low wages\nPutting this idea of being undermined because this woman for ... what are you from that I absolutely hear from Indiana\nAnd in fact we have taken a very similar approach in terms of\nHow do we increase how much we pay our therapists\nFor the work that they do because for each patient it takes two hours basically each therapies only can take for clients a day\nAnd so by increasing the environment using the best product investing the best equipment so that we can charge a premium allows us to to then be able to pay more but that was what I was referring to asked um choice off the M ...\nHow they would like to structure to business and whether or not because my hair stylist is a guy and his assistance a guy's as well\nAnd in fact the men who are Harris distance I Believe they make about the same as a female ... assistant in Singapore so based on my understanding I'm\nSorry to they make the same when they get to senior level Ninety some famous female hairdressers\nMe off the top you had it's very difficult\nTo do I even while awaiting a chance to to to do and since I was a good question you know I I I Love this kind of ... yeah\nI just feel so passionate about this because it's reflective of so many industries that the very Bolton men and women all on a level playing field for if you go out and I should go up it changes as you go with the NPT yeah very very few women putting\nYes this is something that I Know this is well\nFor hair actually if a style is is the director level whether they're female or male doesn't make a difference in the amount that we pay for them and it doesn't make a difference in the amount that they bring home I've got friends who I personally in this industry and it's more about the level of expertise and you're right that in terms of makeup and hair\nWe do see that Islam is dominated especially in the fashion industry strange needle in the beauty industry we don't see that many men in fact I have had zero in the last nine years of applicants who applied to be a therapist\nSo I think by the fact that there is a very very tiny fraction all next to norm males in this industry it might be a little bit sleeping to say that it's caused our women that's why they're paid low maybe you're right that is very difficult to pay above\nMarket wages for the technicians while doing it but if it's a male technician who is doing any job\nI Believe the pay would be the same as a woman if you know if we compare but as we go up the boardroom yes there is more men but when it comes to small businesses versus a big now to national corporation I think that the game is a very different and I would like to think that women are given very very far apart unity\nIn Singapore at least in the duty industry\nSomebody when you look back at your career yeah what do you consider to be your biggest say and how you recover from it [noise] this is gonna sound so whacked by just don't believe in this whole ...\nThing come on now I'm being serious I actually have ... ... is a celebration of because I mean look at the inside now to Jenny\nJenny was random ... any of the value of ... it was a series of experiments that I learned from\nIf you really want to force me to say a ... I Would say it's not realizing oddly enough the power structures within beauty to not make the right amount of money that I could have made very early on in my career because I was guided wrongly bug powerful men\nRight I Would say that I had many opportunities to capitalize on a trend are created or we were all there was a team\nAnd we change the culture of not allowed to didn't exist in the west how it did not own at no point did any of them and I spoke to who wanted to incest or to buy the product will do anything with me say you need to make project now are the voice of the people are going to make product\nOn basically still you'll stuff see missed some of the changes have we definitely missed out on a political ... Cheney\nI Would be a multi millionaire now in my products in as a ... but instead a license to two guys a license doing my creativity to two guys who made that product and then just don't pay me royalties so you know there were many small examples of\nPlaces where for example there that's that's interesting yeah that would include it a failure because I just love to learn from the rest of the sun appointing like ... and I don't believe that\nThey might I mean one lane you have to say thank you and it was a great one very good one [laughter] but come on [laughter] um it's\nA little bit with loads off challenges and obstacles along the way that two people who I mean in this business an anything I've always always wanted to help people grow helped people become better and be more confident and one of them will be my employees\nAnd two people that I actually grew from scratch and they were really really didn't have confidence why pay for tuition I send them to school\nTo help them build a career one of them actually stole my money from us how this woman and you know [laughter]\nYeah and another one actually decided when she didn't want to work with us anymore\nBecause she's still contract it was because of the um the school fees that we sent her to school with she went to the ministry of labor or got a lawyer and decided to sue us and India and she lost she had to pay us quite a bit but\nIt was very this distress and also the hot ... that came of it at that point it had the choice to decide to continue to trust my people and continue to groom them or to just take away all the privileges when you to change the way we decided to operate and I'm really really glad that we decided to stick with the former because\nYou know we cannot that one person one bad experience changed what we truly believe in\nPutting somebody will have to say thank you both very thank you for helping us thank you so much\nMy guests today have been abused people says pointing and Sharma dean read the conversation has opposed cost it's easy to find and free to download such for BBC the compensation wherever you get your costs thanks for this thing\n\nYou are listening the community supported public radio she can you teach do you want to Austin we are central Texas home for NPR News I'm drinking on all things which are new\n\nYork's the politics showbiz in the middle of a nine we run up to the mid term elections and you can hear the show on 'til you she Saturday morning at\nNine AM it's a one hour roundtable discussion that present deep dive on the major races beams issues defining these twenty eight year march the ... NPR's Saturday morning at nine AM Eugene Ninety One\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh okay we're coming up after the news headlines it's world ... with me to show were the show that laser focused on finding solutions to society's problem around the globe and this week we're looking at the solution that will bring clean drinking water to people who live in slums\nSome you know you've been to the ... slum in Kenya yet they say is a story\nAbout Kenny or day day a man who just loses charisma and he's been battling the mafia ... there's a ... yeah in Kibera and lots of slums across the world\nAccess to the most ... is a real issue and often the market is manipulated a controlled Matthews and cartels\nThey do things like tapping into Maine's will to supplies channeling and we'll see if we ... which means people are getting typhoid and called her a really bad situation about Kenny has an idea to transform all of that and he's flipping anti situation on its head that's world ... coming up after the b._b._c. news\n\nThere's usually somebody manning the top you finished Jerry can you make payments which is about Fifteen twenty shootings right and that's about Fifteen American sense because of the pieces looks is full of sort of bits and pieces\nOf blackrock thinks particles moving and she didn't look busy\nAnd that they see what's available to most residents of beer or you just have dominated with sewage visited\nWe see which is going through the offending people of a sudden you get sick\nYou were drinking they supposed to growing up yes yes I Do watch I don't I wouldn't be drinking is saying\nWe want to know when this water was coming from Kenny was really unsure about showing us but eventually he agreed\nAnd so surrounded by about five of his friends or ... as he called them we climbed into two cars and trucks to the outskirts of the slum people found slow painful wooded area\nUnderneath the bridge where several other guys strangers hit down at us the whole thing this protein that they\nWere right on the outskirts of the some\nWe've been told we have to wait and you don't you guys are going around yeah\nWhere it's like what is the beginning if you look there\nWhich is kind of don't sweat the track Kenny what is this\nSo this is kind of critical connect\nThe pipes on these metal and he's just\nSo that is a big metal type of business on and what not\nAnd then people they were talking about your company didn't break in\nAnd they put the pipes that\nGrows to watch all the way the slump sticking out this big metal pipe as I leave the release of the water\nYeah yeah yeah I was in the water so that water leaking out the main pipe because people have jammed in these makeshift they looked like garden hoses basically sticking out the main pipe that this is illegal right\nYes they're going to see you see that could have hundreds of the pilots could could that mean is one of these ... these are the rich\nWith is that what are you anyway so we have to leave because you want to say you have to let him because he's been at us because of these more like a posting people who they are doing so they don't like it I guess we just really quickly\nSo these guys these guys on the bridge that the glass house yes now that people do believe that we have to be careful OK okay let's go yes\nOkay so I'm really interested in quite tense as well who's ... is this where does it go it's owned by the city council and it goes to a different ... the slum a show it's helped me by the time it reaches its destination it's been so heavily tapped by different call tell us that the supply it puts you limited\nYeah I can imagine that I have to say I'm a bit of concern to feed their retrospectively because it must have been\nTense with with the ... the the standing there looking on you guys a journalist inspecting the completely legal\nSets up did you feel like you were in any kind of imminent danger yeah was it really weighed situation and the only way I can really explain it is that's just Kenny he joked around at one point and he said oh don't worry you're safe with me because I'm the mad that I've got a clip\nThe man that was why Ruben yeah\nNo the elected merits I smelt the mayor but he's incredibly well connected in Kibera everybody seems to Kenny and he noticed that people running the cartels and he has a really interesting story I'll tell you about that in a moment but first let me tell you about solution Sam it's always about solution palate\nRight so ... is a solution at least I'm you remember we visited that cartel controls the kiosk in Kibera at Iran yeah it was a ... black tank ways that people will just coming out the top yeah well Kennedy's NGO shelf has set up its own will to kiosks in the slum and these ones are a bit different\nWe've come to another ... era this one's painted bright blue collar dishes the shelf go\nHe's on the show ... pretty well we have twenty six so how's it going city I don't know too much far from the main sites where we'll just say oh I didn't I was you were only for less than two minutes to get water\nPeople don't want to watch him so that you aim is that ... will be within two minutes walk\nSo yeah before he had people come from this area and because people are now a ... for what I can tell\nThis to green pipe sticking out of this building is that by some of this will to yes I have a bustle here can looks like clean water flowing out of the pipe yes\n[noise] [noise] [noise] the country compared to what I see you gave it to drink some we can drink water because it's clear because\nYeah so it tastes good so we got a twenty to jury can hear how much is the most from this kiosk\nThese what these cures\nFor two shootings ... twin ...\nOkay so it's much cheaper

H. race assistant director general for emergencies no stop to Mike Ron How worried as the about the outbreak sprinting\nWe're certainly concerned uh we have a very a a big operation in in North Carolina tore a containing the virus I currently or where it's spreading a the the difficulty we have is the security context in which that's happening is very very challenging\nAnd when you say that you mean fighting between different armed groups yes\nAnd there have been a number of attacks by by armed groups or a every every day or two really over the last number of weeks or our our teams have not been directly targeted but obviously or wherever there and it's very difficult to maintain a operations\nAnd even even without that there are challenges in terms of the response it's spread out over a large\nArea now I'm a logistics are quite challenging and um we have had some uh mistrust and resistance at the community level as well which in itself has been challenging [noise]\nUm I I Want to get on to that and the ... in a moment but just on the on the the the the wider security situation what does that mean for humanitarian workers who simply mean they kind of get out into the field and to do the work if they were shooting going on\n[noise] ah well unfortunately first that that's hardly a choice when the two Bola I bowl at us in restive we rest and the bonuses and stuff we stopped so uh the operational parents is to get out into the field to trace cases find contacts vaccination\nContacts in context of contacts using giving ring vaccination strategy so for us it's an absolute imperative to be out there we do all desert rats chewed to a new school to the UN peacekeeping operations there who have\nProvided excellent security for our teams and we have not been directly targeted but certainly the violence on the attacks have really increased the level of press they've also increase the amount of security apparatus in the amount of security arrangements we have to put in place so that's increasing the demands on the operational teams it's it it also increases the stress levels\nAmongst our staff so the length of time anyone can stay in the field a short because of those stress levels\nSo it's a little bit about mistrust amongst local communities particularly as I understand that with regard to the people's ability to to carry out traditional burials which may not be be be safe and this has led to a few attacks on humanitarian workers have you ever come up\nIt's difficult we we've seen this in many many ... and I and I think you know in context if if if if you have a death in any community and that doesn't matter if it's a north cable or or or north London\nOr this is a risk disease that people have taken away quickly in a in a very very severe way I'm communities react to that uh they have very traditional means of of caring for of preparing buddies for burial and burying people in the spiritual aspect of this is is is very very important\nSo when outsiders coming to remove Bobby's when outsiders coming to remove sick people with communities can react\nAh and react very negatively so we have a lot of work with communities to engage them to discuss to talk to negotiate and by and by and large that goes extremely well we're very skilled communicators local Congolese on an on an international stuff who do that\nBut on occasion that dozens a goal so well I'm In particular situations and we've seen this and and witness this recently where there has been a an element of manipulation or\nA triggering of death response by elements within the community who are are looking to create and foment political or community um disruption or so when you have a single incident it can grow into a much larger incidents\nOf very often that's that's driven by individuals on the community we're really pushing the community towards that kind of response this is a very um disrupted a community or they've\nHad ten Twenty years of war they've had attack after attack they've had massacres or are they bulldozed is just the latest scourge that they're having to suffer\nA one question on on vaccines um after the outbreak of course in West Africa how much of a game changer has that been your ability to contain this outbreak\n[noise] um I think it has been a huge gauging change or into a ... down\nThe lines of data will tell us just how effective it was in the science in scientific terms um and we believe it is effective and has been proven to be effective in the past a village level it is a huge game changer because in the past we come to very bodies we come to take sick people away now we come with vaccine\nAnd if you're in the village of a hundred or two hundred people who are almost everyone has been exposed\nA bringing a vaccine that offers hope to those people that they may not get the disease and they may not die creates a huge demand from the community for that service or an changes I said to them to pass to\nAh walking into villages in the past I was it was a seeing people with terror and the rice now you see people who have open their eyes they're not happy either upset they've lost a loved one would at least they can have their children vaccinated and that's changing the dynamic\nBut having said that even with that vaccination available even with new therapeutics available at the treatment units which is again a game changer\nAre there are still pockets in the community of deep mistrust this mistrust goes back a very long time and that mistrust chemically manipulated as\nAn can be turned against the international teams uh and we just have to work through that we have to grind through that in the daily communications process with those communities it's made all the more difficult because our time with those communities is limited by the generals security situation\nSo it's like a double whammy you can't operate completely freely you can spend the time you need to

I Love live on also on my show them all over them very well here I Am\nComing up after the latest news\nOf former senior national security council advisor who oversaw the un says in the a bummer administration now spread Blakeman agree with that assessment that Nikki Haley went from a never Trump to if conservatives stupid stuff\nI think that's true and like so many people who are serving stranger perhaps they are not\nInitially supportive of the president when he got the nomination they back their party's candidate and they chose to serve and Halley short with distinction issue is a rock star at the un\nCertainly credible and that great assistance to our country great help to the president so she will do this\nSteven company or assessment\n[noise] so I think the domestic political assessment is probably right I think you know certainly her star rose in conservative political circles here in the United states\nThink she gets more mixed marks for her performance at the United nations I think her legacy includes pulling the United states back from institutions that advanced U.S interests and values like\nThe human rights council and other bodies I think also she will probably be associated with the politicization of humanitarian assistance in terms of\nThe U.S going back for its support for Palestinian refugees and I think we're approach to human rights has been pretty highly selective and I think that that will over the long term probably hurt us credibility on those issues yet\nYou had those assessments that she was dancing on the way out to what she's saying do you think amongst the had diplomatic comb friends that she was in it to a certain extent a more outwardly looking possibly administration than others so I think you know\nTo some extent people were probably quite worried when the Trump Administration was coming in that they didn't know what to expect and whether or not the you know administration might turn its back entirely on the United nations and\nYou know to give appropriate credit I think she did protect to some extent you know the budget that the United states put into the United nations and the relationship between\nSenior U.S officials and senior un officials and I'm sure that her colleagues at the United nations were very grateful for that\nRed light man who do you think will should come next\nI think somebody who will continue the legacy\nOf ambassador Haley to my friends comments or we had a lot to clean up after the Obama administration or their policy apologies appeasement didn't work very well because our country or any of the older the surge and change its happened under\nPresident Trump has been one putting America First college at it for that was certainly a good day to our friends and stand up for this series and somebody with you on that industry should it was very short America is just another neighbor in the neighborhood\nThat's nuts I should never drive for\nAll that speed bump will come back to that but but just on who the next ambassador who don't own might be what are your thoughts hopes\nLight my thoughts in hopes are going to be that it's going to somebody's strong like ambassador Haley can give comfort to our friends and cause some ... to our\nAdversaries enemies you wind up at a great part or to the United states as a matter of fact the organization they pulled out of it was a return on investment for getting the return on investment we're investing organizations that are hostile to the United\nStates even with the kind of a\nRun let let's let's get see even pump his view on this I mean whoever does replace that we're going to get the same would you see I think you're going to get\nSomebody who works well with former Ambassador John Bolton was not a national security advisor at the White House is somebody who's obviously got very specific sort of hard line views on the United nations um\nAnd I think it's become very active and managing U.S policy there so I'd expected to be somebody who you know is that you have more of the same are actually closer or frankly to Bolton ideologically\nAnd as to the points that Brad Blanton was making\n[noise] yeah I just don't know I don't agree obviously fundamentally I think\nYou know obviously multilateral institutions aren't going to align themselves with us all the time but um when the U.S participates when it throws its weight behind a efforts at these institutions that can be very effective when you look at for example Myanmar and the ethnic cleansing of the atrocities against the range of that's an issue that\nNikki Haley cares about the institution of the UN that's been the most vocal and and sort of forward leaning on those issues has been the human rights council she herself\nSight of the human rights council in her you wrote a human rights council reporting to remarks to the Security Council at the end of August but at the same time she is undermining human
