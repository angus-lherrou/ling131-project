{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "I think a big part of it has to do with the fact that Minnesotans tend to vote right we have Ninety percent voter turnout when in presidential years and so we have high information voters and they really do vote and so in a lot of these places where we are seeing\nProgressive candidates I'm really galvanized inserted hadn't and when I'm there engaging new folks who haven't really been part of the process before they're now boating and here we got to persuade kind of the same group of people to vote for us and so we\nDid have the endorsement of our party um but we did have some folks who are not keen on the quote unquote metro ticket um we also you know there was a little bit on the flip of politics of joy at the politics of fear\nOn Tim Pawlenty who was our former governor before our current governor and ran for president was running in the primary and people were very scared of having\n... the next governor and so I think when it came down to it um they thought you know I just I Can't have Tim Pawlenty the governor and so I Want to make sure that we went and I think that this there is a different ticket that you know as as close to my values it might not be everything um but\nI have the feeling that certain types of folks in Minnesota are more likely to vote for that person and they may or may not have been wrong but I think there is a little bit of that fear that was baked into\nUm some decisions but\nAt the same time you know we had to really great candidates um we had a a surprise third candidate that entered the race um the last day of filing it was our attorney general I'm Laurie Johnson and then her running mate was the congressmen up in the eighth district and the iron range who was actually supposed to be retiring and so it kind of\nShook things up in a weird way and I think it took awhile for folks to kind of get their footing um and so I think at the end of the day you know we\nWe just didn't pulling the numbers and we probably could have organized a little bit better on the field and\nWe could have um you know gotten Tamar places and and sets more things you know the the standard things for white people lose campaigns but the good news is is that we have um a great endorsed ticket now in Minnesota to malls and picket line again and they are definitely going to beat a Jeff Johnson in November which is exciting\nSo I mean what an incredible experience and and I'm sure that you put in so much energy in into making that a success while also still doing your job as a representative ... but you put your job as representative on the line because you you can't\nYou can't do both right so ... what what next you know\nA right now I'm working for Angie Craig who was running for Congress in ... she is I think the top or one of the top flip districts and the nation I'm running against Jason Lewis who won two years ago with forty seven percent of the vote 'em and she ran against him last time so we got one point eight percent more in us and after that\nUh you know see how things shake out from the elections I'd love to work for elected officials again until I decide to run again and I do plan on running for office again because I really enjoy policymaking I'm a huge policy and aren't and if you like policy\nYou should make policy [laughter] sounds like a good numbers are going to say so Aaron you you've you've you've been up you've been down [laughter] I'm Serious what what is the best advice that anyone's ever given you about picking yourself back up and again and and moving forward you know\nWhen I was a really really little kid I made a mistake and\nAccidentally lied about it I didn't really realize that the thing that I had done was the thing that someone had asked me about and so I said no that wasn't me and it was me and I realized that like a day later and I felt so guilty for it and my mom just said well first go back and apologize and tell the truth and then she said I'm\nIn a little while and won't feel so bad and a little while after that it won't feel so bad and a little while after that won't feel so bad like it'll you won't always feel this way\nAnd so my advice to everyone else that I was given that is a very I was like in fifth grade when I did this um\nMistake that I did is that it won't always feel this way and so don't get so mired down and everything that you feel right now because it won't always feel this way but use how you feel right now to fuel yourself\nLater you know remember why it doesn't feel that right now so that when you have to give the extra bit later on that I don't want to feel like that again or if you win and it feels really good remember how it felt to win so that [noise] the next time [laughter] you're like I don't want to do this anymore you remember how good it feels to be triumphant on the other and\nAt age thirty to Minnesota state representative Aaron equate is position

most of the people they are really excited I think it was on\nAn emotional boost when they cross the border so that the president announced that it was going to be close so I think they're keeping their spirits high end just waiting to see what happens tomorrow when they reach the Mexican border\nBut how excited I mean it it's just really difficult to comprehend that big as a treat to two days

money will be given in tens of aid to the country and then you had that warning from the ... government as well I ... how are they still excited because once they get to the border they they're bound to you know to to come up with probably already five hundred troops at least in Mexico being a you know being\nA recruited especially for their counting\nWell you'd have to also consider the these people as soon as they crossed into the memorial they have lost reception on their phones so they're not keeping tracks with the news um I think also what some of the people are saying is that they're taking every step at a time\nWhen the ... with them on President announce that the border was going to be close or some of the people were just waiting okay this is our first obstacle as soon as we cleared the one we're going to focus on the next one so right now a ... knife in ... city trying to see\nTo find parts for taste and to get it to the border so that's the current obstacle tonight and wants to clear that one once they reach the Mexican more I think that until then that they're going to worry about what happens there\nBut they do they not have any idea as to what my confront them if they managed to get past to Mexico to the U.S Florida\nOh no they do they know about the ... the drug cartels they know about the criminality and the violence they know about a migration and Mexico

the so called Islamic state in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt\nThat's a question that's worrying with such as he's been looking into the situation in the week the Egyptian army said that four hundred

had to sell to an attack on a mosque in the middle of the ... which killed more than three hundred people\nSo how much off the track is the uh yes and the ... in the Sinai corner tucked in some ... who has has just published a study on the good\nWell you know without fear mongering I think it's an incredible threat based on a couple of factors the first is the ability to bought and\nExecute spectacular attacks or if you think back to the Russian airliner that was down to using\nA a bomb that was discussed in a soda can clearly the capabilities there I see the other piece to it is the sanctuary and safe haven that's provided by such austere terrain you know these guys have pretty much a free rein\nTo move around the northern China as they please and then the third critical factor is really the ineptitude of the Egyptian army\nAnd that is the big question because by regional stand in Cairo maintains a real bass conventional miniature ... that what are they not getting to try and come this\nExactly they're not considering I'm a hearts and minds approach whatsoever or they're not engaging in a parsimonious use of force in fact they are doing just the opposite they're engaging and scorched earth tactics or and so they're not attempting to separate the insurgents from the population\nAs we know and classic counterinsurgency doctrine\nA or best practices so they've ignored on that\nLeslie they've outsourced a portion of the counter insurgency the Israelis who've taken over a in a covert matter um although not covert enough because here we are talking about it a a significant portion of the air power involved and bombing I asked a physician's throughout Shonda\nWhat makes up the ice affiliates in the Sinai\n[noise] oh it's a collection of local groups or Egypt has dealt with Islamic radicals dating back\nDecades there's been a you know robust sales or the ... slum of jihad group that al ... has current leader ah and former deputy dominoes watery led a and so there's fertile infrastructure for this group to grow and again the other pieces the Bedouin culture\nIn parts of the sun I fiercely autonomous to seriously anti authoritarian um and so that in many ways leads to an anti government position from from the get go\nAnd here's the interesting thing Egypt has been so desperate to try and quality in ... the ... yeah that'd be the the government has even tend to these rainy but how so more help needed because that's these ratings providing assistance to ... ... what about the international players\nYeah showed classic Middle East the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd I sold discussion about who should be on it and I just thought you know what it would be great to have more minorities on that has never been an ethnic minority face and then I thought of my heroin and actually what I did was I I I put together a petition and I immediately contacted two two people one was talking about and pay\nAnd he sat on plastic this is brilliant and he started tweeting and what type of strikes away and immediately to historians lift responded to him this is the perfect person Tom Holland and down snow and from there you know people just sort of smell bold and then I and I often tell mama\nTell mama UK that deals specifically and helping people navigate prejudice and actually Muslim hatred and they thought wow\nYou know they came on board because because it's important in today's day and age with with with with ... with rising tolerance rising anti Semitism right rising anti Muslim hatred and it also decision to tell these positive stories open fire and role models from all communities and\nYou know I just tell young people that they exist people young young people like me growing up who who would love to hear about these stories do you think it might happen I Hope so I think what's important is this the emotional\nMessage of this campaign\nThe fact that she is somewhat unknown as you shouldn't be second Fox at her story is one of the meant spring free\nAnd it resonates people it's positive all purchase cost that includes the story of someone from the commonwealth countries who just hugely and we really we are a

slightly in the negative one said well why you know when they called it virtual signaling that you know why does have to be a Muslim why does it have to be a woman that the second negativity is has been if I'm going to be very honest\nPersonal it's being racist that just proves to me that it's very important to show the example of\nSomeone who was Muslim who was a woman who who stood up for freedom for British values that sucked the the kind of integration he's a role model we should have and you know what that's such a story puts Tibet\nThe racist and those who would try and divide us

pressures that are created one of ... farms rearrange as the Adams and when you do that you have a new mineral we call it ...\nAnd what is so significant say citing about ...\n[noise] well one of the things that we have to step back and think about is ah in the evolution of earth it's important to know how often do extinction level impact event happen on earth [laughter]\nThat's really important to know or you could think of it as a matter of human security\nFrom a space space hazard\nFor people that want something a little closer to home to recognize with five years ago a fireball called Chelyabinsk street strict across the sky of Russia and caused a lot of property damage um that demonstrated that these kinds of events are very rare and just restricted to the geological past\nAnd that Russian fireball was a piece shooter compared to the site that we study\nSo it will tell us more about the site because it was in shock may I understand ah ah some that are quite a few way away from puff how exactly did you discover these ... yeah\nThat's right it's been known for some time but there's a large impact crater in the city of shark bay on the western coast of Australia and the Geological Survey of Western Australia drill death site in two thousand and one they had to drill it because it's buried\nTime since the impact formed it's been covered by younger rocks and sediments and so if you go visit there today you can't see any evidence of the cosmic cataclysm that happened when the impact farm\nSo they took drill core from the site and they made initial studies almost Twenty years ago and\nThat resulted in a dispute about to start some one camp said it was closer to about fifty kilometers in diameter the other camp said she's this thing might be really big it might be over a hundred and twenty kilometers in diameter and that\nA dispute has kind of lasted all over the course of almost two decades so\nOn and there's got to worry if what ended the the defeat\nWell a like a lot of things in science new observations bring new insight when we went and examined the um twenty year old drill core we\nWent in with new eyes and new instruments and we found this microscopic mineral re die that instantly increased pressure um that these rocks felt in terms of when a when an impact occurs crunches the rocks like an accordion\nAnd the identification of ... and the score set cheese this pressure was even bigger and so that favors a larger crater sides\nAnd they didn't choose that this was found by challenged by accident I Want to be at least that you\nIt's a great story it just wasn't a researcher it's one of our undergraduate students ... in the space science and technology center courting university ah her name is mark and Cox she's an undergraduate doing an honors project and I I Can't think of a more brilliant person to to lead this\nIt was her idea to reexamine this whole drill core and to look at some of those are cons to see what was going on with them you don't set out to find it every time it's found that the chance discovered so there's a lot of serendipity\nDoes you know\nFantastic uh she's just finishing her honors project this

World Service I'm Jordan dive bar and find ...\nComing up curious world open secrets or something wrong ... for decades while everyone turns a blind eye is it fear for ourselves stops us from blowing the whistle or the desire to leave a group\nFinds out white seems tough economy was such popular pride when as last week\nOn memorial prize and economic scientists was voted jointly to William ... house and pull run to find out more about that what I spent two women that biggest fans Kim hall said\n... ... fine thank you very much tell you I'm\nPleased to be on the other side of the microphone any or about two of my favorite economists\nWhen you're not house and pull Roma where I think talk of most people's lists to win it still means this is a bit of surprise because I think people have made a connection between that worked and worked together I think it makes perfect sense ... uh-huh why they vote study gross\nAnd they both study we did the invisible products on consequences of drugs so no house studies climate change\nAnd the way that climate change interacts with the economy\nAnd the way that policies that we might implement to deal with climate change how they might affect the economy so you can also questions like should we love your carbon tax will be two economically damaging how many jobs when it costs would actually save the pilots are no that's the folks of note houses modeling and he's been working on this since Nineteen Seventy five\nRoma focuses on what causes gross\nAnd what causes drugs according to Rome is ideas there is a wonderful connection I think between that work because if the economy is going to continue to grow and we're going to do something about climate change we're going to need to do more with less and that's going to require better ideas\nDo you think that the see themselves have the answer to this question's\nRoma wrote a blog post saying that we should be conditions in the optimistic optimistic because we can do something about climate change but conditional to mistake because we actually have to put our finger out and take action serious action\nWe going to have to produce a valuable product we're gonna have to produce them more efficiently less use of energy and particularly with less use of carbon dioxide now what both men would say is the obvious way to do that\nIs to put a price on carbon dioxide most dreadful rates do that is a tax on top and\nIf you do that and everything that you do in the economy that involves carbon dioxide emissions is going to get a bit more expensive\nAnd that means there are lots of things that people all through the economy will do to ensure that less about happens so that could be anything from a better product designed to changes in human behavior to a cleaner sources of fuel\nSo they believe that if you tax carbon dioxide that's getting to create more ideas which will and in at ... upon it\nAbsolutely build an old house I think has suggested about forty dollars a ton of carbon dioxide is a big number if you fly shall who you are personally contributing about a quarter of a ton of half a ton of carbon dioxide\nTwenty dollars here twenty dollars back again it increases the cost of your plane ticket by forty dollars that's not trivial for cheap flight\nThat is one of the interesting questions that bill load house his work addresses if we're going to have a carbon tax there's a level is too low and that'll make no difference who change their behavior that level it's so high that it would just immediately crashed the economy\nHow big does your eyes have today to win an adult prize\nIn economics you know what House his idea is not radical atoll his achievement is he actually got off his backside and try to model it Roma he had a radical technical break through his technical breakthrough laws\nWe're trying to model this process of economic growth it is obvious to everybody that involves technical progress and they're both doing things better now before I wrote him a everybody knew that but nobody could produce a mathematical model that describes that process Rodman was the person\nWho was able to make the equations work so that you could describe mazel where\nIndividual companies have an incentive to spend money on research and development and those incentives could be\nImproved over juiced and how that would only interacts and produce a Muslim ... economic growth happens\nIt wasn't the idea that ideas master it was actually making it work in the language that economists on stand that breakthrough paper was Nineteen Ninety\nHaving done that he basically quit academia and he said yeah I'm done with this this is fine uh I've written this pay for everyone's hasn't really got the Nobel Prize a hamster cameras down there really was like not everyone did cite that will win the Nobel Prize\nYou set up an online learning company called ...\nThis is before online learning was cool he sold the company and they can make quite a lot of money he then\nHad an even bigger idea he said the ... election on the ground is there are places that doesn't have stable institutions and rules and norms build a building someone's gonna come and ask you for a bribe although knock it down you can't take disputes to cool\nThere's no functioning banking system and so you've got countries that are incredibly pool but lots and lots of entrepreneurial activity but like they can't develop how can we solve a problem\nRome is that we need a new Hong Kong Hong Kong is this little place on the coast of China which has British imperial rules\nThose rules were very successful and Hong Kong becomes this tremendous economic success story and then becomes a gateway for China as China stops to a film so he says well what can we do that again\nAnd I'm not a whole and all the ... the same rules because what really\nMade the difference with the rules if you get the rules right and that credibility about the rights institutions you can do it all again and China was doing this in cities all along the coast but what about an African country for example where\nIs this really troubled history of colonialism and then the post colonial governments have often been very corrupt not democratic so ... and this is a super controversial idea regular says\nWhy doesn't say no Mauritania contract out a little bit of swam to Canada and say Canada when you run this place is not worth anything to us\nBut it might be something if Canada set up all the rules and than anyone in Mauritania could emigrate little chunk of Canada Kennedy rooms rules it's not colonialism because no one has to go there is no compulsion and then maybe we get a new Hong Kong\nI mean you can eat today that I can see why that could go horribly wrong it could go horribly wrong you and you could see why a lot of people would find it offensive but you can't accuse the\nGuy I'm not having any ambition oh I'm for it on coal he went to the world bank as chief economist going into arguments with basically every other economists will back he's not a diplomat in the end he said you know what I'm going to go back to academia just in time to collect Nobel Prize very interesting character\nSome people listening might find around is frustrating because some people say well economic ... is the whole problem with the planet yeah yeah and climate change is an issue because we just keep producing more and more and more and it's not sustainable\nWell I have a lot of sympathy with that about my sympathy is limited by a chick completely mind opening pipe that we didn't know what House produced in the Nineteen nineties he says what about like what about illumination\nHow much does it cost us to illuminate room\nBack in the day you have to jump out of

minutes by the end of this practice my dad was twentieth century\nWe can kind of say well this is a lie and this is telling the truth you know why is I don't pay pretty black and white why the shades of gray and they will come with that shades of gray which will be well either everybody else is doing it I thought it was someone else's responsibility to report this if it's not I don't see is my

everybody does it it it's very common practice it so I ... I might slightly more money on this deal than the client thinks I did it's not even technically\nIllegal not permissible it's just not completely ethical either so why do people keep secrets\nAnd that's a very big question I think there are lots of different ...\nAnd I think the main pieces you know certainly from a ... perspective trading flu is highly competitive highly charged environments

way of looking at it is that those people who are managing financial institutions\nAnd asking whether they found all not tend to look at them one by one and what we know that financial crises is that there's a domino effect and the way one bank notes down another bank is that they lend to each other and I'm very into was in way so they build\nModels not where one dumbing down notes down enough of them now they build models actually with that if that wasn't bad [noise]\nWon't solve these models exactly the ways of trying to predict what will happen if you're just one thing say prices interest

economists note that economic crisis occurred was disturbing regularity\nHow to that story of assuming away those things that were dangerous\nList because economics had had quite a lot of success so if you look back at the ten years before the financial crisis also that what you call it a great in moderation\nAnd what that meant was the boom and bust didn't seem to be with us so we're still to

people to get stuck in to improve our economic literacy\nJust like the statistics will politics picking up a basic knowledge of economics however we learn this means we can better understand the world

jobs especially journalists me to take more interested in economics rather than leaving it to the experts\nA better understanding of how the economy works a better understanding of economic history and a better understanding of how different countries operate\nIs going to provide much broader basis of understanding so that when something new chance up like the threat of trade was\nThen the kind
