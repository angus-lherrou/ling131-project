simple and as a tree and then they can be born as a dog [laughter] and there's all these different lives but obviously it's unwieldy and it doesn't work and it would be ridiculous so in the end\nI just thought well I can simplify that structure in just literally life after the ice and said that he doesn't annoyed by me and the region with its multiplicity 'cause it's actually a lovely ... shift to write a lot of people say to me it's already\nComplicated book and I'm always like you know ways that complicated because it's a simple if it does what it says on the ... is life after a lot so I Know she lives she does she live she dies it's just very kind of oceanic so to have rhythm to it so\nI just didn't have the the placebo the material the scene that I wanted to use that stuck to wait

Concord New Hampshire in the usa Virginia macgregor who has got to sort of follow up question to that's in the way the junior high would you like to ask your question please\nI left they think he'd say I love the premise that the hostages life afterlife and did it passes the existence of space and safe routes out and say full of possibilities and it feels to me like a\nMagical but it was safe I real way of staying at human life um and I was wondering advocate we'll let you this way thinking I'm positive it might it be and you write to them as a nation which dreams up a million different possibilities like how is that I Want whether they'll stay the way\nAnd mother has the the child's life I'm I'm the mother she got out and that has a boy and the way and I sat and they have this fear that fertility but also said hype of the many possibilities that lie ahead of them cuts that in my mind and I'm just fascinated now what led you if the prime it\nIt's a good question um I've never related it to my children say most of my\nImagination I think I'm the everyone has the same ... about what I Would have done if I you know if I could live over again what would I Do and how would I Do different names and because we always stumbling the fat because children because we can't get rid of them in the ... what I had my children you know he is but [laughter] what would I done and so\nWe caught well perhaps in the world of quantum physics which is a mystery to me we are all the eating part of their lives anywhere multiple lives but I think\nThe great joy fiction is that you can

like ... of course it was ... she came back and once\nPeople over ... you know people become ghost so they they they live again or that that fear of not existing and I think we have very ... very short and it it's nice to imagine all the different things that could have happened about that happening\nWe're letting you know quite different lives somewhere\nYes but we don't know about it it's just the problems anyway [laughter] maybe that's the saving grace you're quite right up which Virginia McGregor thank you very much onto an email\nNow which comes from Brooklyn in New York in the U.S

I became aware of is born there was some ... ... is about the bombing will just the different kinds of or that in my life has to life than the ... center of the book is the plates\nAnd I did realize that there's no such things we don't know there's an awful lot of sense that we're not uh publicize because they would have been bad from around our view is that what we've colored through the propaganda that existed at the time and a lot of it is is you know that very gung ho kind of things at the ministry of information to pushing it and I think\nThe actual feeding and the temperature of the people at the time was much darker than that and much less ... in many ways because the will became about survival rather than ... justice and in some ways and I think it was just discovering statistics which will horrible that\nBombing you know building debts and the and the different various bombings\nThat I think [noise] see I understand I'm not sure that I did in a way I think I just felt\nIt more because I really like creating an atmosphere in books I read like creating the ambulance enough people that I I really was able to enter into that and that was my wave experiencing the war I suppose but yes I Do I still feel I just missed it because I was born\n[noise] five six years afterwards and said that there when I was growing up I was very conscious and oh my uncles it's a term that my father was a coal miner ... they will have very different experiences which I didn't have access to so that was a way maybe it was just a selfish thing on my ...\nJohn ... says I'm going to take a risk kids while you are you [laughter] are you old enough to have remembered as a very small child for the moment of London was like in the second world\nWar I was writing Lucerne or was a small child and the time which I Do have specific\nMembers over ... ... ... ... in my mind um\nDid did you feel you're talking some captured it the way you remembered it\nWell certainly the booming I'm American and members shooting London on the phone which in some fruit of my bedroom window ... from\nThe other thing was on was very ugly ... particularly as long as I grew up thinking about two of our became older\nChild ... or ... was a little randomness Mm mhm mhm you bring my account and some of your accounts of the bombing mhm I'm ... ... well the places in one\nWon't ... ... which is another point because my mom was a little swimming Tommy run them\nYet because they didn't get the great myths of the the bombing more but science as they were targeting accurately which of course they had no idea what bums we're voting in the U.S we didn't when we pull this so that was entirely just happened to be you know most most bumps fellows talented unfortunately on people but\nWe're talking of the bombings those another question from Isabella Maya in El Salvador and Central America who wrote I was completely taken aback by the description of the blitz when she was trying to survive this ordeal to the point I felt I was that\nSo I was wondering about the research and the amount of time this must have taken to make the reading so visit\nI was such a something you forget once you've done so that was really sad how long did you search for how much she says you and I'm like oh\nI don't know I Can't remember but such different these days when I wrote behind the scenes that museum it was amazing ate before the Internet\nAnd you would do what you do is done you'd go to the library or you go to a reference library and you'd take notes and you would order books and it was time consuming and then the Internet came and it says everyone was very dubious about the accuracy of information on the Internet and then I think we've got a new company [laughter]\nBut you do not always use such as you go no if you have a question you know if he's up so it's much more seamless process was you know before you could say oh I spent three months and in the library was searching on this but now you don't know because it happens while you're raunchy although\nUs thinking ... plus out what's going to happen and I tried doing that\nAnd then ... minutes I start the very first would book everything changes so I've had to learn to trust a moral panic structure because\nIt's on you when I'm writing that I actually managed to think properly about the book I mean I Do it so I never make notes and sometimes I'll story bought things if I Need to keep a bit of a track that midlife afterlife very little of that when children because I just went with a natural rhythm of it\nBut if you do is I don't you occasionally reach a point to the regime but you think\nYou're going that well [laughter] I wasn't going to offset but I'm\nNot old they are and this is a discount what my way through the ... ...\nSometimes there's usually a bit round about two thirds of the way through way you get stuck better I think it's anything to do with\nKeeping track of what's happening I think that just because she let things run away with you a bait and you have to rain demand and saying oh well that doesn't look I Need to think differently about it or it's just a sort of crisis moment that you have I think but on the whole I Love structure but I'm not\nI don't feel the need to start to finish because\nThe pleasure of an oval is that you find out what you learned to write so if you do look to everything and then use more or less contained yourself I think you need to have that freedom to discover because I think you'd be quiet bowed if you were writing something that you knew what was going to happen so it's certainly\nSomething structural though I Will maybe make notes about I think I'm I'm starting back to last week I did a story about the less the quite so when you say stores will refer to describe what no actually I'm just advertising and most ... book because they've got little\nPanels it it's meant for people that would allow us to talk to a drawing or graphic so that you can actually see each scene\nSo sometimes I Need to do that so I can work out because I moved chapters around when I'm watching I don't know it was like ... to see how things fit together so I sometimes do that or the very big piece of paper\nBut on the whole everything's in my head which is why I forget everything quite easy because if you're holding everything in your head and the minute you finish she just like we've ... now I don't need to remember any of that and so it's it's all going into the book so it's not taking the limited space in my brain\n[laughter] rubbish\nSo ... in Pennsylvania and the usa asks to this ... house I'll just find what was it for you as a right to to give you a ... 'cause every ending from actually the wretched to hop the ever often\nVery satisfied I think I Would say I I'm I loved endings anyway I Love the Endings That books I like that I never I ... it was several endings so it was\nReally satisfying to be able to do things again and again and again uh differently um so you you you have limited you're so\nParticularly she with us you know because she is the my parents have but I Love minor characters I Love minor characters that was nice to keep bringing them back and do different things that I'm missing about\nAnd you even you even have some rabbits and the ... who on some in some versions of events die horribly and in some of it's not really going to pick the girl\nThat golden around [laughter] I I was very glad to see that they have their civil resuscitation some [laughter]\nAnd is either my name's Janice ... green in summary my question is why there's so many stories of multiple lines\nRichard ... both Rachel's story twelve hundred and one of us who knew all the time and such has gone to a day at the time and time meeting poodles to four three two one way he has said is ... ... ... and different nights in life up to knife you have a CNN maybe many lives\nIs this a reaction to the world as we know it and the needs among to prove this is to cope with reality [noise] well that's a good question\nAnd I think it's um that it's the on the playground we have way we can do that because we know we're on a trajectory that has only one ending and really it is only about one journey we\nMuch as we'd like to think ... when not going to\nHave to live as pets I should have another son just you know the which is about how to live but which is this a character he walks along the street\nHe gets knocked down by bus oh he won't slumped on the street she doesn't get run down by bus you meet the press you go and then you sort of these narratives said that they buy for Kate and the end of the anti you have\nA completely unmanageable no [laughter] I I still think about it and I still think that has to be way of writing that so yes most ... is a very attractive to rise has I think that that's you know that ... the way\nYou can just do things that you don't even live\nJust as there is something I mean I'm told it's scientifically respectable thinking the idea is that they're all multi doses as soon\nAs you know yeah we are at this moment living then you know then you know I Know I Know it's it's it's amazing it's fascinating I tell you one day we'll we'll meet with us so [laughter]\nAnd that's fascinating to another question\nFrom the ... of audience\nAnd it came time money and the the poster from nuns and I'm a huge fan of your ... especially the checks and Rudy novels and I would love each writes another one [laughter] but my question is um would you want to fly um\nMy fantasy obviously I have many ... because I keep talking about it my fantasies to have an identical twin rather than to the multiple lives because then I Would have someone who would understand me completely I thought actually I didn't really want to that in ... when I went to another me [laughter]\nThat's ... ... and I could just say the thing is just because then you'd have to ... you know you\nNeed no compromise no no shutting about things and you would use them to have that other person so that's more my ... most for lives and in in a way the good thing about being ... if you do get to explore multiple lives 'cause he likes going you know your ... all the time and I think that's\nSatisfying so maybe that keeps me quiet\nThank you very much and we have to leave it next month we're off to Beijing ... we'll be talking about ... look to us\nAnd spot by the life of her own grandmother it's a story of a young woman torn between traditional ... cells in the so called city of sin\nIf you a question for ... off of the program off the thoughts of the satirical ... couldn't Chong about his book the ... is then due to all of it by the fifteenth of well over ... very far off\nTo contact those are the send an email or tweet toss up BBC W.

because the lay of the land had been clear all ready for a more than twenty four hours before the vote we knew\nHow it was going to go but it's clear example of how bitterly divided the Senate is and has become really over the protests of the nomination the Democrats opposed it from the beginning they did so because they didn't agree with Brett Kavanaugh's ideology or his jurisprudence but then it became mixed up with these allegations of sexual misconduct\nIt was alleged that he had a an attempted rape and his past when he was a high school student and then also the way that he responded to that to what they became questions about his temperament and his character\nAnd so by the time he came to the Senate floor of the two sides were even further apart than they had been when they started um and I think that that will probably have a a lasting impact on the Senate\nClearly this is a huge win for Donald Trump but to a victory that's clearly highly controversial\nYes and and we'll probably have an impact beyond a vet Kavanaugh taking his seat on the Supreme Court\nBench at first of all with the court itself eating some of the judges on the bench had expressed some reservation about the protests surrounding this I'm worrying that it it sort of had this very part is an cue\nAnd wondering whether that would lead over into the court itself because it's very important for the Supreme Court to be seen as impartial uh of course that's the strength of its legitimacy so there is that element of it is also a question of\nHow the Senate is uh is working on the the process of nominating judges has always been contentious but this one particularly so\nUm and exposing these these really deep divide wondering whether those kinds of things can be bridged for the Senate to work

the\nPassions if the me too movement they felt that the\n... alleged victim of judge Kavanaugh the woman who came forward with these allegations that he had tried to rape or when they were in high school that her voice hadn't been taking seriously the investigation hadn't been serious enough and\nThere is a lot more willingness of women to come out and say those things and demand that they'd be

intense debate and allegations of sexual misconduct which judge Kavanaugh ... denies it ensures that the court now has the conservative majority and many Democrats remain bitterly opposed his the senior Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer speaking during the debate\nWhen the history of the Senate has written this chapter will be a flashing red warning light\nOf what to avoid truly judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a low moment for the Senate for the court for the country\nWhere President Trump speaking at a rally in Kansas said it was a great day for America\nI before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our\nAnd I want to thank our in front of a Republican senators for refusing\nWell I also Washington corresponded bumper plan our show how this controversial episode reached its conclusion\nWhen it didn't do so peacefully because there were protesters outside the Capitol Hill and Supreme Court in a few of them got into the Senate chamber where the boat to face\nA bat at that went through an fairly quickly wants all the senators had had their chance to say their minds which took place over thirty hour period from friday and Saturday\nAnd it was able to happen because it was very much along party lines were number of senators who are wavering up until the last minute who could have turned that vote either way and they all declared well ahead of time so it was clear that that that Kavanaugh\nHad the math but then that is the math of the votes but it was very sharply divided has probably the closest vote on the Supreme Court nominee and more than a hundred years\nWhat does this now due to the balance of the Supreme Court\nThis means that the Supreme Court is going to have a conservative majority\nSolid conservative majority and probably will do for decades because at judges get lifetime positions Brett Kavanaugh is replacing a conservative judge but that judge what's a swing vote sometimes he sided with liberals\nAnd having a is not going to do that he has a very strong record of conservative positions on all of the issues that are expected to come up in front of the Supreme Court\nSo that means that over time an evolutionary sort of way we can expect to the Supreme Court\nTo take conservative positions on many social and other issues that come before it\nAnd when you talk about those issues and how they come up I mean how far into the future are we looking when we start to see possible change yeah\nWell I Can't say precise neat but for example I'll give you an example there was some concern\nA lot of concern I should say on that I'm from Democrats and and social liberals that\nMr Kavanaugh's nomination would put at risk women's abortion rights in particular that now that groundbreaking decision called roe versus Wade which made abortion legal throughout the country he's ascending to the banks are he's taking a seat on the Supreme Court is very unlikely\nTo do something dramatic is overturned that but there will be decisions coming up in states more rights to take decisions that would make it more difficult\nFor women to have abortions and so I think you could see for example that right being chipped away we wrote it depending on where you live in the country that is an example of something that you might see\nPresident Trump is obviously pleased about this outcome because this man was very much he's nomination but does it mean mole for him than just the fact that these men who go through\nOh yes it absolutely does it's probably\nHis top political victory or at least among the top political victories that he's had since he took office he\nPromised his voters that he would appoint conservative judges to the bench this is his second one\nAnd and you know this was a very important promise to many of those who voted for many of those who actually held their nose and voted for him because they didn't like much of what he stood for but this was so important to them that they went along with it and now he has been able to deliver in less than two years into his term so this is an incredibly important victory for him and it's happened just about\nA month before mid term elections that are turning out to be\nHotly contested and that is also something that's useful for him he'll be using distant campaigning before the election\n... in Washington\n[noise] maybe one hundred and fifty

the judge denies it ensures that the court now has a conservative majority many Democrats remain bitterly opposed to what's happened is the senior Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer speaking during the debate\nWhen the history of the Senate has written this chapter will be a flashing red warning light\nOf what to avoid truly judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a low moment for the Senate for the court for the country\nWhere President Trump speaking at a rally in Kansas said it was a great day for America\nI said before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our\nAnd I want to thank our in front of a Republican senators for refusing\n[noise]\nWell the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes just weeks before the U.S midterm elections where the Democrats are hoping to make gains in the house of representatives as well as the Senate we can speak to caffeine frankly she's a leading expert in public opinion polling in the United states or caffeine welcome good morning\n[laughter] well good evening evening to me I didn't want to use money from us and Britain tell us whether this capital issue have had any bearing on the ... to ... as far as you can tell\nWell it it seems to have in the last three weeks opinion if Kavanaugh himself has actually declined as the stories are potential sexual abuse and sexual harassment as grew so he's been confirmed\nMore Americans think he should not have been confirmed and think he does how ever what has happened that is seems to be important in looking to the mid term elections is that there are Republicans who have now become much more enthusiastic about casting a vote\nThe the thing this this fall is is that there's ... everything in the house of representatives is is up ... ...\n... we're looking very good very poised to take over thirty five seats in the Senate are up that the third of the total number most of them are held by Democrats which makes it very difficult to force them to take control of the Senate they were hopeful because in previous being\nMuch more likely to say they weren't city asked about voting this fall then Republicans were Republicans now thinks that they have an issue but\nI Will raise Republican enthusiasm and in fact in a lot in the economist Hugo pools in the last week the percentage of Republican met and in particular does he I think about voting this year than usual Rosa eleven points looted from a large change\nIn a very short period of time uh Democrats have been enthusiastic Democrats have been I'm ed ... turning out in um special elections and in primary elections and\nAnd so now and I think we have a little a week or two of uneasiness we really do have to wait another week or so to see it\nAs this rare moments continues um oh

I'm going to get into one I'm going to last for a moment while I get some comments from the studio and also because the line is a little shaky between you and I was I'm Sylvia when you look at how this might kind of ... ... what comes to mind\nFor research to our surprise to hear the ah the events motivated the Republicans mostly\nA as we know Americans usually don't show up in hard numbers for electric generically and the Democrats more motivated and then the Republicans but now it seems that this is motivated the Republicans\nWhich means I Would think that they will go towards a more conservative\nView in the mid term elections than we were expecting from previous reports and and as a special is just mention it looks like the Democrats will probably take over the house of representatives but in their little ground in the in the Senate\nOr the Russia [noise] yeah I tend to\nAgree actually with a some analysis um [noise] I think that uh that I'm Tom is winning more and more name the heart of them ... which is something that was not the case then beginning\nYou got because of the economic figures he can well I think the economic\nFingers are very important because we have precedent to all with benefits from an economic uh up to an end for sure\nThe U.S economy is doing they will now be tempted to it of course I mean this is an economic cyber lung 'cause I knew who was actually Obama this thought that it is and you know Tom is reaping the benefits but that's you know what this happened\nLet me let me go back to catching a duty but we'll have a better line of you you have the remarks caffeine in the studio pick up on on any points you heard\n[noise] I I think my point that's very important\nTo make is that opinion about Donald Trump seems on changing and he has stabilized at an approval rating that's around forty percent it goes up a point or two it goes down to one or two he is benefiting from what is a very good economy I'm just yesterday\nIn fact\nThe unemployment rate was that we've seen in the United states since Nineteen sixty nine so that's that's helping him\nOn I think the problem in looking ahead to the uh the election which is thirty days away it's quite a ways away locks can happen lots has been happening in the United states [laughter] um but I think the problem is that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections\nAnd um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats um it is a is going to be a state by state results um it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats take control of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIs it a little sort of ... to ... the Democrats are clearly against something most of the sea Donald Trump put people are less clear about what their full\n[laughter] I I Do think that that's a very good point because\nIt seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear than it is to motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician intends to when\nI'm what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump's they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme Court\nRepublicans have one that fits conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority there um and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican and Susan ... as a ... to\nThe people have both near as voting in an actions object campaign muck by widespread intimidation and ethnically things to be at least two candidates for the rotating presidency and seeking secession or ethnic autonomy highlighting Bosnians continuing facility\nThat's tight security income or ruined for its presidential election violence has escalated in recent weeks well fishes in Haiti say these ten people have been killed in an earthquake that ticket panic in the north of the country ...

Florida Kelly tells me Harkin was the first stone she survived in fact she's a bit to the veteran\nI moved to Florida in two thousand and three\nAnd in two thousand four there were three hurricanes that year Charlie Francis and Jean Charlie was the one that change course and you didn't have a chance to evacuate yes and we lived in an apartment on the floor apartment\nMen and the high\nPassed right over us and even though it had been in for a long time it was still\nNinety mile an hour winds we went in the master bedroom closet with the cat and we waited it out and it was almost done and power went out\nAnd it was two days is hot and wet when Charlie went through it was like\nIt was a bomb that only took out trees there wasn't\nCanopy a\nOn a gas station that wasn't torn off\nKennedy do you have to get used to hurricanes you don't get used to which really but you learn to live with that anxiety nine times out of ten everything's going to be fine but it's that one time that you have to be prepared for and ready to act on\nIf there's one place getting back to being prepared it's Florida\nUm surprisingly for the state's dumped the hurricane capsule of the world there's a lot of research happening hit into how they work and how to mitigate their effects\nAnd as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we could stop harkens altogether but before that I Want to start with some basics wants a hurricane and how does it home why there's so many of them have and the ... the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us all that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nThey told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment her for the international university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up

true\nMeteorologists always talk about her butterfly flaps its wings at all can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nSteven admits his plan would be expensive they hundred ships would cost about four hundred million dollars but considering Catholic refined harkens can cost a hundred billion dollars to clean up it seems like a good deal\nStudents so ... isn't the only scientist with a plan to cool ... back in Miami we caught up in other New York based Isaac Guinness\nThe idea is very similar to what the ... does\nNature when the Huntington drives whether strong car and they bring the cold\nWater from that to the surface if we would use of the official upper willing generated by this way of driven pumps Goldwater is brought to the surface then it's mixed is with the warm so now the water and the result is the cooling of the sources by about\nTwo degrees or so according to my estimation\nDoesn't Cold War to just sit back down again when you bring up like because it's heavier than will\nMove from this is an excellent question that's the first question and I asked myself tons of not so Goldwater wrote to the surface would mix with a warm water and will stay within thirty forty meters\nIsaac says his idea is purely theoretical for now he's punch the numbers and one company did come off the coast of the meat it to see if they work but he says you need a grid of them and obviously no one's actually tested this in real life conditions\nI think probably the best approach would be to deploy those bombs right in front of the holidays so you live life enough with a flexible tubes that can be replicated deployed maybe twenty four hours in advance of or because of all evil\nOr what kind of effect you expecting the will to cling to have on this hurricane\nThe estimates should I have a show that we could use the intensity of by the ... one category both roughly ten percent\nChanging a cat degree food to catch re three may not sound like a great results for the exit the only six says it could cause a third less damage he pitches this system of passive pumps being dragged out and placed in the sea and the costs of extreme looking harkens\nThese pumps really known plastic tubes with a boy at the top ... at the base and a series of vowels allow the cold water from a couple of hundred meters down to rise up which\nWe're not talking about placing this bombs in the permanent locations but rather\nYou their life enough with a flexible tubes that can be represented deployed than I was thinking about maybe twenty four hours in advance of what it comes to that article and our track forecasts steel is quite close these days though we can do quite well wherever hardly Kim is going on we can deploy\nThis massive number of wife bombs in front of the story of\nHow many pumps you reckon you need to deploy in the in the path of any particular hurricane and\nHow wide an area are you talking about\nAn estimated ... to cover a region of roughly a hundred and fifty kilometers by ... used to joke about what those are the palm so not for every three hundred meters will say wait a little bit more so it will be young hundred fifty thousand us a hundred and ... pumps\nYeah I'd found the perfect time of course but if what you could put this bombs on a large part just maybe a thousand on no one barge they censor the could be deployed very efficiently maybe by ten boats in front of the storm these\nBig geo engineering projects and they're always consequences when you try and modify something like a weather system you worried about what\nWe know the ... approaching the lab would die anyway so what we're proposing is that we can nudge before the gym before them for all the stuff we coming tumor it's really not like a weather

might not leave so results of course I Am personally strongly in favor of better ...\nBut the thing the big disasters is unavoidable especially with the climate change\nAnd warming the ocean we know the ... will get more intense in the future\nAnd also because more people\nAre moving to coastal areas so we're increasingly more vulnerable in my view we should definitely be thinking about this and we'll start with a small scale tests immolation some more radical start this and I just think that this common sense\nNo as surely ... shed some ideas for stopping harkens the top just common sense\nUh some of them I Would fare far fetched for example let's break a piece of an iceberg and put it in the Gulf of Mexico or down here in the Caribbean and cool the sea surface temperatures\nAh we've had people that suggest something like a bomb or an explosive and to see if that will dissipate the hurricane and not make it form will we ever be able to stop the hurricane or at least tied to punch out of it\nOh don't we all wish we could stop hurricanes\nUnfortunately there are here to stay\nActually for some areas in the world hurricanes are typhoons they're actually helpful for communities to bring a water or or refresh lakes or things like that or in the U.S and Gulf of Mexico they help to kind of cleanse the estuaries that we have\nSo they are helpful and it says they do create a lot of damage and so what we've learned to do and what people should do is to learn how to live with them and adapt to them these are things that are always gonna be it's how Mother Nature balances itself [noise]\n\nProblem with taking on a hurricane is all the options of big ideas that need the big money to come to fruition [noise] one of the issues is that none of these ideas without

J. did have notification from its standard seismic network and they were able to identify the epicenter of the earthquake and the magnitude of the earthquake what they did not have\nWas data regarding the change in the water column that would indicate his anatomy\nThey also had tied gauges but the tide gauges were regular tied gauges that catch the incoming tied in the morning and the outgoing tied in the evening\nBut they were set for every Fifteen minutes so they did not and they're also observation oh you can see the wave actually almost at the same time that the tide gauges can be in\nIndonesia does have global positioning insistence that I Believe there was the only one about two hundred\nKilometers away from the epicenter that would not have covered the area so in fact what being cagey did not have was any measurement for the change in the water column that would indicate us in a\nRow and that's a really important point which brings us onto the prices type that you'd be ... with other universities in Indonesia over the last few years because this was the assistant ... ocean senses on the ocean floor that that would be able to detect changes in the wool to call them and that would give some kind of indication of us in on me\nYes that's exactly what we're working on and we are very advanced in this prototype this is our last year for the project\nBut the prototype does need to be fully installed and tested before it could be approved for adoption and installation implementation and other coastal cities in Indonesia\nRight well if they find out more about the price low and so it's a system of sentences and they're able to\n... measuring pressure basically be able to tell the tax changes in the will to call them so that would be the stigma of an oncoming signal me but the really interesting here is how they communicate with each other because this is an expensive fiber optic link between the senses but robots economics has a Paul how do they communicate with each other\nWell this is a very interesting part and here are ocean engineers are taking advantage of the thermal Klein layer in\nThe ocean waters Indonesia located describe the equator\nHas warm equatorial waters and the sound actively bounces up to the surface and then re frack back down again so sound is able to carry much longer distances underwater in these equatorial waters than elsewhere\nOr just to be show the sound here is ... to be like so you're getting this really important to about water pressure and it's a waste of time trying to communicate with radio waves down there so it's included into sound and that bounces off the surface and back down to the other senses and you end up with the ...\nThat would that be right and so the electrical signals that are transmitted and sound are really transmitted from the bottom\nPressure censored to communication center that transmits it to another communication center censor say twenty thirty\nKilometers away too and now they're they call this a bellhop method and then it is picked up by a cable censor that cable to ensure station\nAnd I came from that show station up for the fact like and then eventually to the people who need to have the warning about second just very very crucial but only because we're stuck for time I wonder if you can just go on and tell us about\nHow effective do you think this would be on there was a ... at the moment it's off ... off the coast of the ... province\nBut if you can nail this price so I can get it working what difference would it make\nIt makes a huge difference because the undersea the acoustic communication is much less expensive than the surface Louise\nI'm In and also easier and safer to more secure to maintain so it would be possible for a developing countries like Indonesia to mount and maintain such a ... assume Downey detection system\nSo that professor Louis come for listening to that bill Thompson and it's\nImpressive to see how they're managing to sort of adapt the technology to to use as as you heard the sound waves in the water because of this particular federal ... properties to to be read in the same it's unfortunate that\nDo you have to pay for scientists to be some way that you need a low cost system because we can't afford to protect the lives of these people\nAnd then there was a tumble sort of I'm an international response to this which would allow ... I was either a benefit to developing technology that keeps the coast down as much as it can be but that costs seems to be one of the factors ... deployed this system\nEffectively or be proven that it was getting out so he really unfortunate and you would think that we will be able to do something as a global community it has affected us you know these rather than have each country just after ... ... systems\nOh I Know thank you very much for that what it's made volunteer fresh morning this week about the security\nOf our systems out of the voice activated gadget listen to this\n[noise]\nWell that sounds pretty normal to me but that's actually something sinister hidden within those Robyn nice sounding natural sounds imperceptibly to us\nAt least sounds could trick your voice activated personal system or maybe in the future you're driverless car because concealed within that but so was a ... to get one of the catch is how they view contact with don't eat the policy\nWhen I listened to the ... just ... type dummy code us all to new research into the realm of psycho to stick hiding started ... is professor in electrical engineering and information technology at ... university book um\nWe were interested in seeing how far\nWe can go in using the difference between human audio protection and machine audio perfection because humans of course have some limits to their\nPerceptual ability for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to perceive a very quiet town but free speech recognition system that's just the same and there's other effects like that so not only can you not hear quiet sounds after hours so\nAnd so what happens to be that in many of the different situations in life before you're ... with a hard thing you're with light and before a a car in engages you\nYou'd actually have lights that are getting illuminate you and this really gives us the context people were actually having your fabric detect those lights and basically created a in a fermented link between the car and the district and so a fabric for the self driving work\nAnd in fact I don't think we need to wait for self driving because I think uh this couldn't have safety or even in cars that are driven by you\nSay that you think Will Smith one of many uses as he sees them all the way for getting semi conductors on textiles it's really remote\nWho innovation I mean what what they're doing and she described that quite eloquently is is a very different manufacturing process\nTo she was in the past few things about ... to ... to the conduct ... into a government or you know catching something to do the ... maybe he'll be going out and she's a completely different approach you're actually making five years which heavy ...\nEven though the manufacturing stays because of the way they don't ... to ... to the food\nAnd that that allows you to stone during feud with them as the effect computers you're also he's also managing to do things which are really quite effective in terms of their ... you know they want to prove that get around some of the issues that we voted for him to post about the problems that we see with these fabrics\n... like you mentioned was a pretty fair we're going to finish on the subjects of lots of water which ... to ... ... and the huge installation in a cavernous building formerly a water storage facility for the city of ... which are schooled Aurora and it's all about the value and the power of wool to in our lives the\nLasers as a huge sound system there was senses the ... the visitors and they're hard to find lots of tech in other words wiping speaking seat Victoria press these creative director at the school for [noise]\nSay we Scott ... have blocked off by that shows that mount traveler Fleischer style and none of the age of ... works for Microsoft\nThat came out there are based on how fast is now saying our what sounds like a lot of the different light from the front range system within ...\nEverything and they said\nThat the ... on a program called touch define our average picks up people touch device or or like the ice melting\nTook it from space flight face to face to face style drowned the protests and hit them talk for\nJust under the ... the audiences will come down and under those caught for half a series that some states that are looking for that fat rich basically be the ... trip to very delicate line\nAt when they like theory or fishing or\nI Can't and like think of them and I sat in a sense for ...\n... ... and lying on the ... ... again another example of us highway ... not be able to answer dating and anything not to say\nSo people have tractors they walk around the space and it sounds almost a vest flushing the water as they do so but what do they see around them was actually going on\nSo\nIt's very very dark kitten with and it's it really is Adam ... light\n... signs of calm and it takes them on a ...

Institute for climate impact research shoe in twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three so something of a climate models starting\nAnd the scorching Russian some of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty ... twenty eleven I guess climate scientists more ... or\n... links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing changes in extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially heat

weather records to and this year I mean it's like Freddie also ought to stick to them as they happen ... outfit will with attribution examines the European heat wave fixing on seven European cities including doubling you ...\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today\nAnd so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask what what the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the climate change and then the case of doubling ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and to pretend that climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely by anthropogenic climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of over thirty degrees were busting the records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study that looked to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at we found that if a much much of it right then and the well we live and so it was in the Southern Wild than it was at least in one in Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty year then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are\nAll over the place and so you're uncertainties are much higher lives in this house climate change actually made this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the data and climate modeling this is the managing former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happening more frequently or more intense or none of the above in the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wells ... suddenly off to the finish and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen now taking shape\nWe won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the fart up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading\nThe extreme warms across Asia one study said we're not just been possible without climate change floods in central China the Mets are two hundred and fifty seven and twenty two billion dollars of damage was found to be influenced by global warming\nAnd so one of the things scientists are doing is trying to unravel how much of that is a direct influence of what we're seeing happening in the Arctic\nThis isn't just guesswork that his climate Institute out fine but then didn't ... is leading research that's revealing strong connections between changes in Arctic temperatures in the high level jet stream wins the guy with a ... as much of the northern hemisphere\nWhile we talk about the large scale circulation we talk about things like jet stream and we'll be call storm tracks so the jet stream that's written by the temperature difference between alone let that don't show up topics an awful lot to do what's the what's the Arctic so the optics of costs much colder\nTemperature difference Great Depression difference pressured their funds flush the jet stream\nThe jet stream owes its existence to that temperature contrast\nMichael Mann has been collaborating with improvement in studying how optical woman is changing the north and with our parents and\nThat's actually what creates the jet during this band a very strong winds from the west in the upper part of the atmosphere the trope a sphere that we live in those strong wins arise because of the north south contrast and temperature and if you reduce those contracts you can slow down the jet stream\nOr you can slow it down what that means that you no longer have that strong jet stream that's there to take those weather systems and move them along so they're more likely to linger\nThis is the study and we have done a couple of years ago and we showed them the debts and summer the jet stream most weekends and particular\nThese stolen threats that we can and that is important because these stone strikes up a very moderating effect on the weather conditions over declare Europe and in general over in the mid latitudes over the lens regions that the reason is nice weather systems are generated\nOver the ocean over the Atlantic and travel to which to Eastern Europe and they have relatively wet Arab either the female temperatures and therefore their according affects on continental temperatures so he sat slow it's weakening\nYou have less of that cooling effect and that favors to build up of hot and dry conditions over the confidence uh this is yeah we've seen quite pronounced changes in that's weakening of the weather systems that favors to build up a whole to dry extremes as we've seen for example this year\nBut the weakening has an even more dramatic effect because it is a slap cunning with the wind driven more slowly it's more likely to be diverted increasingly all with the full cost of our pizza show or launch we lines sneaking\nNorth south around them all home this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and in turn is dealing with in more alarming directions\nYou know in one region the jet stream most north what's ranks warm\nAir hopes of topical regions falling off that creates very warm temperatures legion slide Siberia\nAnd at the same time regions where the jet stream Ben solve what's it brings an ad for you ought to all of a self correcting relatively cold conditions so what'd you tend to see if you have to wait for the jet stream your tendency\nAlternating are normally smuggled them off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it in two thousand they do\nAnd the particular version of this wave the most amongst improvement in Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents when are these ... hike up more and more energy and become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at whether diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out and that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just\nOne particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas or around the entire northern hemisphere and that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems\nVery large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed passing the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure systems that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us and then the southeastern us where we had a tendency for that low pressure system and there was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations\nFrom a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means you it's got nowhere to go
