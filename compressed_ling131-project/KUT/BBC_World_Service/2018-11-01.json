end up obviously working in her favor she was mocked and humiliated by our president the book went against her she can as you move back to her own home so I'm I Am wondering\nI realized that women are not allowed to express anger and the way that men are but on the other hand is there a you know and another counterfactual universe where Christine Blasey Ford stands up and says you know this happened to me it's you know it's affected my life permanently and I'm outraged\nYou know what does that look like you know what ... how much worse could that be I guess I'm Wondering\nHow much time till we get there [noise]\n'cause I'm like Twenty years well that's going to melt down so [laughter]\nUm I mean in terms of what it looks like I think we can only barely imagine what it looks like I mean I I Would also encourage you to look at the way that the senators talked about the protesters long before in the weeks weeks before the assault allegations had been made public\nWhen there were protesters protesting the the nomination yelling about the repeal of health care and about the prospect of repeal of of roe v Wade and there were really tremendously admirable women in that gallery just shouting\nHolding up signs being taken out arrested and then another one would get up and shout and hold up signs and the the language that was used by the Republican members of the judiciary orange hatch said get\nThat loud mouth out of here we shouldn't have to put up with this and Ben Sasse gave a whole oratory on how for decades he's been hearing women yelling about how women are going to die if abortion is illegal and this is a really and he used the word hysteria\nRight so if that's the language loud mouth hysterics that was being deployed against the protestors we can only imagine the way that Christine Blasey Ford would have been written off by the members of the judiciary who if she had to make the impression upon right [noise]\nBut there is this other model that came out of those same days for a model of women unapologetically expressing their fury and it was the protesters and it was the women who confronted Jeff Flake in the elevator on a marine Sheila Maria Gallagher [noise]\nAnd their anger was also supposed to make an impression on Jeff Flake which it may have even though the thing that he calls where it was a total sham um\nBut it was there was something so powerful\nAbout seeing and hearing those women with their voices shaking\nScreaming pointing their fingers at this powerful men and the ... part of the demand that they were making was me me and the I look at me in the eye\nWe are demanding that you listen to us and that you see a and that you don't pretend that our anger doesn't exist and that anger which Christine Blasey Ford could never have voiced anything like that given the context in which she was speaking if she\nIf she hoped to be taken seriously and not hold off my authority\nBut those women's anger was deployed in a way that I think as powerful and again communicative and connective tissue masses of women who felt like those women were were speaking for them\nAnd confronting someone in power and forcing that person in power to look and to listen and to respond and I think that's a model moving forward that we should remember I I bet\nThat decades from now that elevator confrontation will be cited as having been catalytic and communicative leak crucial to the building\nAnd what what I Hope will become the coalition building that will continue at will need to continue because we are looking at the rest of our lives everyone in this room\nThis is not something that's going to be six in four weeks [noise] this is not something that's going to be fixed and twenty twenty or twenty twenty four ... is now the rest of our lives\nAnd we have to figure out how to take the anger that we are feeling and you use it to change the country and there are there are centuries generations of people who have come before us who have had the same project ahead of them and who have given their lives\nTo trying to make this country better and we rather than be depressed by this I Am inspired\nBy the idea that there were
