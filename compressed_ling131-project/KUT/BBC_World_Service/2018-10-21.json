so\nI'm Still am Bailey and I'm a political reporter here at the Courier Journal I'm a child of eighties I was born in Nineteen eighty four and\nI remember the just say no movement you know the Reagan Era and I was taught both at home and in the school system and from those public service announcements that drug addicts were just as much a part of the problem is drug dealers right there was a demonization of drug abusers\nWith this current crisis opioid crisis more and more of your users will abuse that with drugs are white and now it's not seen as a criminal issue it's seen as a health issue it's not a matter what would you lock these people up and throw it away for twenty three years we get them into treatment\nAnd that shifted in large part parallel to the shifting the demographics of the people who are being affected by the drug it went from urban America black America Hispanic America and now it shifted from your urban areas into your suburbs\nInterior rural parts of the country so with that there was a lot more bipartisan agreement\nRepublicans and Democrats agree that we need to do something about the opioid crisis republic they'll step away from the beach to be compassionate\nSympathetic arm to these policies that deal with people who have these addictions and that's\nCertainly different than how it was treated twenty Thirty years ago so that's been to me the most interesting political change in switch over is that now and you see even the media the stories of farmers who but its toll from the old\nBut we can't help themselves when like sit back in the seventies and eighties it was no you have a moral failing and that's why you were to these drugs we need to be held responsible for that for the most part that's not the monster anymore\nBidding I Am

of the countries the western countries if you will shed respond but my sense is that\nWe collectively need to figure out a way to do that and that that entails conversations between us we all have some or\nIf you will and trust in Saudi Arabia I don't know that I can give you a specific answer I Know that uh I'm committed to working with their state pomp ... and others\nTo figure out people on the other side of the Senate to figure out the appropriate way forward and we need to be thoughtful about it I mean we need to\nWe need to realize that uh you know Saudi Arabia is a very unusual place none of us have a lot of insight into who the next later might\nBe if in fact NBS is not the later so this is one of those things where none of us need to react with pure emotion\nWe need to think this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way but look I I Would think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do you think western ... perhaps too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man and a\nWrong to believe that he was a reformist you know\nYou sit with him he has a very impressive

Raja unreal something when it's a six five even thirty six GMT as we are produced some sounds from London\nYesterday [noise]\n\nA few of an estimated half a million people\nWho marched through London on Saturday to demand a vote on Britain's eventual deal I'm leaving the European Union the demonstration was organized by people's votes that's a group opposed to breakfast to protest comes at a time when negotiations between London and Brussels on Britain's departure\nAppear to have reached an I'm past the prime minister Theresa May is facing pressure from MPs you want the country to maintain close ties with you and those who are seeking a hot a break from the blog Simon Jones joined the crowds on Saturday walking down London's possibly [noise]\nThey've come from all parts of the u._k. to march you know the ... in that belief that there needs to be a new referendum but with many different views on how they feel bricks it would affect\n[noise] young pass and I don't walk in the European Union that Korea and my opinion I mean many clay\nAnd I want to be talking about how they do that when I called them back and rode on gun how countries I think it's going to get into\nI'm Frank living in Germany I came today especially for that\nAnd I'm proud to report hold a British people that we all European the referendum that coated with the a choice between any deal that degree with Russell who deal if it comes to that thing in the ... you change McCrory is one of the organizers of the so called malt for the future\nWhen people say well we've had a referendum we feed another war what are you saying the la vie for the mastery of\nThe ... say they won't\nThey say that you wouldn't buy a house without checking things without having to do come to the ... why when you talk about the biggest the advertising that me and my thoughts on what you have a good looking on the market [noise]\nThe pilots featured for the mayor of London and peaceful policies celebrities that urging everyone attending to contact their and peace to say they won't be forgiven if about Britain say [noise]\nSome insurance with some of the sounds from the streets of London that political correspondent Rob Watson was at the ... give us a sense of the day Robb if you can\nWell it is absolutely massive massive massive crowd I think much larger than expected on good morning through to enroll someone die they both made you know what I Want to what I wanted to do I should say uh for the listeners what else is just to Chuck Chuck massive grenade and at the beginning of our conversation\nYou got to sort of sense of some of the ... I Do think that Britain as in the middle of a real crisis because what you've heard that as evidence of the extraordinary passion division sort of poison the breakfast is ... ... in to to operate Britain was a divide that there is\nThat you've also got a governing conservative policy that's just implode Brexit you have a main opposition labor policy but it's not seen as a credible governments\nYou've got businesses now profoundly worried about what Brexit light may ... says of a breakdown in the talks between the u._k. and you are I think uh uh getting higher so I'm Sorry to be so obsolete leaving really does seem to me\nThat that were in that we all really in a crisis it may not feel like that a lot of old people but you take that sort of now I guess I describe it as the sort of the poison in division ... district in this country like nothing else I have seen in sociology is this\nAnd also as you say I'm really glad we had you on the sorry state universities\nWhen you look at opinion polls do you see any significant shift in public opinion on\nThis well you know I'm not a pollster but I guess what has happened is this sort of settled down to the if you think about it to ... leave beat remain by almost ... percent yet the polls have settled into sugar pretty consistent lead about seven percent of people do not think that it was the wrong decision\nTo vote to leave the European Union but here's the thing\nI think a lot of people in this much yesterday but what I understand that's what I think that hasn't quite what hasn't been yet as some massive decisive a public shift against Brecht said I mean it's true that the opinion polls\nConsistently suggests that most people say that the government is amazing thing making the most ... that they are in a shambles as a social with of chaos\nAnd I spoke to him earlier this week\nI think the Republican Party has essentially sold out eighty to Ninety percent of what it used to believe in and they're no longer has any real principals beyond devotion to Donald Trump and whatever he says or does\nWhat do you point to by way of policies or principals or beliefs which you say all written that eighty to Ninety percent bracket\nI think it varies a lot of Republicans will point to the fact that he has cut taxes or cutting taxes didn't they\nThey do like cutting taxes but they also used to believe in fiscal discipline and Trump and the Republicans now are piling up trillion dollar deficits during an economic expansion which has a very bad idea and they also focus on the judges that's probably the biggest selling point for conservatives\nBut Trump has appointed Gorsuch and Calvin on a bunch of lower court\nJudges who they think will push their agenda through the courts and then they tend to ignore everything else including the high tariffs the assault on the rule of law the unethical conduct an office of the quite possibly the illegality committed by the president\nOr the way that he demeans into base was the office every single day\nThe way that he insults our allies\nAnd ... towards brutal dictators around the world a lot of what he does but I find so objectionable is actually part of the appeal for a lot of Republicans the fact that he engages in racist massage and this rhetoric an action\nAnd I wanted to delve into that 'cause it's a very long list of challenges and clearly a lot of people listening who are supporters of Donald Trump would argue with each and every one of them and the charge they might level of you who\nIs that they ... to an extent sour grapes you were part of the policy which is now chosen a different route it's not your roots and therefore you'll cheese do about it\nWell that's true I think they have chosen and their moral and ethical and repugnant rude and I am quote unquote she's off about it\nI root for the game support is the\nPoint is I mean I could have taken this journey with the Republican Party to I mean so many of my old friends who once were appalled that Donald Trump have now become eager supporters I could have done the same thing that would have been the path of least resistance\nLay in aside from within that's another option isn't it\nThat is another option and and I do have a few friends although in a decreasing number who are still principle never Trump present are in the Republican Party fighting for their principles but I saw that early on that it was a losing battle after Donald Trump won the presidency of\nPersonal one if I'm able to like to leave a political party that you've been a puddle for so long I mean how ... does that become one it's a difficult\nProcess no question about it I mean the falling out with friends or having to reorient myself in the world I mean I was a member not just the way political party but of a political tribe and that's really what what the political parties are un American it's startling to see that people change religions more often than they change political parties\nDo you consider yourself now to be a new policy personal view swung as far as now saying you'd ... Democrat\nI'm not affiliated with any party at the moment but I Am saying that everybody should vote democratic in November because I think it is imperative to have a check and balance on Donald Trump but I think there is a real issue going forward for twenty twenty\nOne of the Democratic party stand for I I for one would love to see the Democratic party moved to the center and capture the allegiance of a lot of independent voters like me and former Republican like me\nAnd what would moving to the center mean in practical terms in policy terms and I'm thinking particularly in foreign policy terms which we haven't talked about yet but I Know it's an area of particular interest\nOf ... ... what would the send to ground meat in foreign policy terms for you\nAnd foreign policy I think it would mean reaffirming our alliances stopped trashing NATO stopped trashing the you stop complaining about American troop deployments\nAnd just one final point about the Republican Party going perhaps a little further back in time than just since Donald Trump became president because that's what you've looked into in your book\nAnd I'm assuming that you have shifted politically not just because of Donald Trump what he stands for but what he does have be fair to say that it's because of some of the things that you have found out about the Republican Party and its recent past as a result of delving into it\nThat's absolutely true I ... and the corrosion of conservatism I chronicle my awakening to the Republican Party and the conservative movements dark side which\nWas there all along but I was blind to it essentially because I was part of the tribe and now looking back at the history with with a clear eyed assessment I realized\nOh my goodness the Republican Party has been a catering to racism or for a long time it has become increasingly marred by by ignorance buy an assault on science\nBy a a pandering to to prejudice all these uh critiques that liberals have been making all along that I thought were just ... on the good name of the Republican Party the election of Donald Trump made me realize wait a second this is accurate this is true\nMax Boot to as you head has now left the right I'm telling you what do you make of that\nWell look I think the heat the current heroes of Donald Trump does make me nostalgic for a time when conservatism meant something there was an ideology behind the politics as as as a particular tribe\nAnd what worries me is that not only has that are sort of distinct lack of any coherent ideology behind what say for example the policy actions of Donald Trump ... dismantling of the very institutions that have supported supposed sensitive so I'm a keep democracy ... top ... and that's deeply worrying\nBut the Max Boot argument without disparaging seemed to be to go back to something that's been tried before and the voters have rejected\nWell voted the rejecting all sorts of institutions and I think that's where the power of populist like Trump or live in the sense that they say look you're frustrated with the lack of you know how how this institution isn't working that come on board but what they now get is that is a sort of flattery of of\nOf of Twitter generated policymaking rather than something that's actually kind of ... based on on ideology\nRight now the things I find ... because you know and they eat pay we might be looking and some people actually pay a price for that she has happened when we might\nHe's a red lining of all political policies but one thing that is forgotten and not when you know Janice that take that it is quite how tribal people who are members of policy I'm particularly over the ... and and represents that\nThe case you do fail ... crowd and it's not what one things where the that was so interesting how difficult it is slave relieving friends but you're also leaving something you've invested so much time and um but I Do think there's something really to be set for people who are willing to look at the evidence and I'm over in right now\nAnd say I would change my position and I and I have a lot of respect that I think where\nWe can be very cruel people change their mind and I think that should we it's something we need a lot more generally in our politics\nAre my guests today Donnie ... kind of Roger ... uh when if you if you'd like to hear your thoughts on because you can go to the will to his Facebook page put people to come from them in the next to our house you're listening to weekend from the b._b._c.

be from the Turkish official first raise the along\nThe exact date for for ... pm and I was ... on on ... and where the action was asking how\nPresident Trump says the United states will withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia [noise]\nWhat's the alternative miss whoa the publishers the bizarre and be outraged\nHow much I Love I Love\nTo get this morning a roast them over and over so many times have done it was kind of Roger Journal of civic\nHere on weekends off to the\n\nAllowed and we're not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement I go out and the weapons that were not allowed to wear the ones that have said in a very human and we bonded with Russia is not very much so we're going to germinate they were going to pull out\nOf Russia has denied us claims that it's broken the agreement Jeffrey Lewis is the founder\nOf the arms control ... dot com blog on his on the line from California would first Geoffrey if we can about this treaty and watch it specifically was designed to do\n[noise] [noise] well it's a very\nImportant nuclear arms control treaty from the Nineteen eighty [noise] um if people were alive a back then they may remember the euro missile crisis a very\nSerious crisis in which the Soviet Union was deploying nuclear weapons what we call intermediate range basically nuclear weapons that could be stationed in the Soviet Union but could strike targets in Western Europe the United states was going to deploy missiles have similar range and they were going to the United states is going to put these us route [noise]\nWestern Europe or it triggered an enormous political crisis uh within NATO or\n... and really that the Soviet Union and in the end uh in Nineteen eighty seven United States and Soviet Union agreed to scrap all these weapons and so it was a it was a landmark arms control agreement that really was the first sign that the Cold War was coming to an end\nOf this mess is a regular on global food scientists as you say um the the biggest American concern as I understand it relates to innovate to ground based missile which the Americans have argued for nearly four years ... has violated the INS range restrictions that will there that's why they're angry with the Russians do they have a point about that\n\n[noise] yeah I think they do you know the a Trump Administration has made some information about the system available but I think we're all we're all waiting for more details but it does seem very likely\nUm is that what the Russians have done is they've gone ahead and deployed a cruise missile a which has a range that is a you know enough that it should be prohibited by the treaty uh and when the U.S has tried to address that issue with the Russians you know generally speaking they've sort of make\nCounter accusations by us files and um so you know I think the United states probably has a point that there is a serious violation going on um although I I I certainly wouldn't of ah wouldn't have taken a step in and out today\nRight why not I mean what are your fears as a result of what he has said [noise]\nWell you know [noise] the the reality is that [noise]\nUm the reason that the two parties negotiated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty was because these weapons are extremely ... and you know they have\nThey have very short flight time since the Soviets were extremely worried that if the west deployed these weapons that they'd be able to what was called decapitated or the ... will be leadership you know basically assassinate the leadership with nuclear weapons and\nSo it really really generated a lot of tension and a lot of a lot of concern that things had to be on very high rates of alert or to guard against a sneak attack so\n[noise] you know if we're heading back into that world or if we're going back um I can understand the kind of simplistic idea that if if the right\nTo have the capabilities we want the other team I think we've all kind of lost sight of the fact that when both sides had these capabilities we we all looked around and thought this is crazy we really shouldn't do this [noise]\nJeffrey I'm going to end the conversation to appreciate your time because the line is a little bit dicey but who knows when you but thank you very much for coming on Jeffrey Lewis from arms control ... dot com that sees blog I'm Donny would noting towards the end of that conversation with regards to what he was recording from yes\nYeah that's right look much of human progress in recent decades has been about creating a rules based international law order and\nOne of the things that I Am so very clearly at the United nations just a few weeks ago is that never has that system being under pressure inside inside many friends I mean this is an example of a bilateral treaty but when you look at the the dismantling of multilateral known and conventions and the lights in disregard\nWe're entering a very dark and dangerous the root of human\nHistory fussing the tree is violating an agreement isn't it an incumbent on you ultimately as the other signatory to say well if you don't meet is we're out\nTrue but look imagine all of the weeks months years spent in preparing that document dismantling it with with almost no negotiations it seems um seems rather counter productive and potentially dangerous\nWorld of one of the problems of covering ... generally I mean I still I still some methane they saw science hanging putting on twitching saying how important is this is someone who is the next ... makes it very very important in\nThe departments and you can even say quick end that it doesn't get the attention it just as a means quite as ... they\nWill be on to the next thing and we wind up still well how what are the knock on effect so that's how does this all play out and that's what's really worries me at the moment and that'll when they say that to deliberate tactic of coal is of course I mean it's it's ... ... just as having control listeners and in fact powerful on\nSixty minutes bus yeah and I was we heard on weekend yesterday\nIt has been confirmed by the Saudi authorities at the dissident journalist ... is dead they said that a fistfight started after he went into the Saudi comes she lives in Istanbul adding that they're being a series of arrests and ... and the kingdom following that incident\nSpeaking to reporters in Nevada President Trump was asked if he was satisfied with the response from Riyadh\nOh I'm not satisfied or do we find the answer but it was a big first that was a good first step but I Want to get to the end\nOr yes in ... is a chief advisor to the Turkish president rich have type one was a close friend of ...\nMust act was also the person that Mr ... off he's voicing fiance took telephone if he didn't reemerge from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the second of October and he's been speaking to my colleague Julian ...\nIt was exact date for for ... and I was ... it was an unknown number and by the phone\nOn a on voice very worried and ready acts who was asking how ... of course who is this and she said I Am defined seals Jamal ... he entered the confidence five hours to go he I haven't left the confident and I am very very worried\nBecause before he entered the costs so that he told me that if anything grown at or anything on expected things happen\nIs called young enough that and of course I was a surprise to hold these and I tried to understand what's happening I quote from that but I'm from ... out of you who knew him ready right I said that the you know democracy she had um the conflict and he hasn't yet\nThey were really worried that he spraying very shocked they said the recall leading up to ... than just for him because he's being\nCriticized by the Saudi Government they are seeking for him\nThey said do whatever you can do you ah ... the chief ... or ... and you can do many things and then I mean the growth the phone and I called the ... center of turkey and also I called the ... the president\nI mean at one point Mr tight to fair the west did do fair that came out ... G was not going to come out to update consulate that um something could happen to him\nI was worried not because he will be achieved in the conflict that's something that's unexpected and and I think we'll think these which would be impossible from my imagination all the confidence of international relations cost you a conversation and then the conversation on and on the mall cycle\nTalking about the possibility all sold out in the gym making some kidnapped pink or arresting people abroad when it comes to turkey she said it almost impossible to believe in Turkey because Minnesota is being\nMuch much attention much significance but it's a relationship with turkey because they have very good traditions and they don't want to put it in to risk he were feeding himself safe for even into cheat and he's she was not because he didn't care about his fish was\nTo be kidnapped or get arrested them being sent to so that yeah\n[noise] so what do you think happened to Jamal ... inside the Saudi ... that\nThe big cities almost complete the as soon as he enters the coast so they know the short time he has been kicked I think those explanations that's made by so you go and that was it that if he's a fight or something like is impossible of course it did on constantly and sing clay because\nFifteen guys on the sea Mexico she fights\nIt has been lynched I think they came intending ... to ...\nAnd ... he's bloody and they're not that much because I was talking about some detainees ... example of the just waiting for him outside and if something is wrong track them showed him for me or somebody has\nTechie promised to reveal every detail about the killing of to mouth shut gee what does it mean by that is it going to make the audio and video evidence\nOf his ... which is said to exist as he can make that more generally available make it available perhaps to foreign governments\nHundreds of Central American migrants have managed to end to Mexico from Guatemala defined by the authorities that prevent them from continuing that Jenny towards the United states many others mostly women and children and then taken back to hunt us\nDespite of this information on social media during Brazil's president selection campaign has that federal police to open an investigation it's All right ... ... to support his have denied accusations that they used a messaging app to spread fake knees\nIsrael's defense minister Avigdor Lieberman has ordered the reopening as a key border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip closed on Wednesday after a rocket attack\nIs all fake said the decision was taken because of a decrease in violent among the separation barrier following efforts by the minutes and ... to restrain Palestinian demonstrators\nAnd go to that says about three hundred and eighty thousand ... ... ... ... legal migrants have left the country in recent weeks he\nSays this flight from a campaign against unauthorized diamond mining\nHurricane Michael which back in the south eastern seaboard of the United states last week has completely X ray several nineteenth century shipwreck on the case at Florida they largely been buried in the sense that the night shift BBC nice\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the b._b._c. World Service so I'm Judy and more it could with weekend with me throughout the program Rosa ... news reporter at the Sunday Times newspaper and done these kinds of Roger secretary general civic posts a Johannesburg based on brother organization varies civil society groups\nTo Australia and now they're defeated Australia's rice you've sent a liberal policy in a bi election means if they have no last they one seat majority in parliament and we'll have to rely on the support of independent and peas\nBut the defeat also raises questions over its ability to carry on with the controversial policy of confining asylum seekers on the Pacific audience of ... among us there's\nBeen growing pressure on the government from politicians and aid organizations to come up with a way to improve the conditions of the sun MC 'cause being kept in those ... often for months or even years\nAmid reports of self home and suicides some say that might be one of the reasons why the government does raise the possibility of allowing the asylum seekers to settle in New Zealand with one condition they have to agree never to set foot in Australia in their lives so is that\nPossible we'll plausible will look\nOn the line to discuss it to to get that we've done in rose up And Julian ... law professor at University of Melbourne and former president of the Australian human rights commission\nJulian welcome to the program thank you very much\nAnd the governor as governor of mine who's an MP in New Zealand or he was ... as a child and then became the first refugee elect to two new Zealand's\nParliament but they'll raise welcome thank you good to have you on the program I'm can we start dealing with the practicalities of the ... is it possible to do as well I just described\nWell um it's probably for practical purposes got to be very difficult trade ... so the as we all know with\nDigital computers is it possible ... maintain surveillance says people end and possibly to prevent someone ever returning\nA badge and to aids guy to be a difficult thing to achieve that possible but they ... the other point that needs to be understood is that this proposed ban uh it would actually have an effect ... widely than those\nA hundred and fifty on a on the roof man is a that could affect all those who have arrived in Australia since twenty third chain as so cold ... unauthorized maritime arrivals um so the we now have\n... the wicked problem of trying to decide whether the government should how are they allowed to hold the hostages that the children as hostage and they found it costs a to this proposal for a band that would affect a hundreds and possibly thousands of other people I it's a very difficult to\nI mean there is free movement is in between New Zealand Australia\nWell that is that it's precisely that posts economic relations agreement that allows treatment\nThat has created in in a way the problem because if an asylum seeker ... a refugee which will be settled in another country they would ... some form that these are noted come back to Australia which would be a mechanism ... not safe for blocking that retention is that what the government wants to do that with New Zealand there is a writes\nA of all New Zealand does to uh to to free movement into Australia said that his batting pop the reason why this ban is seen as a ... because they straightened government does not want anybody who's being removed from Madison never even had the opportunity to settle a straight it's gotten the policy from the very\nTitle so don't ... got 'em and what does that therefore mean the New Zealand government would have to do in order to make this work\n[noise] yeah well this is of course there is also with ... years ago and and the Fisher or are they in old sorry um and at that point a stray was asking that New Zealand and full of less than ... that that um we just simply create um and there was opposition to it from the Green Party which has my policies in as well\nIt would create this kind of second tier residence seal citizenship within Zealand um which was really concerning and now it's ... of course that's sort of going to the terrible Lauren Australia potentially\nUm but I but of course there is this a issue and I I have been really close contact with the ... since the software was made\nTo understand what was happening there but um you know it's the broad base um approach that those ... low tax which doesn't just affect the uh you know at the end type that that New Zealand world\nHave but actually you know it kind of unpaid the rights of\nA ... or ... ha that's come through that kind of the arrival pass and because of ... of course for some reason has decided to differentiate between classes of [laughter]\nOf modern said 'cause [laughter] ad depending on how they ride that is one of its I Do understand the opposition but but at at at least doesn't affect\nUs and New Zealand sorry the officer than want them\nYou know I was gonna say 'cause I just wanted to clarify that before I bring down the road roast them ended up on the broad issue the New Zealand off of that you refer to that goes back some time in the past you think that's a good idea that that is a positive for new Zealand's point of view\nYeah say the awful with night by a previous a prime minister or John K and it was when you don't like the immediately by a out prime minister ... when she took office so that that offer 'em one that stands on and of course the practicalities of become complex F F it as ... said that\nUm because of course there are the children and it's Ninety our children um at at last count that I had access to and of course I've got family so it may\n... there's a lot more people than one ...\nRight so it's from a studio here then I'll come back to you both ... watching your mind\nWell look I Know that the you know over the last few decades or being points at which this tension and the free movement agreement I remember you know straight him complaining about using them to come in living on the old and\nRobert ... than using them prime minister famously once went off to you know what are you worried about ... New Zealand is leaving to go to study said well no because he you know every time and he's doing leads to go to Australia\nThe IQ of both countries goes up and despite all of that tension never was this principle of free movement um ever really under serious threat and yet yet here is an example of how to work something desperate politicians become when it comes to immigration and asylum in a few hundred people and\nThe future I'm a ... he's putting at stake of fundamentals of principle of free moving between these two combat than\nYou speak to somebody who grew up in Australia as a refugee\nOn this is one of the things I wanted off doing about you know I my parents um found in stride your face time and I grew up in in a period in which started was a very welcoming nation and no one or two off duty and where where is public sentiment these days in terms of of these issues\n... well well it's it's an interesting question and the and the particular interesting time at which dry skits because ah last night Australian time that we saw in ... I Believe an unprecedented um shift in political or support from the government\nA swing of around twenty percent to in this case and independent but\nIn the context of that ... that was the suggestion put out that the Australian government might finally except they\nA generous offer to buy New Zealand which has been on the table for some some years and indeed one irony is that had Australia accepted that off when it was says made we would have cleared out all the families and children on the road\nNow they're still about twelve hundred people on those two ...\nUm so what's your question they\nTo the extent that the by the ... is an indication and I think it is up to a point there is now a a a real public interest in resolving this problem that\nWhile Oculus play ah the the public could accept that people will be sent to Madison ... full offshore processing with a view to finding some form of Joe settlement within a year or two that full five six years later\nI wanted to ask you about he touched them because you mentioned Westminster Abbey yet there was a mathematical formula on edge hooking temperature T E equals mc huge over a pie Jim Carrie he's vaccinated for

further on that when you highlight some of the brief phone Susan hey what would you choose to focus on\nI really like the essay about how do we shape the future that's very important to me because I've been working in stem education for quite young kids using started having an adventure ... to sort of engage kids the science and so I really like my father is sort of passionate devotion to\nAccess to education for everybody and\nAnd interesting and engaging foundational education in science and tech for kids and how important is going to be the well they're going to grow into he's going to be this well to science and technology and he makes the point very clearly that he's not saying they will have to go out to be scientists\nBy he signed that to have that kind of level of engagement to be a sort of global citizen of the future you're going to need some kind of scientific literacy otherwise you just risk being disenfranchised\nI could become very vulnerable to being lied to and not actually having any means of assessing will you being told him working out for yourself\nWhether what you're being told his true or not I since\nYour frustration of the fact that we could be going down that road to begin to imagine how how how he's frustration\nWhere indeed I'm a you know he was such an advocate of education in every way shape or form and the importance of it and the importance of it being\nA global phenomenon that you shouldn't just be limited to such as elite group of people who would then have kind of the secrets of the universe that disposal but for us to

he even hulking toss out and I remember him texting may in the ... and his fast I'm so excited to seen Stephen Hawking at dinner and the way that sort of inspired and\nAnd I hadn't I hadn't watched it because that he just well was this amazing genius that guy um but actually of course there's another message that was just that we have to make it possible\nFor people um with with severe disabilities to believe that the best most brilliant life that I possibly can and that's something that I think because well we should take from it that we should say ... on may not possible like it it will than\nThey are as well Donny we touched on your work in that field I'm again I'm very much and Stephen ... both in the book and in other other sentiments that have expressed it with you one\nOf the things we're looking at in this work on the un high level pile on digital corporation is is around how do we navigate the complex ethics around artificial intelligence you know it's not just a question of how do we program robots and manage the relationship between humans and machines but\nIncreasingly it's going to be about what's the ethical framework for example of of when machines ... machines when my machine has different interests and requirements to your machine\nHow do we know so there's a sort of whole ethical dilemma here where we need a solid I'm sort of a prince prince set of principles to guide us as we go through this very uncharted ...\nAgain going back to what you were boasting about Stephen Hawking yes you've got to come up with the principles but you then go to communicate them in a way that people couldn't gross but will not rail against yet and that's tough\nAnd one of his but ... is one of these that ... the pages of haven't got much by that but what I Would say about the current one which you know if I'm allowed to encourage people to read\nUm is is that she's very accessible eighties written in a way that people you know without scientific expertise could understand and it will make you think and that's what we need a bit more off of\nJust one final touching field that I took out of it has nothing to do with with signs it was more to do with the sort of the child parent relationship when she made the observation about the amount of time that he was happy to dedicate to follow the mood of how a time she didn't appreciate that\nYeah as of now unless it's written drew furloughs\nYes I thought that was ... willingness to play monopoly and when you think this is the greatest variations of that law started and I probably hundreds of years and but that that tells you something important too which is that you should invest in the future which in this case you have children\nIf you'd ... you'd\nYou'd be quiet please I Want to know

U. T. N. K. U. jak business right now ... ...\nCall side one to four seven one six to nine one thanks\n[noise] [noise]\nBBC was Seventy six seven hours GMT welcome to weekend when Judy I'm Oregon questions continue surrounding the death of the Saudi journalist ... G A senior U.S senator tells the BBC that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... had a significant role in planning the killing off that Saudi journalist we need\nTo think this through and make sure that whatever it is we're dying more dynamic coordinated why but look I Would think that ah he himself partially but be dealt with in a very severe what\nPresident Trump says the United states would withdraw from a key nuclear weapons free trade with Russia is it a good idea\nIt may be morally satisfy President Trump to pull out of this treaty but it doesn't help address the underlying problem\nMy two guests this morning I was one of the Sunday Times and Danny ... kinda Roger secretary general of because you got to hear from weekend after the world news\n\nAnd Canada has said Saudi Arabia is late disposition that Mr ... died in a fight was inconsistent and not believable France Germany and the European Union have raised similar concerns\nIn the U.S Republican Senator Bob Corker is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he told my colleague Julian\nMarshall that he too was not convinced by the Saudi explanation an edge them and turkey to share more information\nIf the Turks actually have this audio tape they need to go ahead and share those with the United states so that we can go through that and that was the the way to end this and for everybody to know exactly what happened\nWithout those type from my perspective I Would tend to believe at this point that it was at the highest levels of government so my sense is that this couldn't have happened without NBS his approval and if we're all\nSo Seventy so you are you are saying that it is your belief that crown prince Mohammed bin some members directly implicated in the mud or all from Jamal ...\nYeah based on what I Know today and they're still more to be known and I may be proven wrong [noise] but my belief today as if this is something that was probably ordered by NBS\nCarried out by people who are close to him and that it was murder now we may find other information son but the fact that they have continued to put out non Kratovil stories\nThe one they've just put out about him getting into a fist fight with them and being killed those non incredible stories even\nMake me more so believe that this is something that uh they're trying to shelter the person at the very top of their regime\nIf the United states should game possession of that old yeah when video evidence if it indeed exist and it does demonstrate\nAs the Turkish media has been saying that ... she was tortured and dismembered inside the Saudi ... how van should the United states proceed\nThis was one of those things where none of us need to react with pure emotion winning that sank this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way but look I I Would think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do think western governments what perhaps too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine and uh\nWe're wrong to believe that he was a reformist\nYou know you said with any of the very impressive individual when he talks about the future of the country and\nPrivatizing aramco and diversifying into other areas his willingness to take on the the most fundamental August and the country to do some progressive things to happen both for human rights another reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch and he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what he did and cutter and the white did it without communicating to other countries was no doubt a rookie mistake what he did and arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt was a rookie mistake\nAnd in the order of this which it would appear that he may have done certainly this goes beyond rookie mistake\nAnd goes into the area being absolutely ruthless we know of what he did at the Ritz Carlton where the pain opposition folks shut them down porch or some of them and so I think we just need to understand that could as we're dealing with\nAnd what his tendencies have ban and now that this kind of activity could continue on for many many years and collectively we've got to figure out a way of having a policy to deal with it that gets to an outcome that is good for the world if you will\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker we talked about the postal ... edition hour ago that's the geo political side will talk about the business side in a moment I'm just picking up all the politics rules about what do you think the wider implications as\nAs many ... and that's I mean\nHe had to be random K flight with managed mad which of St Louis in in major stake having somebody ... possibly will eventually come back and people competing for that money\nAnd you know Neal I think sort of scientists who can't get as many without really thinking why we ... we would want and I'm In London the way she could have they think ... they require\nAnd which of the many people called into question the time and what struck has struck me I'm In the mountains is how willing people lie to hang out and the hunting down some um as the bank reform and a great reforming now everything's going to change without looking at the evidence not healthy\nGo ahead tell the people up top and I tell 'em hey is obviously very briefly and never say much willingness to believe a story that he can actually seem to have any ... any any reality to let Denny\nWhat worries me here is that you know at a time when we're told leaders more accessible more and um they seemed justice on willing to tolerate dissent you know if indeed and on and tell them a commission this killing then it goes hand in hand with the accusations that vitamin who was responsible for the knocking off as as a form of ... around the world\nAllegations that pulled the guy may has gone and kill people outside of Rwandan a form of dissidents\nAnd so there's something here about how I'm deeply told her in town meetings off to dissent adjusted the time and we need open constructive debates\nI mentioned the business side to this and we have a guest in the studio to to look at this in more detail got a new survey is the founder of cornerstone global associates\nThat is a London based political and economic risk consultancy covering the Gulf countries and this is obviously with reference specifically to water is due to happen in Saudi Arabia or on Tuesday this major trade and investment conference billed as the devil's in the desert ... and we've seen significant figures\nPulling out of that I'm welcome gonna end of the people who have pulled out while him packed is that likely to have do you think with all these\nThings in context into an individual is half who doubt but not a companies and I have spoken to many organizations who have confirmed as the participating perhaps ... will German level\nBut there's more junior level um in fact I spoke to someone who was participating last week and I'm trying to get to and then he said it's it's an ... over books with a number of applications they've received a forest and to use a ... it's a very important thing to make a distinction that people are not participating for the optics for the media\nBut in reality they're still going and they're still looking to do business deals which is very\nRevealing isn't there because that might satisfy the media's requirement for something to be done or it might require they might satisfy the shareholders equal recall him up for something to be done but it doesn't stop the business going on\nUp severely absolutely I mean will receive still unraveling and we need to see what what would happen but I very much doubt that there will be a long term repercussions that would stop business or between Saudi Arabia and the west and it's important to make\nThe distinction between the west and the rest of the world because no one from China or Russia\nI'm off putting out there in fact looking and waiting for this ah for the west to vacate the scene with Saudi Arabia which they would feel very very quickly\nYeah Danny I look at it as it happens I've I've been invited to this public investment for a minute I was never going to go and I don't think I'm not important enough figure I'm for it to matter but you know what the clearing the invitation is it doesn't take very long for for the you know the public investment fund to boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets on the management\nThat they have an presumably that's the game in money talks and with so many people so many countries desperate for ... investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this ... billion or ... pounds of of of five billion dollars worth of annual trade\n... a ... trait but as as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi or we prepared to give this up and roasted price Rosen's\nWell one of the things I think Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate neither are the lengths that we have our without the I mean at somebody like in debt and stuff that's happening in midlife crisis leaving leaving that reliable\nAnd ... and getting in finding said if a lays out there are more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to cross laptop come ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean if the ... the ultimate question is how much does Britain any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is different set of values than we in the west operate\nOn what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWas murder is all was

that we can't run long distances at all fosters possible sprint pace how come up ... let us do that\nWhat we have in the body is essentially two systems of energy do differently so we have aerobic
