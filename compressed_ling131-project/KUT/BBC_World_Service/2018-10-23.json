Dolly who gives the exact same message she says the exact same thing about modernizing Islam but he also backs a mouse and he's back suicide bombing [noise]\nSo you got two very radically different political orientation we've we go in and say this is a good figure we may find them associate with political decisions or political positions suicide bombing for mass\nMurder of a large number of opposition members in Egypt that we don't want to be associated with so so bonding particular good guys and particularly bad guys is something that a secular government like the United states is never going to be good at it and is probably going to make some embarrassing mistakes\n\nSo the question is how much can the media did to change these countries and make them more democratic\nHow much accountability candies new voices hold over autocratic leaders as we've seen lately and Saudi Arabia the government does have the power to shut down independent voices but in Afghanistan\nProbably because the power isn't a centralized there is room for a flowering of independent thought and perhaps that independent thought will go further than guns and ammunition in creating a new more liberal society\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nThis hour of America abroad with written and edited by Rob Sachs and produced by Eric replicate with additional production help from ...

D our TV which is even worse than the empty our TV\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatment success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any any comparison to even usual tuberculosis\nAnd even though there were at will be called adverse events there were some lab abnormality almost\nAlmost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped [noise]\nSo what does it with this study does is to speak to the importance\nOf the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases the most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the ... in a multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world\nWhere there are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty thousand people were empty or TV and only twenty nine percent are treated so when they use this new drug but ... and this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seemed to have been the key\nSo what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago and the point where we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd we need new tools that when new tools like in the new medication like the ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of drug dealers world and if it is\nAnd of course the availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where patients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess and extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the ... it's not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world that they were able to do this using their resources under their routine\nOr so called program condition I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis is white and this is this is ... ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough but remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistant and\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy so what happens when\nPrograms don't work well you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis is empty Archie B.

chance of winning a record breaking one point six billion dollar checkpoint\nJackpot but what are your odds of winning and it led you know I spoke to up to lose left in the statistician with Georgia Tech school of mathematics to find out why you would have to be very very lucky\nThe mega millions is a ... a lottery that crosses most of the United states there's about I think maybe four states that are not included so it's really almost like a national lottery in the U.S where people buy a ticket or two dollars and they choose one\nSpecial number out of twenty five ... five\nOther numbers out of Seventy and if they match all six numbers they'll win the jackpot who's one point six billion assuming no one else\nChooses the same number and the winters will get their share after taxes or\nSo I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that\nI buy one ticket mild on winning up ...\nThat's correct in fact your odds of winning or I'm exactly one and three hundred and about one in three hundred and two million and that's true no matter what the jackpot sizes\nBut win the jackpot ... gifts large then more people buy because they they're just imagining themselves a billionaire\nSo even if my one in three hundred million short comes off that possibly others who will be sharing with me 'cause most people have signed up for a ticket\nThat's correct I Believe the the lottery commission has said that they expect Seventy five percent of all possible combinations to be purchased by tomorrow so there is a pretty good chance that someone's going to win\nSo deals on me winning a pretty ... the U.S but the old some someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people\nWill when depending on how the oh the numbers fall\n... would it technically be possible to by so many tickets that you would guarantee you self victory\nIn principle you could buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are three hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each show if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then\nUh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of courses you're not guaranteed but you'll be the\nOnly winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winter\nAnd I spent some time to share logistics of buying that many tickets are going to be easy\n... absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that\nEven if you have somebody going out of all possible numbers in a certain range about one ticket every ten seconds you might be one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the lottery is wrong but you need to fill up three hundred million\nI'm going to need to hire a thirty thousand people and those people are gonna want to share with my ... greedy I Would imagine that they're all going to expect a share maybe they could do a little uh you know if you get the the winning tickets like a retirement and the chocolate

D Archie bait which is even worse\nAnd what was what happened here was that the treatment success was Ninety three percent and that is excellent by any any comparison to even usual tuberculosis\nAnd even though there were at will be called adverse events or some lab abnormality almost all were manageable and treatment didn't have to be stopped with this study does\nTo speak to the importance\nOf the need to expand treatment for the most difficult cases most difficult forms of tuberculosis which is the and and the multi drug resistant\nAnd extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and this is a problem all over the world where there are an estimated almost five hundred and fifty thousand people with FDR TB and only twenty nine percent are treated so when we use this new drug but ...\nAnd this is one of the only one of the two new medications that we have in the world for tuberculosis and that seems to have been the key\nSo what's your major point here we just had a very important meeting called the high level meeting on tuberculosis at the United nations a month ago and the point was that we have to treat people with tuberculosis no matter what form of tuberculosis right ...\nAnd leaning new tools that when new tools like a new medication like but ... is very important we need to be able to diagnose people well and I think most importantly and ultimately we're going to need a a a vaccine to actually address the burden of tuberculosis world\nAnd for that and of course of availability I Would think especially in in in in the parts of the world where\nPatients don't have access to this kind of treatment\nAccess is extremely important in the fact that ever done in a country like the ... is not you know it's not one of the richest countries in the world that they were able to do that using their resources under their routine\nOr so called program conditions I think is really shows the um the fact that they were that they were committed to addressing the tuberculosis is way and this is this is an ... all over the world\nAnd it's interesting because it's such a big breakthrough remind us why TB is so deadly and why has some forms of the illness become drug resistant\nI think we need to remember that tuberculosis is something that is terrible and the fact that we're not able to cure all the people with tuberculosis as as a ... in my mind a real tragedy so what happens when programs don't work well you develop these um these forms of tuberculosis\nIs empty arch he leaves the Archie and that's what is so deadly because it's very very difficult to treat until they came up with the the regiments containing the Doppler for example ... treatment was\nUp to ... uh two years and now when we had the short course regiment which doesn't even have to use what we called an injectable drugs we have to you you get these painful inject shows\nUp for many many days or the treatment it means that we can cut the treatment down too short and as nine months and we're working now in achieving community to get the regimen down to just six\nMonths or so far I listen to this new drug ... and ... it can it really cure teeming all instances\nBut ... is one of the as I say amen to one of the two new drugs that we have whenever we have a new drug\nOr with time if it's not used properly what can happen is that a resistance can develop to that drug so it's very important that we keep doing the research that is needed to develop a new medications that we can give a that we can give people\nDr Paolo if would you are there at the scientific director

I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with that and how collaborative the oddest wants to be I always approach every project openly and esteem that each time it said hold different experience because I'm always different people\nKick the can get very similar to see his but you've worked with a lost his email on this is my choice with my children's\nYes in some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but their results or the fact that you can often be essentially I Would take heart cost or pigeonholed based on your previous work so safe you out a lot of success with women so the oddest it's very likely you'll get a lot of those trucks which has been my experience for\nHim to work with them at the beginning of the Korea is when they still trying to stop dish ... who's going to be in some ways yeah yeah I I find that those kinds of projects get sent to me a lot give me when I look at the spread of office you've worked with they are a lot of women as well is that being deliberate on you and ...\nI don't think it's a conscious decision for a meet people would think more women gravitate towards me but I think I've actually done using videos for more men that makes any sense but then even though I'm working with the men I Do try to use women in the videos from a place of strength or a public place so strong story\nTelling well I Want to get into that it'll go because one of the most effective ways for new music is vi as six you know when she video naked album cover some ways to sell product\nBut give me ... posts nitty drew the line between portraying sexiness sensuality in an office and you know the exploitation\nOh look it depends on what I'm inspired by\n... with the idea of the feminine body\nAnd sex of course but it's from a different places from it takes place is from a place on sensuality does a southern section is a woman hold when she is powerful in her own sensuality I Do explored but isn't tasteful yes I think a lot of the quote unquote booty shaking in videos I mean if\nThat's what inspired by that is why my mom you might be gratuitous in some places I'm never going to a judge when I Am\nPutting a concept together the few things I'm looking at does this promote the art is what are you trying to say I never in a way where I'm going to put a a girl in a bikini\nAnd just have someone to do is that horrible if I'm going to do that you have to me for appeal at the end that makes any sense I'm not knocking anyone that does it I'm just saying I personally just don't think in that way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kids under some schools tease me and said to the gentleman's club\nThe ones who gentleman and the woman dancing\nBut I think in the hands of a different direction that video 'cause I didn't really see any absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it I think that is\nActually the Bush launching videos ever done when he came out it was a it was a big deal because prior to that was it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but old Justin Bieber clean cut and that video was one of the things that broke him into that sex symbol kind of thinking\nAnd I know he's had a little bit nervous about it you know turning Twenty one I think at that time but we came up with this idea where it's just him and it's just these women ... says but it is not like you said it every once in the hands of maybe somebody else\nIt will not have been tastefully done if you saw on the costumes that they were wearing they had the last one that was something very central about the Don says\nThey have the power and he was the one actually those overwhelm\nThe ones in anything where you'd be like a you know that makes me feel uncomfortable is then you probably want to say oh I I wanted to pull daunting now than you know\nIf there was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of those\nFamous video is is that if the American sing a Katy Perry song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production views on the video for cleaned and by then we can sing or how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos and very very different I Would say that it is all for two very very different artists and inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with a novice no doubt you're putting your on Pakistan on a project that there's no way to not do that because\nEverything you do is walk into the tuition and you're making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of kindergartners flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that personal stop or to take an artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more [laughter]\nThing you do want to put your personal something\nA little known as they were just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that isn't\nKing is a product you know and and and it's it's funny because that was a real fashioned about five years ago well they start to started putting their names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about is not this is an assistant for the oddest if anything\nTo king would you say that the common theme is about how women want to come across some these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the ... Steve how are you in ... because sometimes there really are ... I don't always have to\nFall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny isn't that just took me through how you go from page to final put up like what are your techniques\nSo you know they gave me the fall I go back I can listen to a song and we didn't see snatch is of pitches in my head like I Do see like steel frame and then I just have to read those things together and sometimes it takes me\nAnd you know who to come down from that\n... who would you turn down\nI wouldn't really necessarily say without listening to a chocolate without getting a brief nerd anything I I Would like to consider everything that follows them either by having said that I'm doing commercials\nNow and I'm also a mom and I have\nA husband who's on tour and family life is a balance and I unfortunately have to say nerd and much more than say I did back in the day when they started\nBut would you say they're nice that you've moved cross due to the content of you know when it was in the brief when some well\nI don't know I mean let's say I mean that's ... ... let's say to some artists that are\nParticularly distasteful or not my cup of tea or it's\nMaybe it's just like I just find it really boring or and I'm not really inspired by it then yeah I if I'm just not feeling it basically it's enough for me to say not\nGiven what about the issue of ... which is about prejudice discrimination against ... people so I Would say that the enough interest and and most African music videos is almost always light skinned do you agree with that\nI don't watch anything else [laughter] he must have seen some new things that you know I Know that it's a conversation that\nI mean it's a very serious conversation a few articles on the on the art is taking to talk for maybe elevating the life has been women in your videos or just using might seem women in the videos and milk representation of the different types of women yep I've seen that I I don't watch a lot of music videos which is really weird because I mean we live view\nDirector among other things but I don't know if it's a big deal sharing my jury if\nI were the easy ... music videos and I think he's a huge factor she's not something that you think about it too like within your\nCosts thing we know that not about I've never never come across an artist I said you know you get a light of can personal I Know that\nWay from music videos and so she was a huge problem now with girls wanting to change the color of their skin because the thing like the son of the beauties of international thing as being a light skin navy yet and I knew that that's happening a lot in the night German society where they need to do is I've never been put in that situation ever\nAnd if somebody did say if somebody did request [laughter] I'd like to skin female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that\nOh I definitely would have to say on that because if what you're trying to portray all\nOnce you're trying to tell me about a life that can posting\nIs more beautiful than the doctor just because of the calls we can then I'm going to have a problem with that I've never been put in that position\nThan goodness thank God so it's very easy to sit here and be on the Mike and go this is what I Would do but then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably know from all the conversation I had with that person I knew that kind of person I Want to work with that never ends up being put in that position\nCan get you seeing women coming to the fore\nAbsolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the only ... director\nThen which is a very big global company I was definitely the only one in your ... maybe that was like one other one in the U.S but that was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty years you know he was in Paris\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London third yeah like I said I was one fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women I now I think there's a reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls puffing up\nTo think it's changed can get what is it allows for them to come out now\nHow to be specific and to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to access editing and\nAnd also I think maybe a relatively new thing out of the last two years it's been a initiative started by a FEMA director quit on her I'll quote free to ... which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos\nIt's a database that exist on line basically just needs to be female to be a part of it so in case somebody looking for a funeral director they can just sort of go on the website and have a look and say he's out there that basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually pledge to have females in every single pitching process of a commercial for gathering that do business\nKnow Kenny how hopeful oh you that soon you wouldn't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music video director it's already happening\nWhen I first came into the industry I mean you have fuel directed by the window music videos if you think it's a problem globally did when I was\nIn Africa and especially in Nigeria picking up or something king said earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that I'm One of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little gold watching the TV can see that and he just looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls who people like king us seeing people like me\nBut I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry\nNot just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men when I have interviews I very very conscious of the was that I use a lot of times when you when when you have interviews and ... what the tend to say is oh what does it feel like being in ... industry plus correction is it's not a real industries and male dominated industry they're trying to change that\nI wrote that tell you how I had been able to come into the industry things up hot to drugs remain\nI Need to use positive what if I go oh was me it's so hot and da da da da da\nAnd then it might get into the hands of the little girl watches you going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep up and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to see me and see that I Am actually competing in this industry that's number one number two men to ship something that's big for me is every once in a while and then she would go on Instagram go anywhere and just\nPull out women and go come over here you can email this project and then dumped just being around understanding that he can be gone senior woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own direct is\nDoing their own little project okay\nSo ... is your dream artists which is what you'd like to work with Kenny\nI Would say beyond me because she will challenge\n[laughter] sorry we can have\nAgainst each other for that one [laughter]\nAnd my hair and the other time you'll pay [laughter]\nBeyond said is said thank you both can me

Rogers and drawing benches of being extremely well present on the seabed BBC News\n\n[noise] hello and welcome to business daily here on the BBC Web service I made about lead today as the U.S is preparing\nFor the midterm elections we're looking at one hearty perennial of American politics gun control I literally carry my pistol all within minutes loaded by me having the gun and gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself and my wife or my family I can do that yes this year ...\nThe role and funding of the gun lobby has become a big electoral issue but which side will it help\nWe have a candidate outside of stories that whose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed in Florida\nI think the environment in the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the past that's become on business daily from the BBC [noise]\nFebruary fourteenth Valentine's Day at Stoneman Douglas High school in Florida once you're about to hear if some of the distressing audio recorded by panicking students a lone gunman is making his way through classrooms [noise]\nThe attack in Parkland led to the deaths of Seventeen school children and stuff\nIt was the most high profile multiple shooting in twenty eight team but in fact less deadly than to others last year in Texas in Nevada\nThe rate of these horrifying killings breeze by loan shoots as that seemed to accelerate over recent years is also intensified the political argument in the U.S when and by how much should America tightened its gun laws\n... is a reporter with the progress of gun control lobby group based in Washington DC\nGun control is very much a part of this election I think we've seen a number of\nMass shootings in the United states in the past few years that have made gun control a political issue and I think the timing of the Parkland shooting\nIn Florida this February just before the midterms really made it so that candidates across the country have to respond to this issue of gun legislation and what they would do if they were elected\nHow is it coming across a congressman themselves being direct TV lobbied\nThere are more interest groups coming in supporting candidate from the left from the gun safety lobby than there have been in past elections\nI think it's interesting that the national Rifle Association has a decreased presence in these midterm elections either because of their financial woes this year or because they just understands that\nThe money is really coming in from the other side\nThe national Rifle Association or NRA is as ever a player\nIn this debate America's oldest civil rights organization that lobbies for the rights of us citizens to bear arms to keep as it says with the second amendment to the U.S constitution Bob Spitzer is a professor of political science at the state University in New York and he's studied extensively the roots of the organization\nThe n._r._a. was formed way back in Eighteen Seventy one by to civil war veterans who during the civil war saw first hand that the typical American young adult male didn't no one end of a gun from the other and so they formed the n._r._a. to improve the shooting a marksman chip skills of\nMilitia eligible men and they did shooting tournaments sporting competition and things like that and I really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties that it began to turn ... attention more to politics\nCongress passed the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd in the Nineteen seventies there was a measure and Congress to severely restrict access to hand guns\nGun rights people within the n._r._a. felt that they were being attacked in besieged by the rest of the country so that group took control and ever since then they become much more political much more focused even obsessed with what they call gun rights and it's produced the organization that we know today\nSo the n._r._a. is kind of rabble rousing group that is ... the right to the Americans to bear arms is not a gun lobby group and yet it does have a presumably an intimate relationship with the gun making industry well\nThe ... does have a long connection to the gun industry and had behaved as the sort of political mouthpiece because they have one overriding common interest to press as many guns into his many hands as possible\nThat have been a number of school shootings of course in the United states we think of Columbine Sandy Hook and others most recently that's been the Stoneman Douglas shooting in Florida which\nDoes seem more than other events to have galvanized a movement against the gun lobby how much of a threat has that been to the the NRA\nThe high school students who attended the Parkland high school in Florida\nThey did something that victims have never done before instead of seeking privacy and avoiding the media they went in front of national cameras and said look we're sick of this\nOur leaders have failed us we're tired of them being afraid of the gun lobby and they have aggressively push this issue\nThroughout the spring summer and now into the fall of this election year and by doing that they're trying to keep the issue as a top tier concern so that after the elections there may be greater momentum to perhaps in ... stronger gun laws [noise]\nThat it was a terrible tragedy and how he could never find out about the money even if even [noise]\nLord of the shooting them and Douglas students like ... Gonzales here have directed\nThat political file on the n._r._a. federal advocate care alone I described as uprising Lee effective the students efforts to galvanize political opinion and an emerging boycott campaign around the n._r._a. have been\nVictims and their survivors of these of this shooting were high school students who knew various\nLike how to use social media and how to kind of leverage their pain and their fear into politics and very quickly and there are a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to NRA members lot of them are household names you had a rational car companies that I'm sure people\nUse all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all of this company is ... parents say the public deserves to now which companies are supporting the gun lobby\nAnd I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting\nVery quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly hold their relationships with the IRA which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could ... tower\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of firearms for example\nThere are a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that less of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offered this has\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the n._r._a. off these moves\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the ... finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial well as in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting facts that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the n._r._a. spending and these twenty Eighteen mid term elections\nThey're spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all and far\nNot much does appear to be true recent findings in early October showed that the n._r._a. with spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth\nThat you ... percent of the former brought this note to the richest Gorman for what this because you know the the violation of diplomatic immunity grants to set up you know\nIt was a complete surprise because he was in Britain on the diplomatic visit he was against the British Government he had\nA diplomatic visa and the diplomatic possible on he was even mess up and put a member of the foreign office VIP team\nPatrick Robert ... has made a career out the steering senior political figures three public relations crises\nWell normally what happens situation like this is the phone office would tip off of his ... former head of state and then they leave\nBefore anything unwarranted happened but clearly in this case the powers that be decided that they wanted to proceed with the with the rest of them when they did was horrified I mean it was just it was just the most undignified thing for us to do a quick he made contact with his representative\nAnd homeless from twenty four hours from than I was working on trying to advise the general and how to get out of England\nBut getting out of England wasn't going to be easy\nYou know shit is charge for to cry genocide and batteries or an ... charge for the crime or shouldn't our site they knocked him Munich at\nThe request to detain General Pinochet had come from Spanish lawyers hill accused of murdering I'm torturing political opponents during his Seventeen year rule\nThey argued that on the international no European countries could try the general serious crimes committed elsewhere lodge pose the British public opinion supported the idea\nBut says Patrick what's in the general himself now under house arrest and went west remained unfazed by the crisis unfolding around him\nThe first time I mention was in this house on the went with the state and that was a peculiar thing because he was sitting at this lunch table and we had the English special rounds police sort of controlling to the rooms and meanwhile the rest of the house was controlled by the Chilean military and the leading figure in among these was to cook and\nIt'd be bringing these biscuits out in the full of president Pinochet will be guzzling these these little biscuits and having cups of tea\nAnd being extremely welcoming unfriendly to everyone who came into his house and let's face it he didn't know me from Adam these extreme because it is and what happened to not ... did you come at the time I came to the plan but the problem was that you have to remember in the early stages everyone believed this was going to be resolved in the high court very quickly\nBy this case being thrown out and I was absolutely convinced that was not going to happen [noise] did you manage to convince him to shake himself with that I'm not sure if it did my Spanish was never good enough\nNot show by the way that he ever involved himself to that extent to detail in any of these cases if I have one criticism often is that he's in the room was navigator I think that was always his great strengths as a as a president but when you were in trapped between the ... movement of angry Spanish judge and the CPS on the other hand you do need to be aware of what you're up against\nThe CPS clown prosecution Senate argued that General Pinochet had no immunity from prosecution General Pinochet argued that as a former head of state he did the argument went on for months\nYou have to understand that you're gonna do my job properly you always have to be direct your clients and told them what you think you don't need to say to them this is the only way that I can help you this is what you need to do\nWith uh some moments when they just have a blindfold will they cannot move for reasons that are awfully understandable to them but not to me that's frustrating and quite a lot of that happened in the industry case because\nThere were very few people in fact in charge you have Julian army you have the Chilean government in chicken military intelligence or the Chilean lawyers and then you have the u._k. lawyers hired by the truly lawyers\nAnd then you have me what's the one piece of advice he wished he ... he didn't he was one point but I had a huge argument with him about the need to issue an article explaining his own personal situation and his advisors said that that would reduce his dignity\nAnd I said that you know up to Fifteen months sitting in a matter of time and went where his dignity had been substantially reduced\nAs it is and then it might be we're producing an optical explaining his situation\nBut they said Austin fuse well they did agree to do was to have TV lady factor which has been turned into a media moment which went live throughout the world and half of the world cup to watch this thing\nIt was the first of all the way to five months to see now suddenly awoke up they're going to be seen on television for the first time since the rest in London but also lady such a\nLady Sacha nicknamed the Iron Lady was British prime minister and a key ally of right wing leaders around the world\nI Love to jog comfortable here\nI Know how much we have to you they all hell [noise] during the fall comes campaign\nOr the Tea Party made headlines but it made no difference to the case itself\nLawyers with who was pretending that they were doing an office job ... will win the case in the next ... hearing all the rest of it didn't happen it kept going higher and higher and higher and there was zero success in the from the legal perspective from day one we didn't win a single significant hearing\nIn fact the legal battle was leaving against finished shake in Nineteen Ninety nine the Lord's ruled Pinochet could be extradited serious crimes allegedly\nEighty eight when Britain had rushed to fight the un convention on to check it was a momentous decision overturning the international tradition of immunity for full my headset state but Patrick had already begun pushing a different idea an exception on the grounds of Pinochet's ill health\nHe was a frail man it was the question about it he was quite large and that to be moved around with care I think what the media does they took the impression that he was in some of because of the ... we moved around in a wheelchair which was actually simply the easiest way to move a mountain around with a large at school\nOr when you try to go from one hospital project called to another ... to his prison struck home\nIt what I don't just ripple gave the British Government reason enough to know the extradition request and sent General Pinochet hung to Chile [noise]\nLanded back in the south and cheering crowds [noise]\nOne of my funding I remember watching the TV is he going over there [noise] so that she was met by population was [noise] was fifty degrees is return\nAnd the first person on the sun sure enough the BBC correspondent who came ... you told us that he wasn't capable ... goes on the on the screen you could see him getting out of his wheelchair over hurling the wheelchair to one side of great vigor and then proceeding to pump the has ruled the military and the politicians who with the reading\nAnd I was off by the correspondent I mean is this a situation of Lazarus\nMany were asking the same thing but the story for the moment was over and Patrick's job was done\nIf I think I'm not a good job and I'm happy with myself in this case I think did a good job because the guy went home I didn't like him and I respect them because he was he was a very religious man very confused when he was very old fashioned he was an army officer from Nineteen thirty six\nAnd he was amended ... among the respect so old that doesn't mean that you have to excuse someone has been a head of state and moved to ... people but that is a matter for the for the Chilean cools not for us with no information in spending ring\nThat came in Chile the legal saga continued rulings over his immunity and dependency to stand trial with that said back in full spicy chilies and judiciary until in December of two thousand and six General Pinochet died from heart failure\nAt the age

and Russia has been ... such a financial treaties on your weapons and and\nThere are some accusations from both sides of of ah violations but there are mechanisms within the treaties she saw all these things out and ... would be the normal way of doing it ... ... is President Trump guy isn't quite different directions quite often\nI mean you see this possibly on the part of President Trump is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent I\nI Hope it's negotiating tactic and it would be fully to go to town and the rate of another arms race which led us into a navy Seventy thousand

uh just a few months ... a day Trump Administration announced that\nRussia was starting to deploy ... foundation and having said that and I think everyone outside\nThe U.S administration and the Russian administration is trying to sort this out there in large numbers have meetings effects that's going on around the world at the moment at trying to work out just what they find ... actually be of course Russia has it's counter allegations about us behavior as his ...\nUm it could be argued that John Coltrane constitute said hawkish voice so the national security advisor in the White House

it's a complicated game that the Turkish president is playing from his point of view what is the best outcome here how could this go really well from now on\nI think the best for him and he steps down as the crown prince because\nThese fights all the troubles and at this point there is and long running rivalry between the two countries and yet the two managed to have a core new relationship despite
