{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Can you talk about this process of how this push legislation of political attitudes happens\nYeah I'm Glad you raise that point because it's a I think it's a very important thing to bring up\nEspecially if you think about long term future effects and what my research is showing is that\nThese are galvanizing these really major moments for example the election of President Trump I Would say would mark one of them um and particularly the anti immigrant sentiment anti Mexican sentiment that he's taken on\nReally has the ability and power to shape how young voters think about politics and affiliate themselves politically not just now but for the rest of their future\nAnd so the research typically thinks about this is called these moments of political crystal ... writes a really major events like this the Vietnam War has been something that's been studied\nAnd so ... so young folks who've been socialized in this current era a young folks generally we think about that between the ages of Eighteen to thirty five if they were of that in that age and this time period [noise] but that's really going to have a very strong predictor of power\nAnd how and who they support politically for the rest of their lives so you can imagine that an Eighteen year old senior at a Latino in high school somewhere in Los Angeles\nWho it was his first time voting in this twenty sixteen presidential election hearing all this anti immigrant sentiment is really going to shave his political views are from now until the future\n\nMurder says that she experienced is in her own life but she was in college California's Republican governor Pete Wilson push what was known as proposition one eighty seven it attempted to cut off health services and public education\nFor undocumented immigrants if passed overwhelmingly although it was later found to be unconstitutional Marissa whose family immigrated to the United states from the Philippines in the Nineteen sixties says the anti immigrant sentiment behind the bill had a profound effect on her\nYou know in a lot of immigrant homes ah\n[noise] you don't really talk about politics all that much or if you do you talk about politics in your home lands so that conversation really wasn't present at home but it was evident in in schools and in your communities and\nEspecially on college campuses where you started to see what activism meant um and what activism was that's really what I'm I started to witness how immigration\nPlayed such a central role in the lives of many folks and I know many Californians and so for for me that really opened my eyes to the fact that immigration really affects so many individuals I'm at so many different levels\n[noise] did you feel in some ways the rhetoric at that time was was personally directed at you that that you felt in some ways are that you were the target of attack\nShore I don't think anybody who Susan [laughter] it doesn't look who is a non white person you know didn't feel that way I mean it's just it's just the way of it is growing up in this country\n[noise]\nAnd a quarter century since Pete Wilson push forward proposition one eighty seven it isn't just militia whose views have cemented against the Republican Party as white seeds to be a majority in California the state has now swung so far to the left the\nRepublican Party has been nearly reduced to third parties status\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one we're such as California offers a sobering lesson for the future of the Republican Party across the country\nYes having again growing up in this state for all my life it's really remarkable to see such a rapid change in my lifetime and if if you think the national parties for really paying attention to what's happening in states like California you think you would think that they wouldn't be advising\nTheir Republican candidates to use immigration this issue to mobilize their votes because where it alienates such a large percentage of the population so you think it would be obvious that they would say hey guys this strategy is just gonna\nYou know come back to bite you in the next Twenty years don't do it uh but currently we don't see Republicans\nYou know paying any attention or acknowledging the fact that this could very well be their future and the next twenty to Thirty years\nBut there's a tension isn't that which is if you're a Republican politician today you are not necessarily interested in winning election twenty five years from now you need to win election today\nThat's right they are you know current election seeking office seekers and so they just want they all they focus on is the next election which is typically\nTwo years or four years from now right so not to say that Republican strategist having conceded the fact that their strategies are short term I remember after the twenty twelve elections are in the memo came out with this acknowledgement that\nThe party needed to do a better job of being much more inclusive but given that that was the minority position and we haven't really seen any kind of meaningful

T. the Brazilian whack his policy in the Senate will come to you all\nI Want to begin by asking the sense ... the most obvious question while she's the appeal of giant Olson are it does to Monica who do I think\nHe's a person that comes across as gentlemen for many also has the fact that he's one of the very few\nCongress members who haven't been cited in any corruption scandal and I think he has a very clear message that people want to hear and unfortunately they didn't hear from ought to candidates that regarding concerns of public security against corruption of course\nAnd also he's certainly very conservative man and but in a way there's in society is also very conservative so\nDid he goes to a man who comes across as genuine with a clear message conservative values id isn't mud in corruption difficult for the P. T. to challenge a candidate like that\nOr is not new president politics here and be present in Congress and in Brazil in politics for decades these conservative but not only conservatives isn't as far right\nOf course an Irish pro torture and has praised torture in Britain beaches and he's a dictatorship crazy ... says well who's raising it will be no boost\nDrew a Modern Disease from Asian

quintessential onto sub Bush was candidate of course 'cause first target is to be cheap but his main target is the political system as we knew it so the priest each of the political system all parties included\nAre so low in the historical low point in Brazil that someone that appeals to the ... sentiment in the Brazilian society with a credible credentials because although he has been in politics for long term for Thirty years\nShe's has always been an outsider never in the mainstream and a ... was a witness in the past has become clearly as trim\nModel talk so what would you see is is he being his appeal\nI think he had his timing has been excellent he was quietly in Congress for twenty eight years\nAnd now he has made its move he tapped into the disc come came to the frustration of voters the corruption the poor state services the economic recession the job losses\nHe manages to present this blend of social conservatism but also mixes with the economic liberal lives in in his particular vague proposals so he presents these proposals that perhaps I'll bet to reassure investors\nCapital markets both international and domestic have been very ... listening to what type of ... and ...\nGoing on the simplistic solutions sometimes present it may be exactly what people feel is will the would like to hear at this moment\nAnd he is very good at talking he doesn't say much while he talks but that's the point sometimes and I think that is really life at the heart of his success into the mood\nSo let's think about the background to all of this you mentioned the timing mother talks to just give us a sense of the states is Brazil's economy\nTo the state of the economy is just direction the imaging out to a recession unprecedented two year recession alone side this recession job unemployment has\nReally rocketed up from about six percent before the recession started in twenty uh fourteen uh all the way up to about twelve Thirteen percent in recent years alongside the recession the fiscal management the poor fiscal management of the previous government to beat the governments have been exposed\nBrazil's public debt is Seventy seven percent of GDP some six point two percent of back and goes just to interest payments\nThe budget is is in a situation where primaries surpluses of the ... the boom years if you like or under President Lula have absolutely disappeared and living beyond their means rainy well beyond its means and with ... asset to meet\nTo well I should say the current government has made my efforts to reform but it is a very fruit a weakened government I'd of very divided Congress such if I'm that you'll\nYou'll agreeing I think in the background\nI entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history\nAnd the recovery is the slowest ever registered in Brazil in history\nSo it's hard to imagine from outside the levels social frustration and Brazil especially when you consider that prior to that\nThere has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so that the emergence of new so called new middle class\nIn this so called middle class has been severely hit by the recession\nNo laundered that this ... residents society who had voted for the tea in the past is now voting massively for ...\nBut they need to be a victim that second chance of a change in global economics China perhaps demanding the the commodities and so on rather than just of economic mismanagement\nI had the hell we are witnessing in Brazil is a combination of factors we have witnessed a girl and law inclined mentioned Brazil between jobs and then three eyes to Charleston and fourteen a front and unfortunately all words of the criticisms a humorist economic policy that even people\nExcited they agree that there are two measures that she lied during her second there were wrong but beyond that we had that same year political instability and Brazil has had a direct ... by in our economy\nAnd not college divinity though comes out of the corruption scandals and all that has flowed from than a dozen ... he has to take responsibility for that and actually look to that but the ... the the fact that is struggling to win votes in this election you know that it's got that day\nYeah with regards to that first criticism against uh the austerity measures we agree that that they were wrong but in addition to that we have to remember that\nRight at the beginning of this second term off do must governments Congress has approved what we call about the bomb bus which our budget bills that ... that it's easily in Brazil and budget and\nHe just wanted to live by the president of the lower house queen raising jail right now and also true my support from Brazil and opposition it's all politics as worse it is the answer for us\nBecause we can't change the game and that has been damaged referred to present anymore I'm\nOn a ... that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy round\nHas spent a lot of grit and why\nWhy Mary easy to have a budget surplus when commodity boom and the first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I Would have voted for a little bit I don't I'm

we've been discussing to justice and some of the foundations that independent liberal democracy\nAnd we're getting to discuss what's to both presidents he might mean for Brazil's environment and the moment could protection or for the Amazon from logging and farming be lifted\nThe fast let's talk about whether this country's democracy is somehow in jeopardy shy about an hour and it is a former army captain and much of it in a cycle has close ties to the country's current ministry leadership Brazil lived on trips\nDictatorship for more than two decades it came to an end though Neal in Nineteen eighty five learn to accept what do you think uh both in our government would look like we do have the militaristic\nAspect certainly he has had many men that tree advise as\nHis vice presidential candidate is a ... a recently retired military general but it's worth remembering that he in fact approached sudden traditional politicians to join his ticket and they were refused so\nThe military was certainly have more influence in government he's likely to appoint ministers who are retired military men but the military in the sense of the currently operating armed forces I think at this point they asked to trying to not get drawn into let's say this new\nAdventure [laughter] if you want\nMonica who to do think it's less sacrificing perhaps some of Brazil's democratic credentials if that ... and security by moving closer to the minute tree\nThe fact that he's a former military betting itself for many people raised flags but you know I\nThink that the military can be very helpful in many areas of ... of you need we need stronger the fans are in the in our borders right I Would hope that the fight against drug trafficking will take place on the borders and not in the middle of the cities\nBut it's that brings ills is that Brazil's biggest problem and what is it is because a lot of the weapons we were getting a lot of the trade of weapons is is just huge and and I will not entry or is that a role for the police or the borders for the military\nAnd I've heard from people from find the campaign that they also want to use the military for infrastructure projects in the interior of the country which the military has expertise right I'm Margaret\nDon't is that is that usual to have them in a tree and you'll ... would it be welcome do you think in any country to have the ministry are involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity\nAbout the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon and such that extend the sort of nationalist\nView of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way\nThat they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the border very often that seems to be broadly acceptable\nIn Brazilian society\nI think the more important distinction however about the role of the military is on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to where it's growth and development the Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong vocational most\nTo boost Brazil's development and I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or\nDo they think that both tomorrow will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet\nAnd then I don't see how they can expect to realize the sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor to gather stokes about\nA ... there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um been very clear about is\nIf you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on his just didn't need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many reviews acknowledge that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of undecided they kind of the country the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption democracies associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHe's government he's clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending\nHe's already has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro Marquette and ...\nCentury Monica nothing is very clear about what you\nJust read from each other for room\nAnd then they offered him for eight years I don't know how this things worse in real life this coalition has been put together hastily\nRight and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues\nAnd I think a doctor my crew is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the national is the one side\nOf the military and the live routine which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced finance minister Paolo gathered let's see how this play on the program and old programs are deliberately vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called have waters off his campaign what we have to judge if they if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this ... of the comic projects\nThat is why do we go for on the other hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the past whether they're going to be faithful I understand that but clearly that's how\nThe business community in Brazil I Believe as well and you see that in ... just how the stock market and the other behaves when he became a including his lead and then you end up homeless\nHyundai remains it remains to be seen markets are myopic by nature\nYou know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving out again today if I can bring it or is there is that renewed\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil the days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in our lives\nWe have two different very different projects with these two very different Roger\nIn one side we have a view of a sudden our himself as a liberal surrounded by ministry a\nNationalist on the other side it has a dodge who has a guy and a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage ought to have\nBred [noise] so what we have every zoo is lawless state versus I stayed that way we intervene in the economy to create jobs and to fall and the economy more people having jobs market we spend money and he used the present an economy\nProblem is that they don't stop and they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than the world bank and they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why\nBecause the things that both so NATO is saying\nIt's already has any need aid to a reflection on the ground this weekend for example we had a bummer agents being trash can and also their cars being put on fire so de escalation of violence in that she had already gotten\nThat set ... me from Greenpeace how would you describe the future of the environment or in Brazil if shy of ... comes to power dig I\nThink she summarized by a lot of uh our concerns in Brazil with regards to a bummer enrich regards to the issue shows to basically defends his father is to manage\nThe ministry or a recall ... with the ministry of environment or the perception that a recall ... uh where you are calling us the order of environments uh in Brasilia\nSuggested is this threat to the states it do you think\n[noise] no I'm really me put it that way I'm really concerned because I think the Bush a lot has bad instincts as regards to the environment\nHe has a very primitive and regressive bill\nIn that respect but I don't share to sort of got the clues mixed view because I think there are countervailing forces and residents aside even in the corporate sector even multinationals who are in Brazil operating in agribusiness sector they know died of\nA hat on attack on the environment would generate closure of external markets to them so I'm a it's let's see how this play out I'm concerned\nI'm somewhat alarmed but clearly I don't share those catastrophic views that were expressed said before me\nMonica who done Brazilians the jobs the economy needs to grow but on the global stage many people who want to see Brazil taking a lead in protecting the environment could Brazil as a Baltimore has threatened in the past\n... for instance from the Paris climate change agreement\nAnd might be you know and that would be a very very unfortunate thing to happen\nYou know one one a light into a ... at the end of the tone that I just saw today that they he's going to see requested during a his decision to ah with together the Debbie culture minister into\nAnd they environment ministry which um from what I Know it doesn't mean working anywhere any part of the world so um there are a lot of moderate people working for both the ... campaign there quietly working for him [noise]\nUh they're not debating they're not into social media um but they are working for him and my hope is that if he's really I'm committed to creating jobs of the future to foster\nA tourism in in in Brazil especially ... to ... that he he there will be an economic incentive to protect 'em a man in Brazil and um and and I do hope that that happened\nWhen ruling out federal nice to have the time I'm going to move on if\nIf Brazil chooses shy of ... eases embracing some kind of strong mound rule it at face it has become popular in many parts of the well or is this a more profound change that will change the nature of Brazilian democracy a moderate talks to\nI think Brazil as the recession\nOr the corruption investigations have really back to its institutions and for years for decades Brazil\nIn politicians have been modeling along muddling through each crisis each scandal and now I think finally if somebody steps forward and dust is in\nA way that respects the rule of law and shakes up in a way the system yes we could see something like that however\nI really have no ... cautions lots of concerns about it\nThe situation and the most important let's say sign for us to look for is how do the people accept it all things going to be calm\nWhen he takes office in early January who are we going to have riots is escalating the violence that with Tim Tim to bring the military onto the streets\nI think that's the way we will see if we're going to go faster or slower or just actually have a chance for reform dig us\nGot any given everything that Brazil's going through is the near the strong man simply too powerful the old policy to succeed\nNo actually opinion polls have shown that it has changed over the last week between ... storage or this week or was it was lost or at a two percent of the voters he's rejection increased by five percent\nAre going from ... to ... percent with similar to digest if that trend keeps going

Monica is not lost\nMonica Huda yeah I Know I I I we elect to them and ah we ah we don't know who's gonna win elections there was a ... to ... but we just you know we can't uh nobody can celebrate in the elections are have a car\nI'm I'm I'm if people are concerned I think there is there a lot of reason to be concerned about both in our own government and and ... democracy but I'm equally concerned if not more we don't we in from the uh died\nUm and they are the ones in their own program who say about changing the uh the makeup of the uh superior uh um the courts and and the\nChange in the ocean pardon shit that's not true that is not ... I think according to the wider okay are you worried about that and then so that probably ... watch and they weren't clear and transparency that works that okay I\nJust read it says you have also led to UC Brazil's few chat embracing a strongman or ... is just as a temporary change for now is there more profound change at at ... ...\nWell it remains to be seen my take is that in a in a symbolic way Brazil is showed up back in the strong man route but in real life or to run the country is not a one man show Brazil is the federal system\nHas a multi party system has Congress with a veto powers has a strong judicial power so if ... tries to test the waters let's put it that way\nI think she want go very far\nPledged to think about that ... food too I think it says you're fast a Degas got donate Monica who dominate ... thank you all very much if you'd like to listen to the program again or any other from the archive go online and such a BBC the real story if you liked this week program you ... ever\nHave to miss another edition subscribed to pull off such for the real story and you'll ... stop and let us know your thoughts emailed us the real story at BBC don't don't UK or treat me ... for me with Russia and the whole team that's the real story for this week I keep saying\nYou are listening to KU T.

that's new to me and\nOf course the danger is always that people might feel so distant from our pasta at one point that they feel like they don't have to take responsibility for it anymore and\nSo I think we're at a very crucial moment in our education in Germany and we have to really rethink\nHow we teach you about this subject in school and now that the generation both of the perpetrators and survivors are disappearing we have to engage students more on a personal level rather than continuing to teach about the subject in such an abstract way as I was told you about it and really\nEngage them in the process of of of researching stories and retelling stories are trying to figure out how to apply them to contemporary society\nWhere you were shocked as your readers will be when you uncovered those scenes from your home town in the war when Jews were rounded up and some of them were were submerged in the fountain in the main square and people simply looked the other way\nAnd that was actually my father's village um and yeah I mean all the stories I write about\nHis village but also my own home town ... in southwest of Germany were deeply unsettling and I I actually had never learned about what happened in my home town before and the first time I did research on this subject was when I was living in New York City and I went to the New York public library\nAnd I found all these books about my home town one of which was actually written by my former physics teacher in high school in Germany so it was a it allowed me from the safety of graphical distance it allowed me to look back at my\nHome town and both with you know shock and terror but also allowed me to see the destruction that was done to my own home town that I had probably always a close my eyes from\nIt'd be nice if your book were used in schools now wouldn't ... in Germany and elsewhere\nYes in Germany we actually we were discussing doing a young adult addiction and now we're actually thinking that we probably don't need a separate addiction for young adults um I\nKnow Tolkien reasonable for any age isn't it\nYeah I mean obviously I Would wish\nFor any German of the younger generation to be able to use not only a history classic history textbooks to convey these subjects but but other forms some of which could be autistic because I think telling these stories and these other mediums just communicate\nUm the subject of war on a much more visceral level\nNor a crook whose book is fascinating stuff she ended up marrying a Jewish man in New York by the my thoughts on that suit black\nHis son's incredibly interesting it's not a book that I've read but it is certainly one that I'd want to ... a couple of really really important things that I think a right to the heart of this is\nWhat she's writing about it is a a format that isn't the normal perspective\nThat you hear associated with war you you tend to about the second World War in particular you tend to have tax ... those who were fighting or those who were performing criminal acts are those who were the victims what you don't hear so much a bunch of those people who are the generations beyond\nThat are still living in the echoes of that time and it's a perspective that I think is really important for this generation in particular\nBut certainly as noticed sad for those generations that are coming as well\nAnd the second thing that she said that it really struck come with me is this concept of guilt\nAnd shame and the fact that guilt and shame if something that we tend to think is incredibly personal but she was talking there about it's\nA shame I took a human level and we saw that certainly when we were working in Kosovo that feeling of shame and guilt that in this day and age we can still do these kinds of things to our fellow man\nAnd then the national shame and then down one she actually goes into the backgrounds of her family picking up and what is her personal shame and her personal guilt even though she was not responsible that echo still carries on like Rickles into poems into subsequent generations\nCell fairly quick thoughts on that but I think there are many lessons and I think I'm going to have some describe then have the the the interesting aspects of this to me I think uh the the the one thing that we know German should do\nIs to go beyond the guilt and shame and learn lessons for the rest of us um Germany will the new story brings out a very important point that in Germany a huge number of people it's not the majority of Germans were radicalized\nA radicalized in a very powerful and teams where you know very short time and there are lessons for most of this on this\nThank you very much you're listening to weekend\nFrom the b._b._c.

forensic scientists to black and the defense and foreign policy policy analysts so I Try to come\nWere often see this from President Trump said he will say one thing with a certain tone but then perhaps weddings in front of his supporters at Raleigh we perhaps here what he really think so I think is reading from the teleprompter and we've seen this over the last couple of days\nOut especially in fact today calling for America to unify the nation ending the politics of personal destruction he said the recent faith\nThat being a conversation about the ... and ... the of political conversation which of course is absolutely true\nBut then he turns his attacks that once again on the media as we've just heard suggesting that the media is trying to score political points against him and the policy the costs of what's happened over the last few days and it really does Markey you could say almost a new low in terms of the level of\nPolitical debate with what just over a week to go now to the mid term elections\nPizza bows reporting suit black the president was waist actually called for national unity and for everyone to pull together and then it'll became a little bit more muddled right\nGod Singh kind of listen to I mean he really is the master of blame shifting isn't they say that you know you take a situation and you decide I Will have a little statements on it but then I'm going to take your focus on we're going to say we're going to blame these people again\nHe he has this this masterful way of of trying to shift the focus but it's almost so overt rather than covert that it's it's just become a a pizza rhetoric in some ways that we know what's coming we know he's going to blame the media for something whatever will be\nBut it's interesting that on that hand\nHe will blame the media for their involvement but on the other hand if I may go back to the ... case what he's saying is you know it's really important that we have the freedom to be able to speak our minds he seems very muddled\nOurselves we do know dumped way that they will be a towering of the ... of ... of the supporters of President Trump and the ... from some parts of the American liberal media that there is an extremist element among them in the somehow they manage representative often will do\nThe ... has been it's not new this is just an incident is highlighting this division the public schools is that this\nExtremist elemental as we would call it is now becoming very large a and a un it's it's a summer we know that\nWell it it's well of course Mr Trump if he does represent and has exploited it has a cult significant\nA following he has been elected and there is a chance that he likes bike streaming well he's been elected by the right wing um people who are um the treatments like you're like supporting\nSo really what we're saying is that he has ... these are right wing agendas um and he has supported\nThe other hand we do have to accept the way that there is a long gap between somebody who is an odd and supporter of President Trump and someone who wants to send bums his opponents\nNo uh uh ... uh misunderstood you a question I thought you were talking about the extremist elements but no yes the there are a mainstream Republicans who had nothing to do with the St miss the point of course is that\nMr Trump is I'm always tend to to exploit them we'll find some form of excuse whether it's deflecting blame on to the media\nThey if you go back to the Charlottesville case where I'm\nA the poor lady was killed by a a a a an extremist I'm Mr Trump was careful to point out there who blames them both sides so there wasn't an isolation a issue here so the point I'm making is a perhaps misunderstood you a question the point I'm making\nIs that ... he's always ... champion and some of the causes that these people are obviously care about and that's why this individual\nHas stickers all of these calls saying this is if you like on the ...\nAnd I think that's a very dangerous thing and if Mr Trump wants to maintain he's central if you're like less extreme support base it would be good for him and he supposes iffy isolation himself from the extremist because they are a danger to the country\nThank you you're listening to weekend from the BBC will service the Turkish president ... type of what is hosting a summit on Syria with the Russian presidents the German chancellor and the French President turkey currently hosts some three and a half million Syrian refugees\nMore than any other country in the world does our correspondence ...\nJoins us now Sarah what is it that this summit is designed to achieve because it really is marking the conclusion of the womb if we're on a study isn't it [noise]\nWell I think that fucking facts that are outside that has a sense any one this law secondly that\nRussia has came back a training and Russia of course is that case the hostage they thought was interesting about they felt as that composition of course that has set by the tech president President at ... and stumbled on defending got close to that the venue itself but not on the banks of the bus right\nBut it's also type place but they all were apparently the table for the first time that they need to see that many friends and I think that reflects the fact that he wants to expand that dialogue on\nOn the on Russia if I\nPolitician's European countries and they thought it said that they reconstruct [noise]\nI don't have the political process going forward for serious I think Russia is trying to move to dial the own conflicts that's OK about the fourth is Russia and Syria or as much as possible but of course that is an extremely complex situation even now So Russia\nWants to share the rebuilding does it in a way wants to share the spoils of war it's interesting in that case that America's left out of this [noise]\nI think that's a very glaring up so fast that I think it speaks to this new lines cell in Syria and they clean tech ... countries that have had a funny complicated relationship at various points but by now I live at least a particularly in the\nRegion the province of Syria ... months ago they had the cat\nI the miniaturized side of the ... century they add some I've gotten my thoughts on it was the last ... rebel stronghold in Syria and that was seen as a vaccine that humanitarian\nCrisis that disaster that but also of course as I said to myself outside again at Eighteen century heading towards your wife and I think you know the issue of Russia\nIs one that does that kind of than Europe as it does tech anything mentioned that a huge number of Syrian refugees hair and three and a Half Men but also many in Europe too and I think\nRussia has time to talk about what's happening in Syria and normalizing the situation that and then looking for was the reconstruction setting I disliked it minute chance I'll say Russia doesn't want to fund the ... the failed reconstruction and

... or ... years\nSo we really need to take care of that because that are a number of unknown basis\nOr tastes have that are coming from a known sources so in that regards the ministry of health whether we'd W ... they are we know in things boxing issue income thing but because it's going to turn in let's say and mainly for neighboring countries where there yet and that's what I was bored of theirs and where\nThey ... a more difficult to the going thing\nDon't to have a ten ... and we'll keep you across the situation here on health check\nNow cleric couple of weeks ago we were talking about life expectancy is and how long people might live two in the future in ... but now it's a study looking way beyond that how long humans might live in the distant future\nAnd that's just next question of whether there is a natural limits to the human lifespan which we can never go beyond regardless of what medical advances may now this is a debate that's been going on for quite a while and isn't it\nOh yes because everybody's aware that life expectancy has been increasing for quite a long time and that's always been this question I vote when it's going to stop and many people have thought well it's got to stop at some point and it's got to be some natural limit to what the human body is capable of\nSo is it like to study has a competent from quite surprising uncles they've looked at ... uh when we die and they look if you plant the age at which people are likely to die on a ...\nYou can see this time any one particular point in time and it's a beautiful ballad because it goes up and then he reached the peak and then it gets back down on the other side and a nice magical path\nAnd that's a beautiful ballad kind of has been shifting line chat a in people's lives of the century has progressed so um it's just been the kind of still looks the same\nNow though some natural limit on human lifespan you would expect that the right hand side of the cubs\nWould start to get compressed and which are much more Crump tough but he's not doing that\nSo you think I thought so we'll cluster often that you have I don't know loads and loads and loads of people dying eighty five Ninety exact about what's happening I\n... and it's not doing that so I'm of course he doesn't tell us that than I can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happening feature that will ... altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit to if you can find ways in the future off preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways off I didn't ... replacing bones and grabbing new bunch if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on all buddy for instance maybe I'll just a destined to crumble after a certain age will\nBecause listening to a story on making sense of it involves so many different parts of the brain ... set up a trial in a residential ... for an hour a day\nFor forty days off the people watch TV and the other half attended shed reading grit and eat the idea of any ...\nBeen something that caused the skinny kid little let get they ...\nThe people were sitting in a circle and we started in the in the Frist let's say than training sessions we really short stories just because those people\nAre suffering from medium stage of dementia so they're they're not like really able to follow you after let's say ten Fifteen minutes that you're speaking to them\nBut when we were going on through the training we start doing grease the lens of what we were reading to them so if you think that the first session was about around ten Fifteen minutes in the last ... session so after forty days\nThey were able to to follow us up to an hour over reading which is quite impressive actually an hour and I and I was quite a long time yeah yeah and of course we use different kinds of effects so indifference by the worst like short stories but then\nWe insert longer stories on the ... abruptly book in which the patients had also to remember the last episode so it was a more demanding kind of training in the last part of the forty days\nAnd then off to the forty days people were tested again ... sort of different says did you say between people who had been listening to reading and the people to be watching TV\nWhere are people who who were watching TV they just didn't show any kind of increase\nWhereas the experiment the group the groove a lot more in many different areas such as the first one was memory but then also language and even a pension and even visual perception actually retrieve something really new for us but\nDid you see any difference depending on what kind of dementia people had yes\nWe do that for muscular demand shot or other diagnoses\nThe improvement was more than for the assignments ones were you surprised by that well not really be goes outside matter we know that these are really really bad form of dementia that affects the old brain so we were you know we kind of expecting these kind of results\nA more you think it is about listening to someone reading aloud that's making a difference because it does seem extraordinary in a way that this could make a difference to memory well\nNot really because when you are actually listening to a story you're actually during the hearing some of your memories in order to feel\nThe holes that are in the story so let's let's do a little experiments if I I started reading view of someone waiting for his luggage you might visualize in your mind song I don't know maybe ...\nOh yes or no stretch away I was thinking of an apple and I'm thinking of wasting and that the that hasn't even started yet\nThat that was I mean so your brain works with some ... and those groups you build these groups on the basis of your own memory basically it's back and forwards\nKind of process so the story gives you some and like you feel these weeds your own memories so it's not really surprising actually\nAnd people seem interested in the stories that they were being read to people discuss them together\nYeah so beautifully I mean you're not allowed so there's a lot of variables coming in in the experimentation but I can see it at all those variables\nActually three grids by the reading because you have something on which you can discuss with the others so it might be that it's about how ... D reflects your brain and also the situation that comes up in this kind of training\nAnd with the kinds of differences that you saw in memory how important to all those all the difference is big enough to allow people with dementia to do something that hadn't been able to do for all to take power more in conversations\nAre well I don't know but let's say that you've before the who didn't actually remember\nAt least of names after let's say ten minutes now they can do that so there's a little bit of improvement\nBut the main improvement for me it's about out of your graphical memory so once they start to to have a better memory and the vet the vet for months using memory destructive to that allows their own stories\nWhich is something that it becomes really really bad in the form of dementia so at least\nReaching that point in which you got to remember something of your life or your own life that I think something really good\nSo what do you like to see more reading aloud in presidential campaigns to try to help people\nObviously obviously I Would like to see these upbringing in many many different situation because it's the strong training it's a really good training and so it's really cheap and easy to implement you just need a book and have everybody wouldn't most everybody we have a book in our house and someone who read to you\n... not Platt is was a small study so I guess it's not suggesting this is enough to slow down the process at the mentors that but it's\nIt's really interesting it was really interesting um we we've got to be careful as well because some with these kinds of studies\nThat can be a big placebo effect you know just I'm from the extra stimulation that people got probably interacting with the the people who were reading to them and in fact she's already recommended by nice the official ah UK and they chests guidelines buddy\nUh that's one thing you can do with people with dementia is just trying to get them more mental stimulation in in various ways you know just talking to people and trying to stimulate then ah intellectually in any way you can\nAnd this reminds me of some of the interventions that do take place the other side of this happening down on with people with dementia things like singing all reminiscent therapy\nYeah from innocence therapy at sense on my similar because in a way on getting them to tell their own stories and find new uh you talk to people about their memories from that used and you you might use pro psych photos\nFrom when they were children or object so videos if you have them to try and get them to talk about some of that very oldest memories and we do know that same people with dementia off and it is so very oldest memories to tell them like intact\nSo I guess with the lack of effective medication anything that might help people's memories if they've got to venture is going to be a good idea\nYes it's understandable that people are resorting to all these rather unusual techniques because unfortunately we don't really have any good medicines\nThat can do a lot for dementia I mean they're all ... people can be given they tend to just um ease symptoms ... hops don't wet for everybody and unfortunately they they can get side effects to southern not right for everybody so and this is why we're trying such unusual things now\nThank you very much Wilson from Nissan tests are coming in today and thanks for having a ...

Bush and then the tea policy now clearly this is much more significant step further along that line\nBut I Do think you can be completely tied to the existence of the Trump presidency there was a very interesting\nPoll last year some time that said that Republicans I hate to Democrats more than the hatred atheists and that really says something America\nCan violent language that lead to violent acts as he seems to have done and to ... states through the decades or the politicians within democracies think well there isn't an impact there are enough safeguards\nAnd I think we can be very clear about is of course in in this current situation the president says no these are despicable acts we\nShould use and fine and he's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said he makes comments these acts so they try and make a distinction but we know puff the well\nThe language does influence actions in the political sphere down to you know because politicians ever go out and say necessarily ... some guys it's historically you know go off to these people but they creates a situation an atmosphere where people pick up on what they perceive\nAs the unspoken consequences of the politicians will lead lead his actions and they go out and do things so I think there is a response but it's you know politicians to be careful about the language they use because they have a platform\nThey all reported widely

their food I used to do I use is to say things that were funny and people felt that entertaining when I actually realize that I ... I could be a stand up and they used to watch this show called Martin the close custody block was um they were locked up for twenty three\nHours about 'em out today and I was like the gentleman on that block and ice to perform the whole Martin show\nFor them but they didn't have a TV\nNothing maybe even know what the show was so I Would just formed the whole show and so when Martin and went off I just start talking about what was going on around the prison got to have any I have any more material\nAnd then somebody asked me you know what you're going to do when you get out I said man will be a stand up you know I I was interested in when I was younger kid you know I never dated but when I got out I was like yo that's this is the way for me so I just started kind of\nSharpening my observation skills and then I was working at a department store and I went to this spot colleges joking on Apollo night I got to the first night I Need to say nothing\nWhat was it like ... and the guy that made everyone laugh entertained everyone inside prison\nIt was like a a responsibility you know it will fight broke out at me you didn't you didn't do a good job they're more [laughter] you did you did the added to the more the man you got to work all you'll grab\nIt though by noon you people still fight men knew a man you got to go right a whole new set of material which you're going to talk about today you know\nHow long state you were released from prison did you stop performing stand up\nI got released and I told but what if the rest of Nineteen Ninety seven is by December out on the stage of Ninety seven\nDid you make a conscious decision not to talk about your life in prison for lunch punted he'll stand up ...\nYeah I made a very conscious decision not to because I didn't want people to think that that's what my whole life was about [laughter] so so that's the that was the that was a day like Ava Ava looted\nOh so many prison conversations in prison interview because my first Seventeen years I've never even mentioned it will be will just talk to me about normal life and so when I used to speak about the conditions of incarceration in incarceration is country\nOf people thought I was talking from a review our readers perspective or or something and I'm like I was talking to ... inmates perspective from being incarcerated and seeing the conditions as in there so\nNow when I'm Out now my comedy sometimes in my conversation will lose to those who have came out of it that space how to navigate through this space in being in a free society which is way more disrespectful and way more ... should be in this society that we came out of\nYou um filmed in jail for one of your ... what was that like\nThat was really exciting to go to jail and um and actually\nMy do my show in there to see out to see if I was just still translate could still come over into that environment and do what I'm doing outside you know I knew that outside was going to be easy because I was doing it in that environment I didn't know if I'm doing it for\nTwenty years in the ... in this society can I go back into a jail and and read a light from a perspective of being out\nAnd come in from this disposition and not being in there with him anymore so and then actually get no I'm a chance to talk to women that way across the rate it was was very exhilarating that was that was definitely something that\nI got a chance to show that this country has a moral stain on his fabric that we will lock up our women and our children and ... that your women are committing crimes and your children are committing crimes while\nWhat do you think about prisoner for ... has to change to still people getting into prison in the fast pace\nCommunity outreach community services wouldn't things in communities\nAnd having the community right I live in a very selfish country there's very arrogant think this is the greatest country in the world but we have a huge homeless rate but we have a band and build ... homeless people we adventures on the street where we have abandoned buildings but we have homeless people\nWhere I live in an arrogance society so I have to start for people to caring about each other first that lots\nOf capitalist societies but the rates of incarceration in America at a much higher than other places in the wild justice system needs to change\nThe system needs to change its out on the stand about other countries but there's a difference\nMostly capitalistic arrogant or because they have free healthcare we one of the richest countries in the world and our citizens don't even have free healthcare which healthcare and your health is a big problem with finances if you don't have finances you won't commit some type of crime\nWell she'll ... she'll go going forward what's next for you\nYou just gotta G building a resume acute having a ripple with people and they keep doing community service that you want to do and then ... or ...

production of the modern free uh supposedly affordable electric car\nMeanwhile a super unveiled a plan to this right or if it's forty thousand drivers in London to go electric by twenty twenty five would help to find a victory vehicle funded by a so called clean as levy on passengers they're expecting offer them twenty thousand to make the switch by twenty Twenty one\nNow that sounds ambitious especially given the need for someone to charge or one of those new electric vehicles who was northern European chief Jamie hey would told me that was certainly a challenge\nThe moment or in the u._k. we have only twenty thousand charging points across the u._k. we compare that with\nOther countries such as new way or Netherlands they will have a head of population ten times the number of charging points so that's a huge challenge at the moment the majority of people who have electric vehicles\nOr have a home charging solution so they'll buy a kit and then they will they will instill that in the home or they will sort of charge that call that\nThe difficulty as you say is most bridge and most of the drivers don't have all street parking Sony forty percent of the British population has access to all street parking only Fifteen Percent of uber drivers\nHave access to all street talking so therefore the home charging solution will not work\nOr when we want to go from electrifying the few to electrifying the the money I didn't go free for you to do twenty thousand goes we've got three is to to do twenty thousand calls and build an easy infrastructure charging infrastructure that

people are traveling now the the reason I think why the u._k. charging infrastructure is not as well developed than other countries is because it's a little bit of a catch twenty two there's a catch twenty two where the people who are responsible for rolling out the charging infrastructure\nDon't have the incentive unless they have clear line of science into a launch vehicle base of electric vehicles who they know that kind of service and also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric vehicles unless they know the charging infrastructure in place so that's why we think

years or so ago\nBut when and how they evolved and spread has long been a puzzle Lawrence island of the University of Pennsylvania has thrown a lot of master the boss fossil record to account this important question\nAll our ancestors during the earliest time period or fishes so we have a backbone and these are the first things that have bone and kills which is why they start to show up in the fossil record at this time\nWhat was very apparent ... the fossil record you have from these times is incredibly ... she\nYes so one of the issues that we were actually trying to look at is why is it so patchy why is it that in the earliest stages of vertebrate evolution and we only find bits and pieces of things that looked like scales are looked like they might be skull and only in very restricted areas\nIt presents a problem for us because we can't really determine what these pieces are necessarily and it also brings up a question of why are there are so few of them this early on\nI mean how fish like off the clients to fulfill the talking about what we recognize them very readily as being really to to try out and called\nNo so they're actually pretty different so back during this time period and most of them are armored they look more or less like clam shells with tails at one end and I like headlights at the other end\nWe would recognize them as fish because our concept of fish is pretty simple I mean any five year old can draw fish but they wouldn't look anything like the kinds of rape and it's just that we're familiar with today which includes cat and trout\n... you've done is even though you're saying that the fossil record is for men tree that has enough of the future for basically a lot of heavy statistics are the problem of how these things evolve\nAbsolutely so over that time period we had more than twenty seven hundred different records of different fossils\nFound in different locations and\nBecause of the way fossils are preserved because they are preserved in the bottom in the sediment we can determine the environment\nThose from the rock and chasing the fossil itself and also the invertebrates that we find there and so that gives us a lot of information about where we're actually seeing the fossils and we do see them and we can use this to reconstruct where their ancestors should have been\nSo that they were four hundred or so a million years ago swimming around like die the sink to the ... some of the ocean and you can recognize what kind of stretching the walls from the safe being buried an\nAbsolutely so sometimes we see corals buried along with them so we know they were at a wreath sometimes we see that it's a river bottom than it has the classic river rocks and can collaborate\nYou came out this was the idea that there was some kind of environment that was more conducive to fish evolution than others\nYeah so the assumption from studies of modern fishes and studies of invertebrates is that everything sort of originates at coral reefs coral reefs are really complex\nThey have a lot of life a lot of opportunities but in these earliest rates we just weren't seeing anything that was recognized simply a fish that had bone and so the thought was well maybe it's just preservation of biased maybe they should be there or are they actually coming in somewhere else that explains both as bad record and\nTheir early evolutionary history\nAnd civil conclusion to become\nSo what we found is that vertebrates in fact just as the study fossils suggested were highly\nRestricted to pretty much coastal waters what you would call lagoon if you went to a tropical island well ahead of the read and that they continue to originate and diversify their for something like a hundred and twenty million years so every major group all the way up through sharks or own ancestors the bony fishes\nShows up in this really restricted habitat away from the recent basically anything else\nSo I mean how deep when you say it's titled how people do to be in these settings\nBasically from the actual beach to about thirty meters at the most but well above say where wave action would be occurring during a heavy storm\nAbsolutely school they go home ocean\nTo ... to live next to you know they do with more ocean and members land and they all just plugging as far as you can go to these coastal regions\nExactly and it's not to clear to us why they're doing that at this point it may be that there's more nutrients there that they face less competition from the early ancestors of insects and sea scorpions which are already in resetting at that time and swimming around and maybe eating tiny fishes if they come across them\nAnd this is look at this from what you're saying that the sort of the innovation was going on in these coastal wall says but they may have spread out they could have come to other parts of the ocean as April but all the new species all the new lineages seemed to be born in these very interesting coastal regions\nSo it seems that invasions of the other parts of the ocean is heavily dependent on the sort of traits the sort of forums that they take out in the shower\n... so it's really only those fishes that happened to become streamlined and flexible and more active swimmers that that later on in the reefs in the open ocean the truth of it is that fish is actually move into freshwater first which I don't think anybody would have expected\nThat's very interesting so the fact that you know talking of hour and a fish the ... to be fish that sort of just started coming up on the beach oh it sounds like they would have to do that kind of expression from the beginning\nYes it does seem that way and it's another good analogy because it's the same situation where you have traits that show up in some shallow water environment like limbs in lungs\nOr the other traits of catcher pods which are land animals and then that's being used to move into a new environment but without any further incredible change until much later\nLower and solemn who study appeared today in songs and if you'd like to go back to another one or two hundred million years biologists might be

[noise]\nOf President Trump I Would say would mark one of them um and particularly the anti immigrant sentiment anti Mexican sentiment that he's taken on really has the ability and power to shape how

much or if you do you talk about politics in your home lands\nSo that conversation really wasn't president at home but it was evident in in schools and in your communities and\nEspecially on college campuses where you started to see what activism meant um and what activism was that's really what I'm I started to witness how immigration played such a\nCentral role and the lives of many folks and many Californians and so for me that really opened my eyes to the fact that immigration really affects so many individuals I'm at so many different levels [noise] did you feel in\nSome ways the rhetoric at that time was was personally directed at you that that you felt in some ways that you were the target of attack\n[noise] sure I don't think anybody who Susan [laughter] who does it look who is a non white person you know didn't feel that way\nI mean it's just it's just the way of it is growing up in this country\n[noise]\nAnd a quarter century since Pete Wilson push forward

Party across the country\nYes having again grown up in this\nState for all my life it's really remarkable to see such a rapid change in my lifetime and if if you think the national parties for really paying attention to what's happening in states like California you think you would think that they wouldn't be advising their Republican candidates to use immigration\nThis issue to mobilize their votes because where it alienates such a large percentage of the population so you think it'd be obvious that they would say hey guys the strategy is just gonna you know come back to bite you in the next Twenty years don't do it uh but currently we don't see Republicans\nYou know paying any attention or acknowledging the fact that this could very well be their future and the next twenty to Thirty
