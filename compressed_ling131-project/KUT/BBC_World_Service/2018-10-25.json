you know feminism and all and websites and I just took her to the teen vogue summit and you know it's a privilege if\nI get to take her to these things that I'm invited to these things there's nothing\nI don't even know if my boys would be well you know they're young but I don't know if it where they would be welcome or where this\nConversation is happening for them and you know part of like where this moment needs to get to is you know like I said earlier I think you know\nThis moment was uplifted because\nWhite women who are privileged are speaking out and that's amazing

Russian trolls or or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again\nWhat's the definition of foreign aid and which country gets the most in official development assistance\nMilitary

the laziest folks getting into it\nAnd it told us she was someone by the same it's the police to explain herself but she refused to tell us which police station she visited she also said police complaints filed against her but he executive assistance to the head of the St Petersburg natural told us he wasn't aware of any complaints being filed\nAnd directed this to the press officer putting them on a ... questions [noise] Oh yes and in case you're wondering we do try to track down supposed actor heavy due we reached out to him on the Russian social media website the contact to\nBut here's the thing after he's was what made public he's account disappeared\nThe Marco story doesn't end there\nNo it doesn't it turns out that this whole saga caught the attention of the European Union says disinformation campaign\nThat essentially a group created by the use diplomatic service to keep an eye on in response to Russia's disinformation campaigns\nAnd windy spotted on a speedy one man's spreading they decided to run to the piece on their website under the headline\nViral man's spreading video is staged Kremlin propaganda\nSo we have this viral video that's meant as a protest against men spreading one of the people on camera claims to be an actor and as he campaigned cause the whole thing a crumbling hoax\nDid they have any evidence to back it up\nWell they focus on two main points to the interview with the man who was supposedly pay ...\nBut he also singled out one of the media outlets that published a ... do you remember in the now yeah so you mentioned that earlier on\nRights or the you described them as a social media platform that and I'm quoting successfully brings elements of Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign to launch international audiences\nIn other words if they think their teeth into a story it's likely to be propaganda\nFrom that you use point of view more or less yes but here's what we know bouncing the now they're part of a company based in ... that are produced is content for social media some of you can use the some of it more light hearted\nAnd they do have a historical linked to Russia Today the TV channel funded by the Kremlin that to U.S intelligence agencies have accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the Russian government\nNow originate with our ... it has never been some kind of propaganda outlets there's no kind of a down editorial talking points that laws that goes out nothing like that\nThat's Jay re stocks the chief operating officer for ... the company that is in charge of in the now I spoke to him while he was waiting for the plane in the ...\nWe are an editorial league and the and an organization that received funding from a government that just happens to be in our case is Russia so it gets a lot more attention than others like PBS ABC et cetera and I guess that's understandable in the current climate\nSo they denied there spewing out Russian propaganda as the ... suggesting Jay also told me they weren't the only ones publishing a story about ... and on top of everything else he says in the now was skeptical about the authenticity of the Wii U which they made clear to their view was\nSo Marco what about Anna how did she respond to this allegation that her video is quote staged Kremlin propaganda\nThat yes it is it is and how is it possible that campaign which was thought to review faking he's\nPublish its fakes itself seriously it's a disgrace\nYou've heard that she's not happy about it but these by these accusations despite the abuse he received on social media and the following days she says her work as a self this\nAbducted this is fall from them\nOr did you when you smell the gas that won the relates to the subject of feminists and I had tried to me I have never ever called myself a feminist I don't really like this what right now than\nAny of his nose quality it is about that feelings towards men hatred I don't like it was very much\nBecause of the way it was still shit it's really been turned upside down and\nHold on wait a second ... let me see if I get this right now in a video and it describes men spreading as quote an act of gender aggression an outright disrespect to women yep that's right but she refuses to be described as a feminist\nRun again two for two and interestingly enough that social line often echoed by Russian state media decides that feminism is an evil west an ideology focused on hating men an ideology that he's not compatible with Russian values or culture\nOkay so what does that leave us well\nWe had the allegations that have been made about the video that it was stage that was part of a broader propaganda plan by the crime and and by the way we did put these points to the Russian embassy here in London they said they don't understand what exactly the video is quote unquote ... ending okay interesting word\nBut we also had how the people involved in making in spreading these speed you'll responded to those allegations again they said sole nonsense and fake can use so to get to the bottom of the story I think we need to dig a beep beep oh ten you will take us to Indiana to meet a Russian troll hunter\nAnd we also find out why those Russian trolls developed an interest\nStone walls okay made a ... with us [noise]\nBetter now check one two Oh yes a lot about a lawsuit

yeah I Do it totally for fun I live in Indiana it's cold here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually\nDo and uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian troll\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's Jesse ... thing he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly staring arguments on line\nAnd this journey began a few years ago in the run up to the last us presidential election\nI felt like I had gotten a lot of misinformation and disinformation on line over the course of maybe two or three years leading up to the twenty sixteen election and I decided to go out and figure out where I got this this information from\nI didn't exactly believe that Russia was messing around on social media when all of the major news reports came out but one came out that listed the name of an account and what that accounts social media name was\nAnd that meant that I could actually go out and look up information on that account and got me really interested in\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic with that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing\nA Josh has a background in programming and I T he understands social media and he knows the mind a patrol because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nJumping into hashtags on Twitter and are sending out tweets that trick people into thinking on someone else so when there was a a thanks Michelle Obama supposedly high schoolers were sending out this tweet with pictures of their\nDisgusting looking launches I'd just randomly looked up bar fun to play and tweeted out with the

looks like in real life and he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of dispense spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these Russian trolls or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again\nThey're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it on to their state funded media social media platforms\nOn Wednesday the losses suffered on the Dow Jones index wiped out all the games mates I found this yeah but as he has former prime minister Najib ... has

with that questions is an agreed definition of foreign aid and also which countries launches give the capital and foreign aid to the best way to measure how generous that country and [noise]\n[noise] good questions time plenty to talk about before we take a look at the numbers let's deal with the definition of foreign aid the organization for economic cooperation and development\nThe or we CD created a strict definition of age in the Nineteen sixties they call it oh da ... official development assistance don't surprise pox is executive director of a day to a research lab of William and Mary University in Virginia and the United states\nHe explains ... three conditions needs to be met for aid to classify as a da\nTo be a grant or below market rate loan from a government agency in the donor country the second condition was that it must be focused\nOn the promotion of economic development and welfare in the recipient country\nAnd the third condition is that the recipient must be a developing country so military age or any other type of aid that's focused on advancing\nThe donors own national security interests that does not qualify or there'll be a word aid from one developed country to another developed country you know say Germany bailing out Greece that would not qualify as oh da\n... him all from ... to pox lights were in the program now that we've got the foreign aid definition out to the way let's take a closer look at the numbers more or less reports at least a nail has been busy looking excel spreadsheets\nLizzie let's stop by examining Donald Trump's claim that the U.S is the world's largest give up in the world by fall a foreign aid\nWhen if we look at the fish leave a coach numbers then yes he's absolutely right those numbers are made by the LAPD development assistance committee that's an international farm twenty nine countries including many of the largest ... is not the u._s. UK Gemini Japan and France\nI took a look at the numbers teeth asked in Seventeen and us provided more than five billion dollars in aid\nGemini per second with twenty five million dollars and he said was Eighteen billion dollars\nOr not might not come as a big surprise given those countries have some of the world's largest economies\nAgreed and there aren't any bill surprises when you look at the country to the Boston at the last ... I ... I Can't make up the Boston St intensive types and amounts given by the FCC the Memphis and none of ... in the wild tasty not just to kind of nice\nNow a listener Lydia Austin is what the foreign aid per capita was a better way to measure how much of the country is\nRight they lay you divide the total amount to country against by its population and when I did that picture changed completely the United states gets rough eight hundred and eight dollars ... passing which paces then seventeenth on the left up to twenty nine countries have three days before\nThe Scandinavian countries to take the well known way leads the way with seven hundred and eighty dollars passing and sleeping and then not fed and fulfilling the nest contributing ... five hundred and fifty dollars and four hundred dollars perspective me\nA while the Scandinavian countries contributing so much\nWell let me take you back to Nineteen Seventy when the United nations tickets suggestion from a condition than ... feet to defend them into assistant ... countries get no point seven percent of that crisis national income to fish ... by Nineteen eighty and they test\nIn two thousand Seventeen only five of the twenty nine obesity countries met at no point some sent pocket they was Sweden Noxon that newly Denmark and the United kingdom the average across oh let me see countries with no point three accent\nAnd the United states is ranked twenty second giving no point one a sense of Christ national income now if the United states wanted to get no point in some sense\nWould need to find an additional ... billion dollars on ... five billion dollars it already getting\nBanks about Lizzy so that's the day so when we look at twenty nine countries the report aid spending to the CD but what about the ones that don't some more secretive than others warm in particular has brought pox again\nChina is a particularly opaque donor and lender it has opted out of international recording systems such as the city's creditor reporting system and the international aid transparency initiative in fact Beijing considers the details of its overseas development program to be a state secret\nThat didn't put ride on his team also\nWe've developed an open source method of data collection that provides very detailed financial operational on location all information about Chinese government financed\nProjects all around the globe coming from four different places from English Chinese and local language news reports from document that Chinese ministries embassies\nAnd economic and commercial ... offices put it in the public domain from the aid in debt information management systems of China's counterpart countries so think of the finance and planning ministries that are on the receiving end\nThese incoming money and then finally there's a large body of she's studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we developed this\nVery in depth methodology to synthesize all this information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government finance projects and a hundred and thirty eight countries around the world\nSo to the numbers show in terms of what China is spending it tastes off the old the world's second largest economy\nOne of the major findings that emerges as the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government does not qualify as foreign aid and the strict sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding\nDoes not qualify as oh da and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data two thousand two thousand fourteen China spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison\nTo us provided at least twenty five billion dollars of OJ each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a foreign aid the U. S. outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the o da is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for the U.S to be outspending China on OD a by five hundred percent suggests a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China\nAnd the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen the U.S government spent roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you broaden the aperture and use that broader definition of aid China spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion dollars a year\nChina gives lots of aid money to Africa and spends particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications\nBecause most of these projects a commercial that don't count tools or da ... China's a path it's a number it's around fold almost the person for OJ\nThere are a lot of complexities and how this insidious biases actually crept into medicine one is\nThat there has been historically a great lack of research into medical symptoms and conditions that largely impact women so auto immune diseases things like how she mode owes lupus MS and many many others\nWithout the research of even says dog to calm to diagnose women\nWe know for example that it takes a woman on average who has an auto immune condition five years and five different doctors to get an accurate diagnosis\nA so there's a dearth of research women have largely also been even excluded from the pharmaceutical research so even knowing how medications work we often don't know how these are working in women\nAlso of even argues that there are a few financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to do expensive research into food that people can simply pick up from the local green grocer\nAnd women are having it anymore and as women are not finding what they're looking for in the conventional medical model they are taking back their health if you will by taking more responsibility for themselves so many women are looking to things like\nNutrition changing their diets what supplements might be helpful ... botanical medicines they can use what are some of the mind body connection that they can explore through\nTherapy or body work or how do we incorporate meditation and yoga\nStacked food and medicine hush pack a gluten free hash tag seafood\nDecide to of healing yourself

my period for three and a half years I'm new to the diet due to the dye yes now what you're describing sounds quite dangerous thing absolutely it's definitely dangerous\nOf viva believes that things have to change to\nProvide the best medicine and the best safety for women we really have to start understanding why first of all women are so disenfranchised you know this not being seen not being heard not being taken seriously\nBeing dismissed being insulted being disregarded and these are all documented phenomenon\nIn the medical literature about this medical biased against women but also start to look at some of the therapies that women really want to have as part of their care\nAnd start to do more and better research on those\n\nIt's a strange power do so many women are flocking to these practices which were dismissed and seen as not being violent [noise] and yet some of these women seek out wellness off to having that own pain and illnesses dismissed by the medical establishment in the first place [noise]\nIn some ways I find it inspiring the women of taking things into their own hands instead of giving up they'd be seeking the healing they need and yet this can leave women vulnerable to practices which may not necessarily helps out much off the\nBus [noise] maybe the how a wellness the woman is less about whether a practical diet ...\nWomen want to look out

Washington correspondent Chris book club owned by the politics but also the investigation into those devices\n... talking to your earlier in the news about that remarkable story from South Africa University students say this invented a brick made using human you are in\nThe process takes place at room temperature avoiding the need for the costly and environmentally damaging kilns which are used to be normal breaks at high temperatures and we have one of the students here a witness who can tell us more about a\nAbout the research tell us more about what you've discovered\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm so I'm actually not a student on the supervisor of the students\nForgive me or on the giants then\nIt's fine [laughter] so so basically what we we looked at the natural processes to make the break and we use the prices quote microbial carbonate precipitation so it's essentially the same way that\nCarl is made in the ocean and what we do is we use bacteria to remove the ... and the carbonate ions\nFrom the urine and in that kind of makes cement and when you when you add the bacteria to mold of any shape you essentially get a solid off that shape so we started with little columns and so we solidified his columns using the prices\nAnd then we moved on to making the brick and that was on failed about two days ago\nSo you were mimicking the natural process ... if\n... and tell me how he went about doing that because you you use human urine did you ask people to volunteer [laughter] not collecting ...\n... yeah so actually it's part of a integrated persists or the the first stage is we also developed a the world's first fertilizer producing\nUrine and in the urine or we produce a solid fertilizer and in what we do is we remove the liquid component and we used to make it\nSo that's why I always call it a stage prices so the stages we make it like that and then the second stage is we make the brick and the third stage is we make another driver so John Cho Christian object we collect that you're in ... stowed our lives a year in those\nIn the engineering voting for the University of Cape Town\nAnd we have some mail Dina's donate their precious and from that and we made the brick\nNow I've I've seen the brick obscene brick kilns and reporting stories about ... about how it's made in the damaging effects of it and and the really really hot now these these springs don't need to be heated heat it up\nAt at toll according to your research and your and your experiments how does it solidify the way the way it does just naturally\nSo so you basically what happens is is so the little bacteria or keep on producing the calcium carbonate which is the Senate\nAnd the longer you leave it the most the mainstay essentially make and what they do not actually face in ... and ... particles to get so when you\nWhen they are the assault dealing as as a as a break because I'm a I'm a normal break\nSo so just to give you an idea when we first started this crisis last year we\nThe very first run that we had we achieve the same ... military strength as a forty ... limestone brick and in just a few months later we've doubled that strength now just by essentially\nChanging the material that we put into the mold and then also allowing the bacteria to a point we've only for longer with zero heat\nWith Sarah so oil at room temperature so any any

that you've made with these threats yeah\nUh no no no it's still very early but um I have to say that we went the first people to come up with the idea of making bricks using\nYour ... so that's actually what we take from the urine is we off to the area so there's a company in the U.S called by a Mason and they use\n\nThem but they are but they use in the area and if you know anything about what comes from it's really not a sustainable crisis or essentially what they do they take the oxygen from the edge\nThey use a lot of energy and then they converted into your ear and when we started this project we we well I knew that\nFor example year and has a lot of the predominant component in it so I wanted to know whether we could actually the same thing but is that you're in ... states are offering a much more sustainable prices and the short on faith is we can some now we have to see how we take\nSo many questions on this my editors just said that does it does its thing Dillon I guess it does [laughter] as well\nOr the process but the brick has well\nNo it's okay so let me just clarify for the new show prices or what it does is as a byproduct purchases\nAnd its them any of that you're going to smell us or if you've ever had the opportunity I guess it safe for example you had to pay like maybe a cat and Pete in a corner and you have that strong smell them or any of being released\nAnd so those prices produces ... as a byproduct but what we wanted to do is we want to comment on that I'm writing it into another fertilizer because essentially at some nitrogen rich source of potential for drivers so that's the third part of the price of federal was talking about\nSo that's the next day to see if we can convey that to another\n... and health risks in this done\nSo I get the health risk so we have to apply for complete ethics approval as you can imagine the university so that was drawn to it\nSo and so don't ever come in contact with the urine it's it's just like you wouldn't use and all you're in the health effects so if if people are concerned with the passage ends and harmful bacteria\nThe prices for using stage one actually kills all on full pathogens unpacked here because we operate at a stream the hockey H we operate at about twelve and ...\nSo that ph is trying to kill pretty much everything and then what we do we take that liquid component truck the PA slightly and then we allow the bacteria that we want to be in the mold and then that's what we use for the brick\nQuite remarkable ... thank you so much for ... for joining us and explaining this to

terms for what has happened many others in the world of finance media and politics of also up to to boycott the conference what am I staying away is set fan and he's the founding partner of the Silicon Valley see fund fifty years\nAnd get effected me quite a lot you know at the end of the day we wanted to be able to support those positive reforms but it became clear as that showing up at the

sound\nSo you'll sending a message to the Saudis are you're sending a message to the people in the state to invest in you\nKnow I think it's a it's all all around I think that there's an ethical awakening happening in business in general driven largely by millennials\nWho believe that businesses justifying questionable behavior in pursuit of profit just simply not acceptable in Silicon valley more and more entrepreneurs are starting to ask venture capital is\nThat where does your money come from who are your funders a and we think this newborn awareness is incredibly healthy for the Silicon Valley ecosystem and is incredibly good for the world and it's a trend that we hope continues and we believe that you know while most diplomacy is best left to diplomats that business leaders can have a role to play\nAnd so we hope that this help send the message that Saudi should move in the right direction\nThat will be those who say it's ironic all of this because I haven't been summoned already had a\nA ... an unsavory reputation in terms of the war in Yemen for example the bombardment of that region some of his saber rattling towards some of his Gulf neighbors are and indeed the oppression of journalists especially some women activists in Saudi Arabia itself\n[noise] absolutely I and you know we have not like a lot of what we've seen it but it's my belief that you can't judge someone just based on where they are you have to judge them based on where they're going\nAnd and considering the culture and values of Saudi and where that countries Ben I think a lot of the reforms that Mohammed bin Salman had them on that that had been very positive and so in terms of the arc of its progress up until recently we've we've like where it's been going\nSo what are you going to do now\n[noise] well now I'm going to hope that they re committed to the vision twenty thirty towards modernization towards the liberalization\nAnd if we see real positive signs that they are doing that and that they're taking seriously human rights that they're taking seriously the fan of believe that they're taking seriously the rights of journalists enough women a van and will will potentially rain gauge but until then we're going to be standing on the sidelines\nRight I mean what would that take ... what it literally take a major gesture such as the release of virus human rights campaign puzzle something specific law that are those would be good\nFirst steps I mean I think we have a long way to go in terms of gender equality on the ground in Saudi Arabia would have a long way to go in terms of liberalizing the cultural norms we have a long way to go in terms of moving the country away from fossil fuels and of course there are a lot of people who are wrongfully

forced\nTo take a stand on political issues where they have student in the past\nI think that's a fantastic uh since the Nineteen seventies business has been dominated by this idea called the\nIn

employees at the expense of the society around them at the expense of environment they spent the human rights bad things happen and so we think that there's a real generational shift on her foot

against opioids across the United states that's a question I put to Keith ... he's a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University insist as a drug policy advisor in both the Bush and Obama administrations\nIn the last twelve months drug overdose deaths seem to have been stable in United States but we can do for sure if that means it's getting better because we had a period about\nFive or six years ago where they were flat for about twelve months so we're hoping that's going to turn down but we really don't know at the same time has to be said you know when you're at\nOver Seventy thousand deaths a year I'm being flat would be good enough I mean we really need you know a substantial decrease to feel that we're making a big impact on public health\nAre so remarkable comparison saying that Seventy thousand cigarette is almost as many people who die on the roads and from guns in the United states each year\n[noise] yeah it's extraordinary I mean another figure that you know I I sometimes call it to people is since the turn of the century\nMore Americans have died of drug overdose than died in World War one world war two put together oh this is the worst epidemic we've seen you know ... it's even worse than age actually or the ... in terms of the the amount of death you'd have to go back to the flu epidemics of fifty years ago\nTo find a time where as many people were being cut down in the prime of their lives as we're experiencing right now with the opioids\nAnd all ... to ... still prescribing some of these drugs\nPhysicians have changed their prescribing significantly in the United states in the last five years but we are still way higher than for example\nOr the u._k. would be I mean we got to a point that we were outstripping Europe by you know factor of six to one per capita and outstripping nations like Japan like thirty five to one why is that\nUh if we have a for profit health care system that you know doctors are paid based on the number of people they churn through and I think prescriptions help you churn through quickly\nWe do not regulate our industries tightly enough and they promoted products like oxycontin and it's the most famous one very aggressively they pled guilty in federal court to lying about how risky that drug was\nAnd uh you know I think that's sort of corporate lightly regulated way of of regulating farm I regularly to health care system is a big reason why the U.S has had this explosion of prescription opioid addiction\nNow President Trump signed into law a new bipartisan bill to try and address this crisis does the government have a grasp of the full extent of the problem now and how much of a cross is it is\nWell the bill or the law was signed yesterday and I worked on that closely with our Congress it does many smart things in terms of covering a care for people who are addicted to opioids throughout various insurance programs Medicaid which is focused on lower income people Medicare which is focused on\nOlder Americans but fundamentally we have a very long way to go I mean does the bill is allocating you know something like five or ten billion\nDollars towards this problem uh whereas the White House council of economic advisors estimated the damage of the profit five hundred billion dollars every single year\nSo um we still have not uh you know put the kind of money on the table that we did for age in which was needed to turn the AIDS epidemic around and uh it's really just going to depend on you know we have an election coming up and who comes in and whether they want to make them more substantial commitment and has been made so far\n... is not limited amounts of money going to be able to do ... would you be able to do if you have more\nAh it will have things in it like the overdosed rescued drug ... uh which doesn't remove addiction but certainly saved the person's life starts they're breathing again will be distributed to sample police and firefighters families and people who use\nOpioids around the country if we'll find some training of professionals who we get more people in the field and know how to take care of addiction\nThere's some interventions for people who are leaving correctional facility which is a very high risk time for people to go ... contrary to stereotype it's actually hard to get heroin in prison and then when you come out you haven't been taking it for a while and your tolerance is lower than are extremely high risk of overdose does a lot of smart things like that but you know if you really want to\nMake a difference got to make a long term commitment throughout the entire health care system and that would be rather than saying we're going to have a two year grant programmed to do now locks on or a three year funding stream for treatment of people leaving prison you would just say look addiction is part of human health it has been\nFor all of human history we need to make permanent commitment to have adequate treatment for addiction adequate screening or for people when they see their G. piece of it we catch a dictionary we need to permanently invest in training doctors how to handle pain\nProperly and sometimes of course that doesn't mean prescribing opioids very often it is uh\nU.S authorities have stepped up their hunt for whoever's behind a series of pipe bombs that have been
