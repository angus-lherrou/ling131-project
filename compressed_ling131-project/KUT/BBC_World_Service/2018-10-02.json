here\nIt's largely year's results above foolish policies of the United states\nJust take Iraq for example you know they fought a war a a long war eight years in the Nineteen eighties with Iraq and now they have tremendous influence in Iraq why the United states topple Saddam Hussein\nAnd left the rap wide open for them they make the same argument with regard to Syria someday arming the cat for a seat in Syria but it's not because of anything they did it's because of the foolish this of the United states\nWhich dropped this big ass show\nThe U.S as you point out pursue pursued\nRegime change in Iraq through well would you support regime change as part of taking a hard line against Iran for sure\nI I'm not I'm not sure the I'm not sure the administration is obviously not there but I think you definitely want to take on the containment approach towards the Islamic republic an exact containment strategy is effectively\nA regime change strategy I think you do want to ally the United states with the demonstrators on the street so I think you do want to alive him to the massive rupture and\nAnd the green movement of two thousand nine two thousand chance or you know the problem is that the moderates Enron keep getting stuff\nA and there's one thing we know certainly is that Hassan Rowhani the president of Iran is not a moderate use a founding father of the security studies a founding father of the intelligence ministry and I must just say that some of the commentary that came out of the Obama administration about him was just historically\nAbsurd it had no basis in primary material Derrick sorry about that dark dark side of the regime change questions as well for you\nJust taking a hard line mean working\nDeliberately towards regime change in Iran\nIs hard to see how the United states is going to a ad in the middle East that is Congress with our interests with the current regime in Iran\nThat doesn't mean that regime change equals military invasion uh like we saw in Iraq or but I think\nThe u._s. followed us presidents for both political parties has made this clear even Donald Trump I think a grades with is that it's it's it's hard to see how the United states can serve its interests with the with the Islamic\nA regime in Iran so what are the implications of that car shocking\nI agree with rebel that outlining ourselves with people who peacefully protest for political change in their own countries\nAnd it's almost always and where the United states to seek to me that whether you take action to overthrow the Iranian government or whether you're just saying use our tools that hand to draw attention to create friction between the government and our people for example by drawing attention to the fact that\nThe Iranian government strapped ten thousand names I stay electoral rules for parliament\nBecause these people had political views that\nAdd the Iranian government wouldn't support to draw attention to the human rights violations says torture of prisoners arrested in two thousand nine\nWe can do those kinds of things and how forced accountability on the Iranian government but doing more than that I worry a little openness that tail and John Mearsheimer and future\nJohn Mearsheimer point you\nKnow how ballistic we go when countries like Russia interfere in our domestic politics again the hypocrisy here is just stunning\nBut do we change\nLegions software I think we believe in sovereignty when it comes to the United states why should we believe sovereignty when it comes down in the country is the second point I Would make is when you look at our track record role on regime change Ukraine Afghanistan or Iraq Syria Libya it's one family\nWhy are you confident that we can make regime change weren't in Iran and have a happy ending was not found so many times well one\nOne I just say one it's not us that would be making you know there would be the Iranian people we aren't doing anything that they don't want what we can do is we can stop enriching the regime\nWe can and put the sanctions backup which we are doing and they were going to come back up and force real force come November\nThere's no sense on a in fact giving that regime for their money so I continue with James abroad and I just find that absurd and I would just say this I don't want to get into the rock discussion here though I'm quite willing John ten second I Will just make note this you know as\nAs bad as corrupt as it is a you know the Iraqis democracy still exists it is still struggling and guess what\nMuch of that democracy is not terribly

twenty five percent voted yes and Seventy five percent voted no that was that represents a swing a five percent towards the yes side\n\nKnow negative really confused I had no idea what the question

percent voted yes fifty six percent voted no that represents the swing of Thirteen percent towards\nThe yes side\nIn the final resolution it's time to take a hard line in Iran and the first vote

seem today I first went to the ministry of defense and spoke to wean come on to he just happened to you by the phone out he was confused by the question so I then went to the national archives dream

a historian Lizzie do some history on it too but we'll do we know about the life expectancy of ...\nWell I actually think it's the kind of a strange question I mean talk to any last at sixteen weeks so it'd be full moon natural took about five or rights than life expectancy say that's where it started and what did you find out\nWell I found it seven hundred and each one step a pilot he voted the ... which was given to men who feel at least one so the chairing the bustle both died seven hundred and each one pilot a one hundred and fifty one died during the ... which remember Ernie lasted sixteen weeks\nSo the majority actually survived about Tibet sorry declined ...\nYes even if you look only at the man he died the average with all the time was about seven weeks but remember he's the only the one hundred and fifty one man who died\nSo that tells us nothing except to concerned that the figure of four weeks must be wrong nobody see the people who died during a sixteen we ... are on average only going to last a few weeks it'd be mathematically impossible for them to live longer than sixteen weeks\nYes but we do know is that it was a very dangerous job about nine pilots died each week out of touch too full of seven hundred and eighty one pilots so the mortality risk was more than one percent every week\nAnd ... depending on how many of the seven hundred a drone pilot well active anytime still I just did a pilot you\nWere more likely to survive to flip Britain than dying it what about the antiwar\nWell fewer than half of these pilots survived the ball on may twenty percent died during the ... and ... and we'll\nMeet again soon to know who I don't know [noise]\nSo the life expectancy of four weeks it it's one of those statistics that isn't true\nBut even challenge because everyone feels whether it's the kind of thing that ought to be true but I don't think the heroism of spit far apart is really needs to be exaggerated but don't you number nine I did have a question that Lizzie just this week there was a memorial service for Mary Ellis who flew spit fires in many other planes during the war but managed to lift the remarkable age of a hundred more

infantry per se fit in the navy incest photo\nBut nine ten chance to survive on the west in terms of it's surprising but I suppose we all going to see fewer casualties just the nature of war changes the historian David that gets in point of the more technologically advanced we become\nMore removed from the battlefield we are you just need to look into the power to see these changes for example the battle of Gettysburg July the ... to July to Eighteen sixty three was one of the bloodiest moments the American civil war twenty seven percent of combatants were killed\nAnd beyond that in Syria and six hundred and eighty six eighty it depends on on its last is not she's fifty percent that trait that depends on which has snake I buy\nCompare that to say the battle of ... in southern Afghanistan in August twenty ten won't Australian died no Afghan allied forces died but thirty Taliban were reported killed\nThat under the shrinking because arm is a smaller has less close combat

Jessica\nHi thanks for having me what's wrong with a little promoting gender equality given that women ... under represented at the top of California's companies\nOh clearly underrepresented ... grossly underrepresented and not only grossly underrepresented but we know it's incredibly important to have women on\nNot just publicly traded boards but on private boards we know is incredibly important to have women in politics in the law and we're nowhere near that I just don't like the fact\nThat this is a government mandated quota and I actually think that it's likely or has some serious legal issues and may not withstand constitutional scrutiny\nRight so you think businesses then might if they push for it to be able to get this little I said\nI think absolutely businesses are ready to file in court if not tomorrow the next day and the problem for an American court system is of course we have something called equal protection under the law\nAnd this last this sickly on its face creates a preference for women and I'm not sure that\nUm that California will be able to defend that in the legislative history when\nOur law makers were debating this there was an analysis that said there could be some serious legal challenges here and you can't just point to statistics and say there's roast under representation of women because that is true you need more than that to withstand constitutional scrutiny\nBut if companies themselves on a lot of companies on putting women on boards and the government you'll saying shouldn't be able to to mandate to then some companies would get away with never having a woman up until\nI unfortunately I think that that is largely true but the government can do something without mandating ... so the government can say will create incentives will give you tax break if you want to have more gender diversity the government can do a number of different things to exercise his authority without mandating a quota\nThe other thing is I think that it's not necessarily going to get us to the policy outcome we want to ... you take the legal issues and put them to the side\nI think it's going to be very difficult for that token woman to walk into the board room knowing that she's only they're not because the corporation believes in gender diversity but because the law requires search too\nI think that can be difficult for both men and women in the room and it doesn't matter as fairly lead to better policy outcomes we want\nLike you just gotta just because I've been to that for ... cents\nA stress and I think so no disagreement

today are United by single designed to improve women's health\nAnd the mission could do so has to pay down to ... different settings in ... and the United states\nLooks appointed Johnson is an American cardiologist has dedicated her whole career she's thinking about health and women's prospective focusing on the different ways men and women respond to diseases she's now the president of Wellesley College one of the most prestigious women's colleges in the U.S [noise]\nBook to declare Mohammed is a sin money medical doctor who helps run among other things a four hundred bed hospital with a new refugee camp called to the edge west of Mogadishu at one time the camp was home to some Ninety thousand displaced people the majority of them women and children seeking shelter from the decades long ...\nIn Somalia well conceived ... plenty to talk about [laughter] but I'm not just not my own skiing poorly chosen to put women at the center of the work you do\nMy grandmother when I was growing up suffered from very severe depression that went on diagnosed for quite a long time it ended up actually leading to her very early demise\nThat was one of the very early sparks that interested me in a better understanding how we can think about disease and and treat it out of my own experience but then as I developed in this field of women's health and beginning to understand\nThat there were these profound sex differences across organ systems and in psychiatric disease as well and to better understand what happened then and how we actually change the path forward\nOne of my earliest seminars that I took as an undergraduate at Harvard was with a professor at Emory at Harvard and she was the first ten year old woman and the biology department at Harvard she was a renowned feminist and had worked to\nDevelop a field that focused on looking at biology through a feminist lens and it really opened my eyes to the historical issues that women face but also how that intersected with biology\nScience and with care and I came in wanting to be a physician and it just sparked a life long journey for me\n[noise] decode why women for you of course my mother's first gynecologist in Somalia so seen her working hard and saving the woman's and she lost her mother doing to birth so that was the motivation for her and she was inspiration to me\nWell she's an incredible woman you mother Dr ... she's a physician human rights activists and twenty twelve Nobel Peace prize money well she pulled to the reason you choose to become a doctor actually that was not\nMy first choice when I was growing up because hospitals to me were second like um area we leave the next to the hospital so as a child that used to run and hide and play in the hospital and in our own family my both siblings and my father had to see the asthma\nSo I have seen and learned to med scene so early as age of ten I knew what injection means and everything to me it was a little bit boring\nAnd it's like now I Wonder if the story and I love history I used to listen old grandmother who come into the house and\nMy mom's like no you don't have a choice I built the hospital for you so my journey was chosen by my mother and I resisted when I was very young but one civil war happened and as age of Fifteen when I deliver first child\nAnd decided did you see where I have to be you know this is where my energy is more important than anywhere else says my delivery and my first child that made me to accept my mother's plan\nYou when you didn't have as your first child Fifteen\nFifteen I have no idea in mid seemed background anything I had to watch this woman was my mom was doing the surgery\nAnd I'm running to them and saying that she is about to deliver and they say we in the middle of surgery just to go look out there and I'm standing next to this woman freaking out the screaming and she's told in Manhattan and tell us that like just told the child makes should they try to do some fall so\nAnd he's twenty four years old\nAnd he's just get married and then I'm so proud of him and it said it was like\nYeah I think credible [laughter]\nAnd did did you come across any of these IDs and your medical training of sex differences in terms of how we diagnose and treat patients because he will change in Russia is that correct\nDefinitely for us as my mother's work and my work it's just putting the woman's house first\nIs not the scientific level is just to give them access and being first and instead of coal contend nation taking care of the only children and emergency but no one is thinking about the woman so that's where we were thinking about it I'm every woman has to have access to health care and it's a basic healthcare clean delivery\nAnd knowing about Dr Jackson's work it just makes more fascinating yes that's A People's ... spoke with that's with the research should\nBe pointed when you were a practicing cardiologist how do you think your gender incensed you approach to work\nAs a woman I think that women look at you for sure with a certain level of trust and you as a woman also understand the context of women's lives so approaching women holistically that as such at the center\nOf women's health it's the intersection of the biology with what their social and environmental context in which they live as well as somebody the other factors that impact their lives like the legal structure and\nI think being a woman you've lived that life and you think have a more natural affinity not that it can't be taught it can be taught\nBut I Do think you were starting in a different place and\nYou have a headstone when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make you were a woman\nIt's a huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you in discussing sexual issues there Ninety eight percent of some other woman went to the F G and female genital mutilation so their challenges they're difficult to stay facing you know\nBut also their rights biggest challenge you face in as physicians in Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait or has been a brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just different activities more if we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just asked\nWhat was your breakfast I usually asked my patients do they have you eaten you because she sometimes for gets herself he has ten kids and she have an even eaten you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us until ... when a female patient walks in one of the things you're taking into consideration and it comes to like ...\nFor my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years yeah but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family\nA lot of thing I learned from my leadership and from my mother is you need to just think beer and you need to think ten steps ahead because you're working in the war is on the air\nAction I make in a conversation a house with the community leader or maybe we're lord I have to things like what is the consequences of this\nCan you give an example of situation you face when you have to come up with a solution quickly\nIn the middle of a war we had a tack to hospitals and one time and that was\nCommunicating with one of the leaders in the area and making sure they stopped shooting the hospital because they were just shooting everywhere around and he\nDidn't understood what hospital you know the consequences of people there had to take a minute and or almost ten minutes ... mothers children's\nThese guys had no clue what he was shooting see sitting with him and talking to him and begging him and saying we need to evacuate and the word of evacuation I could on finding some money language that was my struggle so I can explain and somebody just wait\nThirty minutes to evacuate the patients and he was like I Can't stop someone shooting me and I could understand his point because there was a cross fire and he's he's like you telling me to stop someone is shooting me I Can't stop\nIt was very hard and until I fight for him and talk to him and spend time with him and I got a window a Fifteen minute to save almost\nForty five they shouldn't be had in the hospital quickly than those kind of situation you have to be understanding them and being flexible and not be an aggressive I have to watch my voice do make him more angry so he started shooting more\nThat's more extreme level of some which is rare happening but it's not every day but every day it's just you have to watch what you're saying and you can cost a risk to the community\nThat's an enormous level of responsibility to take a I mean how do you handle it\nIt's enormous and then it showed my mother being just Seventy two now and\nGot two strokes she's build chair bound to the house this trust we are going to it's it's extreme effects in our house it was always telling my mom I don't want to be Seventy two in a wheelchair I'm very honored and lucky to have a lot of men tourists and\nBeers in here in United States and I got all the ideas information I learn how to improve my leadership so I'm trying not to be the only one defendant and everything so I give the leadership to a lot of leaders on the ground\nAnd poorly you to the African American president of lowly college in the United states and this is a prestigious women's college and he's alumni include Hillary Clinton Madeleine Albright what was it like to take on festival\nBut it was a great honor as you can imagine having\nA focus on women's health through my career and academic medicine to transition to a position of\nLeadership and understanding not only how we prepare young women who are students to really make a difference in the world but also what is it that Wellesley College can also do to make the world a better place\n[noise] employed eve cooled woman's health and equal rights issue as important as equal pay he's a really important\nWithout health what is there I think that we have to really focus on health and wellbeing as central to our equality and it is an equality issue as we think about\nThe work that we do here providing an environment in which young women can grow strong where they are educated but also where we focus on their health and wellbeing it's the totality it's a holistic\nApproach health and wellbeing and economic parity or in my mind and extra ... linked and societies that don't provide economic parity are most likely not providing parity as we think about health and wellbeing\nAnd decode what does it mean to you to be female community leader\nMy community undermines you as a woman but being a woman leader I have more windows to have a conversation with men because I'm not affected them so they could she didn't know community leaders elderly were loads and go in front of them have the conversation much easier than if I was a ...\nA huge disadvantage that come to the things as a woman leader as advantage and that's how we save our community me and my mother was doing from a steady five years to work\nAnd so on are just very crucial to be a woman leader in woman on the table so that's that's the only way we can progress and bring peace in my country\nPoint what does it mean to you to be a female community Vita\nIt's a great honor to be able to use your voice to improve the lives of others and to have influence on\nVarious aspects whether it be policy whether it be here at Wellesley whether it be and how we carry out medicine both in the United states and beyond before I left academic medicine we\nHave produced a large policy report talking about the sex differences\nAnd pointed out where progress had not been made and that report was taken and what it led to was a very large policy change just two years ago at the national institutes of health\nThat will now mandate the inclusion of women an adequate numbers in all phases of clinical trials but also mandate the inclusion of female cells and animals in pre clinical studies\nTo have that honor to work with my colleagues overtime to see that change happen it's what we live for\n... what do you think you take away from your conversation with pointed stay\nAt ... of honor and to to just to be in with her and listen and I wish I could just listening to talk [laughter]\nSo the the policies you're making a difference is you know I'm I'm so fascinating reading all the research and that will consider thanking the medication I'm given to my woman patient you to females patient how they will affect\nThe body so I learned that from you ... and I'm very honored\nIn Portland thank you [noise] deco I think the power of your dedication commitment you are enormous courage you're bold enough\nHow you conceive of women's health and how you make that actionable in the most difficult of settings is truly an inspiration so thank you\nWell I think he's chief both ... and ... thank you for having us\nMy guests today would do to declare Mohammed ... who runs a hospital in school with a new refugee camp in Somalia and dumped pointed Johnson who's been at the forefront of a mission to get looked just to considered gender differences in medical research and treatment\nI'm back again next week with a brand new episode in the meantime do check off to all ... any episodes of the conversation you might have missed or if you haven't already subscribed to put caused such BBC the compensation wherever you get you put costs

World Service with Maine to hold on to this week the program is coming from the bench coat or a pack cafe in the Netherlands run by volunteers with sewing machines so bring on a screwdriver\nThat trying to fix all kinds of broken stuff everything from rich genes to recoup plus you've got something that's still working you can bring it in an hopefully one of the several volunteer repairs the scope and know how to fix it up for you the aim is to stop people\nThrowing stuff away this happens all over the world so we're looking up with a similar event thousands of miles away in India to repair a back in the u._k.\nWe lost ... sub spread around the world how they're trying to revive the last auto repair\nAnd walk if any difference they can make to throw away she saw her to join us in a few minutes off of the news from the b._b._c. World Service\n\nAnd and hopefully you're going to have them fix again I don't feel good looks or right now so almost finished a\nFree you can you bring your stuff to be fixed it for free\nYeah of course but every Pakistani isn't run a without any calls\nSuch as for example we don't pay any written hit so that's not you\nAre but we do have a loads of coffee to pay for [laughter] and so we do have some costs and people keep us we asked him to make a donation make a donation or for what they think it's way and sometimes it's with some much for that\nYou're not going to say that the company might be a bit of a misnomer because it is not actually being held in a cafe is it no it's not snow now no I don't blame thing here she from the u._k. I put my own device which is I Am\nIt's a it's an electronic say dispenser taking off ... who can't leave this move now to fix this that's not the way we work we prefer to do what you gotta ... fixing together is much more fun conscious leaving ...\nDon't go ... no no no you know right so um and you sit next to ... and you talk about because he also needs your information\nWhy isn't working what happened how did you break it wrong so with that little bits and pieces of information you want to get that sometimes you have to hold screwdriver old talk the middle step policy do the work yourself sort of\nI mean it was very clever about their soldiers is something we've talked about before on our program um well it's a form of ... voluntary goal baseball in tears coming here to get small bits of that time and time for them to pick a cooler [noise]\nYeah that's true but people are afraid to come to ...\nThey are able to come and we have a ... poodle thirty to forty two years and she usually there's a couple of Fifteen you know it's not it's not on every day or every ... every day and uh people just love it it's sort of the\nCommunity I suppose was clever about this is you up pooling lots of\nPeople skilled in one place school these individual to have all sorts of different ... Pascal bringing them under one roof\nAnd that's what happens on the hope to actually because if one six I cannot fix it he ... and they learn from each other and this is learning on the job as well\nAnd of course we try to get young people also in\nUm and to get experience transferred to the next generation\nOkay but it's not just this RIMPAC cafe hair in both of them they're all well one's hold over the world from Greece to go on a new way to New Zealand or Spain to South Africa Australia to as much on the list goes on the\nPerson who actually kicked off this whole movement is much Tina ... Martinez said Hi thank you for coming ahead of him\nWhen did oldest star more importantly why did you decide to to kick this off\nWell it started I'm ... years ago and at the time I was a journalist and I wrote about sustainability and most specifically about waste reduction waste prevention at a certain moment I wanted to do more than just write about it\nAnd I wanted to really try to change people's behavior in this respect it's a very difficult thing to change people's behavior will come on to that\nAbsolutely but I thought why do people throw away so many items and\nOne of the reasons is that we no longer make repairs so we don't learn how to do it um do you think it's a skill that we've looked\nAbsolutely yeah in the old days people who were told by their parents that when something breaks you try to fix it and\nTechnique was was simpler then so it was easier to fix\nBut nowadays we no longer learn that we have no tools we have no skills and new products are around everywhere and they're not so expensive so when something breaks down the road to do and you like them is much simpler easier\nThan the road to having something we've had\nHim you talk about the little scaled the people there and have these skills anymore I'm not that she works and depends on two things it depends on as you mentioned earlier on people actually being prepared to bring this stuff and to get it fixed in space and the second thing it depends on\nThe other volunteers for them to kind of gave up that time and do this I'm going to all these are parents of ... where did you find them how do you get in touch with people in the first place if you say the last ... some some people do have\nIn in many people don't nothing all communities my experience is that in all communities there are still some people who do have the skills and the two and a time and who really like nothing\nMore than ... and fixing and they've been doing this for twenty Thirty years in many cases so that's my that's what I realized when and when I first organized suffers repack I say it turned out to be not so very difficult to find these fallen teams because when you talk to people then everyone says\nOh you've got to talk to John he's always thing coming around in his uh\nSharing and you're listening to subject us to incur around and shit I mean we can bring in Chris Lee who's in London Hi Chris you run to RIMPAC campaign roasted nuts ethnic kind but you're right\nAbout Enron and yes whereabouts ten miles from Cambridge\nInterest just tell us you know what you constantly get out of repairing stuff why don't you give up your time\nI think ultimately it's the satisfaction of saying somebody's face when something is men that that they have a strong ... ways that they thought was kind of have to be thrown away but they didn't want to try and so why are they wanted to try and keep being used for as long as\nPossible and I and I think the you mentioned about the sentimental value of of some items that people have post throw it away\nYou know as much as you check the ... still just electronic stuff um someone had gotten right can you hear about your own should there wouldn't be\nA lot of companies from one of the or RIMPAC up as I was doing and a woman ... adult and folk and we worked out that it was a hundred years old and I said trust her to go to school she

it or specifically Nike just did the math Nike's sales are thirty five billion dollars twenty billion is registered outside of the U.S Fifteen billion domestically\nAmong that Fifteen billion two thirds are from consumers under the age of thirty five and if you're under the age of thirty five and\nCan afford a hundred and fifty dollar pair of Nike flying that racers you likely a skew towards a higher earner and maybe dwell in a city which means most likely you lean left\nShow by my calculations they'd probably wrist about one to three billion dollars of business domestically amounts at the high end whereas abroad that twenty billion dollars there are very few people outside of the U.S would argue that the U.S is on the right track and it's doing a good job of handling race relations so\nIn exchange for potentially alienating one to three billion about thirty five billion dollar franchise they strengthen the relationship with thirty two to thirty for going on so distinctive whether you think this was the right or the wrong thing to do it was absolutely the shareholder thing to do so in some Nike just did the math\nIt's interesting it's almost taking a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook you might argue to galvanize urine coal support even if it risks alienating alienating some some on the outside\nThat's right great brand finally decide who they're for but who they are not for and they made a statement here it came across as bald it came across as authentic and genuine and it was just a great trade to potentially upset one to three billion\nDollars of your consumer franchise while strengthening thirty one or thirty three was a fantastic movie Nike has them the move to embrace calling ... will go down as one of the better marketing moves as the last decade\nDo you think that's more broadly true that in the age of social media and the age where people are much more used to kind of shy acting out and perhaps opposing other people that they're being ... kind of more okay then it was\nWell we're all hoping that sports would be kind of this away from politics and it ends up at the last fire wall of politics sports\nHas been breached so there's no escaping it now with Nike was able to do with dominate the headlines and buy some standards or by some estimates garnered somewhere between a quarter of a billion\nAnd three hundred and fifty million dollars in free advertising this to a certain extent is taking up a page out of the playbook of Donald Trump who constantly dominates the headlines with controversial statements\nAnd also big tax that is known for not advertising why\nBecause they don't need to show Nike has gone to a great job hair grabbing the Mike back from other big tech and other consumer companies\nSkilled Galloway here on business daily from the BBC so is this the start of a white a trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor got away suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than splashing out unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we want to take it wider anyway some brands in the u._k. also taken to activism have personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take too much in the founder and chairman of the British pub chain whether spoons\nAs a long time you were a skeptic he came out

successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given the choice like everyone else has to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for a company and decided to campaign that just ...\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another to stick it on your band mats and to decorate your various problems with that message\nWell that's right of course there were a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the foot sea hundred companies\nSigned a lesser saying we'll definitely be better off if we stay in the new\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean it's one thing to go on the media and express your

remember they had just brought this new picnic table onto the yard\nAnd everybody wanted it because it was by the basketball court the black sand on it and they claim to it and the Mexicans were like hey man oh no we want that tape they were literally women to kill somebody for a damn table I was you know mandated to actually get involved so I couldn't actually think for myself\nThen about two years ago he was transferred to stand Clinton just across the Golden Gate bridge inside just passed the gates\nHey there Hi it's nice to meet you back was hasn't gone so far so good now\nSo we just tried to what's called the yard\nThis is going lower yard and the biggest thing that people that visit here looking is the fact that it's racially segregated\nIt show hundreds of men working out hanging out split along racial and ethnic lines you see this in the cell blocks to Jesse shows me his out\nThis is where I live I don't like what's up his roommate from Mexico\nEven into that\nLike um

time\nBut sand Clinton today is still getting more and we had the ... and getting prisoners from different backgrounds to play sports together worked together that was new for Jesse for Fifteen Years he'd only socialized with prisoners with Mexican heritage\nWas like a fish out of water I was uncomfortable because of\nThe camaraderie that there was amongst races when I Would walk the yard it bothered me that blacks whites Mexicans were playing basketball together or that there are playing baseball\nI was like man these guys are out of line he didn't know who to trust one of my ah first neighbors when a guy here in West luck he offered me a burrito one night and that was hungry as hell\nAnd as a black guy and he's offering more real and I said oh no I Can't take this hell no you know I thought it was a set of mind when I got back in the ...\nYou know I started thinking wow\nYou know I'm I'm really hungry I step back out and they looked at me and he says you know it's not like that here you know I started thinking about that\nHe started getting involved and found his place at a newspaper published here this than Clinton is one of the only president newspapers and the country\nSo this is the same point newsroom\nThis is where we spend most of my time seven days a week\nIt's an old warehouse type building computers along one wall and a bit surprising a soap opera with subtitles

with other races\nButtery and Jesse are now really tight\nWhen I first met Jesse that I think I was going to be that close to them no absolutely not right because Jesse these kind of stand off as you know you don't know how to approach Jesse you know you got that stern look I guess is um all the years that he's been incarcerated you know however um\nSince the time that I have known him that brick wall has been coming down slowly but surely and he smiles more he plays more and he even gave me a hug me All right\nJesse says he's been thinking a lot about his childhood his mix of friends back

Goldfinger is a professor of geophysics at Oregon State University in the U.S\nWell liquids section is something it sounds a difficult but it's really something everyone's familiar with when you walk down the beach and you step away from your foot prints and you see them fill up with water that's a sign that that the water table at the water level and sand at the beach is right basically at the surface and so anytime you have that kind of condition\nAnd you shake it with an earthquake the water will tend to rise up as the sand grains settled down and spill out on the on the surface so it raises the water pressure locally near the surface and then if you have\nBeen to a bill to town on that buildings can sink into the sand just as you would think into the sand when you sort of wiggle your feet around on the beach and uh but if you you know buildings can sink into it but\nThey can also slide if that to areas on a on a slope and we've seen that are incredible video of chunks of the town of ... allow sliding downhill\nAnd people can sink into it as well rather horrifying me\nYeah yeah I mean you can try this for yourself any time at a beach with really find them just wiggle around in the sand and you'll be up to your knees before you know it was an earthquake can do the same thing over broad areas and so that so you know it's a significant hazard along a usually a lung river banks or near shore lines are on river delta or places where\nThere's a lot of ... consolidated sediment or on manmade show as well as we shall areas of Beijing as to where it's a that's another of susceptible sort of site\nOn why has it happened before ... do you have to have a high water tables you have to have send in the soil\nWill stand as usual natural constituent but man made ... is a really common way to to do this and so uh in San Francisco in the Nineteen oh six earthquake and in the Loma Prieta earthquake areas of a hill manmade show in this case it with sand and dirt and an old gold rush sailing ships\nLiterally a liquefied and so areas up more than a hundred miles away from the fault failed in those kind of looks like actually failures sort of a very common an earthquake\nIt must be horrific thing to experience in person\nBut I've never experienced I've seen it a little bit I was in the the ... earthquake and I saw happening just a little bit of locally worse than when water was coming to the surface but\nIn a really bad area where a whole section of town like here's this happened in Palau has the ground liquefied underneath it and the whole town chunks of the town were flowing toward them toward the ocean must have been a yeah terrify\nThe aftermath of it must make the rescue operation particularly difficult\nWell yeah yeah it's very difficult because the the soils remains susceptible so it's difficult for people to go in there you can you know I've seen some of the videos from civilized people waiting up to their up to their chest trying to get into places like this but they're much like building collapses in an earthquake they're very dangerous places to try to go into at all because the soils are very poor\nAll the areas in the world that susceptible to us quakes where liquid faction could be a particular problem I've heard the Tokyo could be susceptible\nYeah there are a lot of places in the world like this because a lot of the world's largest cities are built near the coast that's where we build cities because they have ports and transportation facilities and things like this show Tokyo is built at the head of Tokyo Bay and there's a large delta and a lot of fill in that area\nSo Tokyo is a good example than Hoover British Columbia is another good example partially bill on the Fraser River delta so
