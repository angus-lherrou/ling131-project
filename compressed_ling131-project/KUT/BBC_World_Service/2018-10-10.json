you might be drink with Kiki do you love\nThat one everybody loves Drake right\nWell I vote so I thought I thought you agreed to give the love of the awards but clearly no\nNo no it was definitely at Taylor is a lot of people have the spotlight focused on her obviously because\nShe got a little bit of political on Sunday on Instagram you know urging people to vote and telling people who she was going to vote for and why she wasn't voting\nFor certain candidates I'm a solo why Democrat to be clear at her and I actually yeah and and she told them why why you want it to the Democrats and you know Mitch you mentioned issues about you know the gay and lesbian community and racism men and women's rights and so on and so on and so people thought\nWhile she wins tonight she's going to get really political or you know when someone calls on stage at she performs she'll get really political\nAnd she won four awards a lot of people knew she would win awards um but she saved getting political so to speak up for the end of the show the very last award at she want her fourth award that's when she said you know she was so happy to win and AMA because it's voted on by the public\nAnd then she uses that as a segue to transition to the fact that you know what else is voted on by the public\nYou guys that November ... election so make sure you get out there for the midterm elections and your vote it was a real swift quick transition but she got it in there and she didn't say much more so she kept to a very short and sweet but notice how she said that little bit of being political\nTowards the end of the show when she won the fourth toward\nJust does that sort of thing go down whether people will these sort of awards speak just about the songs the costumes the awards\nComes to tailor you know she can really do no wrong what they found is that you know a boat dot org has seen a spike in the number of young people registering to vote immediately after\nA

exactly\nIn my in my view on this program I knew [laughter] right [laughter] and it's a growing so I think she's really lost anyone you know so to speak not anyone too big so to speak of course there'll be a lot of conservative fans and maybe some people possibly from the country music world\nRepublicans that are saying you know they just which celebrities which stay out of politics they said that before and they continue to say it again so yes you are hearing some people say that about ...\n[noise] those so ah before among the performances attribute to like to read to frankly I don't know how that's a return frankly I don't know how that went down\nAnd you know pretty well every everybody loves to read the right everybody loves to read that everybody can tell you there or read the

because\nIt sounded when I'm writing that I actually managed to sink properly about the book I mean I Do it's not I never make notes and sometimes I'll story both things if I Need to keep a bit of a track that life afterlife very little of that when children because I just went with a natural rhythm of it\nBut if you do don't you occasionally reach a point in the rushing but you think you guys

freedom to discover because I think you'd be quiet but what if you were writing something that you knew what was going to happen so Seventy\nSomething structural though I Will maybe make notes about I

[noise]\nFive months ago I contacted mine in California I was on the line with him from Britain\nAnd I wanted to find out more about the games on ... [noise]\nHey that might reduce your in the middle of the creation of ... like a C seasons three now wherever you will see\nWe create privatized X. amount of mail 'em out and we ask people to sit down and record themselves so right now or wait for our late ... playing posted videos we will sit down and watch our on our plate tests video\nAnd I have to cook a lot of rewards for myself for example but I make it through an hour to video or take a shower or go to some I'm sure we get through that what you're going\nTo tell me about your family background\nI grew up in the mid west ah in in the ... my dad no clue bury a big part of my uh exposure to board games as a kid so what games did you play\nWhen I was a kid I play a lot of really dreadful games or early on like Kevin standard bearer monopoly ... and a strict ego and whatnot about other stuff that my grandmother had around her farm house they kept all the games there is this giant say\nThe criminal hit the gangs away\nOr my mom was when the ten kids and in order to keep the games and some civil order they were they were kept in a closet called the safe they add lock that they can [laughter] that was not my memory that we can always go in there and and that's about it so\nCan you paint me a picture of getting in that for the first time [laughter]\n\nWhether that was that you know about a dozen games in there and uh we pull out of a game of risk usually we wouldn't know what we're doing we're just going to step up and in butler wager\nYou mentioned that the gangs will rule ... disorder ... she became ... the way that he approached playing these games ... Europe to find him he would changing them\nYeah I mean ah when I play the ones that the farm out it was a matter of just trying to cobble together to rule\nThat we could have any kind of experience but I got a lot of games at present and I remember the excitement of opening up the box and just the thrill of that the fresh new products and you'd sit down and play it and often it was just dreadful I remember playing one that was loosely based on space invaders\nWell my uncle was pretty instrumental in this I almost fresh memories of working on that particular game with him flipping over the uh\nThe game to game called the theater and it had a little star ships and and things that look very exciting to play with so we looked at port over and we spray painted a British stars on it and a critic some cards and brothers and poker chips and tried to make again about mining asteroids\nAnd contributed ideas but he was he was an artist and very much into making thing and that was kind of contagious\nLooking back who's the creation of the game that the playing\n[noise] oh yeah very much though it was a that was making was the fun of it does it totally crash or does it does it work that little cycle they're like create something and then and poke at it and see you know it was any one coming out with which is pretty engaging right well I think that's I\nThink I'm coming up to my time limit on this line at the moment what did you say would be a great time for me to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nUh let's see we've got to be mentioned\nOn ... on August the past three years we've actually brought a variation this product to such an common interests with people in the evening [noise]\n... we combine about way he was in the creation of print that make like a C season three ... small video from across the last ... fell to think he remembered showers ... has been happening since then\nWhen I when we wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically that means hiring year at the game developer so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better so it's a it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is now it's just about making it better but I certainly will be a story said that the timescale of the year [noise]\nThat's right so each game is a a month\nSo sort of like building chapters out if you're writing a novel\nAnd now that we've got the whole arc of the game figured out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce an anti\nSemite this whole with tens of thousands of people in it will qualities and some railway will begin happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're\nIn a conference room in a hotel at some secret location a plane three seasons three and I'll be watching it with no padding and\nSays a testing was holding them for four hours to share some of the team really struck me\nI'm not ... the one of the things he thinks\nI came was whether any points in the game the players began to look at that funds the next day I asked him about small things on the digital world we increasingly spend all the time and\nI think people are really starting to reexamine them I mean you see a lot of talk about visual addiction and a lot of the larger players really looking at how they can communicate how long you've been on so you can more responsibly interact with social media if people are just\nA spending so much time and feeling like they have to report every moment of their lives or it didn't matter\nYou know especially with things going on with Facebook getting even you know this week we decided valuation plummet you're talking about concerns by say runs from Russia and and the misuse of data yeah I think everybody's kind of like looking at\nAll the different ways that we are being used and are asking themselves you know should we be sacrificing all the data and so much of our time and so much for attention to the company that's basically monetize again\nI think it's really important at the game designer to think about how our interacting with the way people think and and their behavior uh because you know I I wouldn't be respectful of that you know and it'd be cognizant of that\nAs I say there's no communication and one of my first professor said graphic design is behavior modification and that seems crazy but really ultimately it is when you whenever you're communicating something or you're doing interaction design or any of these types of design your goal is actually to to make people behave in a slightly different way and I think that comes with a certain responsibility\nThe things that you learn when you worked in the development of a soft what do you employ any of it in the game she make no mistake citing make people want to get involved [noise]\nYou know it's funny I don't use a whole lot of the techniques for engagement that week explores in software but I Do use the tool set that I use when I'm designing so the Internet design process including all the different types of designed research when it came to usability testing an ethnographic research all\nThat kind of stuff went directly into my head in fact we did a lot of ethnographic research about it's about well how does that look so a Yahoo is actually going to people's\nHomes and see how they worked we saw how they interacted with people on their machine because you learn all sorts of things from their environment um\nAnd from the way they behave it just gave us a much clearer picture then for example bringing them into a laboratory environment whether to an air it's very sterile and you don't really understand sort of the person's situation\nBut if you're trying to develop a new products for people you want to understand how they couldn't their lifestyle\nWhat's been talking about the fact that both gaming allows heat so low Gulf cut away for digital media but really there's a lot of the stuff that you learn feeding into that he's on the game\nYeah that's right I mean like I said all the techniques that I use an industry that design software I commend applied to these off line experiences or said he understand human psychology and behavior and cognition and I'm a graphic design principles and all that sort of thing and applies directly to both software and then four games\nSo it'll be creepy using people's psychology\nWell it's better to know how it works and then do it responsibly then to be poking around in the dark blindly and you know you someone something that works like this is amazing and then you go to town\nOn it and then later on your ... in retrospect wow that was awful you know like wow that really heard a lot of people I Am so I I find it much more more valuable talking there about how some companies\nCompanies are like that but yeah I Know I mean I mean I bought the big ones some of the uh yeah I mean there's a sense of uh I certainly picked up on a sense of bravado where it was sort of like a move fast and break things was a model\nFor a long time and you know I got that from a lot of the companies that were that it was just sort of like it was all about getting eyeballs right away\nAnd you know down the consequences and I know and I think now I'm the industry's growing up a little bit and\nPeople are thinking okay well we need to be a little bit more aware of um you know security and safety and and things like that\nWe speaking about the cheap places the bulls game ... well being really different books the fact is we display different to sign on line and we like to adults I mean the kind of games that you create [noise]\nYeah that's true I think to some extent I mean like the yearly promised with the weapons that you could be anybody right you can be a dog and I want to know and so on I think what we found is that uh if you are yourself you connect with people in a more true way on line and that this whole notion of being anonymous as a lot of pitfalls as well as advantages\nUm in games they create a separate debates separate like people call it a magic\nCircle where you can adopt these other percentage center role playing game you can take on a different character and it's a safe place to do that because we've all agree to the rules of that game [noise]\nDepends on the prototype was talk casually away and it'll keep changing the forward to release\nIn sea thousand in Nineteen it was time for the full games testers to head back to the real world ... ... Greg ... had something to say about that relationship with the online world\nThat three of us work in the film industry and she works in publishing and so like all of us are constantly using our devices to communicate with other people in our fields and\nLike if it's something that's always at the forefront of our New Hampshire we sat here and play for hours of his game tonight and I looked at my phone one to check the time and I write channel\nIn our thirties like taking time out of our Saturday to me that you know like this is just like oh we're ... we're going to go hang out this is a very land Erie and event that we do every like every other weekend that\nThe interaction is everything just there's so much better like I've I've all but stop playing video games\nOh I think we all get Internet and social media for tea and like I'm definitely trying to cut back and not just because I think it unhealthy but it gets kind of repetitive and boring and\nAnd sometimes I mean the Internet as well like shrinks the world that allows you to connect with people who are far away but I think we're always seeking connections\nWe want to try and reach out to as many people as we can but I think a lot of times it's better for our own mental state to stop breaching so much and just calm down\nAnd just be and the momentum and just enjoy yourself in the moment instead of looking for something else that somewhere out you know to be here here now and just enjoy the people who are around here\nWhat do you think these kind of game playing is so popular I Know\nI I don't I Can't explain\nThe phenomenal growth in the industry and it's been growing like ten to twenty percent year every year like like crazy um I Do wonder if people do want some way to kind of connect with each other away from their devices\nMaking a connection is important see it and\nYeah I mean some of my favorite stories or when people talk about how this game really brought me closer to my dad or even just today or a guy came up to me and said\nI'm this really see my marriage you know when they tell you they were like yeah the married yeah yeah and that's not the first time I've heard that are really gotta be close to my wife for today it was the opposite say by Maris\nThe game gave them an experience that they could share together\nI agree that you know helps create this kind of intimacy I mean that's wonderful and makes me feel raining citizen [noise]\nOh\nYou are listening to community supported public radio U.

implemented women's right to divorce\nBut I'm a Muslim men in Copenhagen signing on to this because they know unfortunately\nThere are only two Islamic communities in Denmark and we're one of them who
