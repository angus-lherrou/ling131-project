create a three D. images to plan it up to three hundred Columbus is below the surface the aim is to help the mining industry find precious metals the baby spill message is in Sydney Hi Phil um how would this telescope look\nThis is a virtual telescope that would allow scientists to peer into the hidden interior it would bring together\nMuch of the information science has about the deep state to from science make waves prove prove that produced by earthquakes for example information about the electrical conductivity if the sub surface of the planets samples of belt style by volcanoes alone without the computer simulations\nAnd experiments all of this information would be brought together the aim is to create to treat the image of watts font beneath our feet some professors sewer Riley she's from the Australian Academy of science and she says the technology would give an accurate picture as to what lies beneath\nThe surface of the planet\nWe can ... geology and the interior of the

from the Australian Academy of science that are providing it doesn't ... who would benefit from it [noise]\nWell the scientists talk about targeted exploration as we hug professor a righty describe as of minerals and resources finding ... there'll be time consuming\nAnd expensive and it's hoped that this virtual telescope would ... much of the guests can provide more accurate indications as to whether the bouncy lives there is a global shift towards mobile technology renewable energy and electric cars\nAnd according to Australia and scientists this will involve a huge increasing demands ...

... to that cobalt\nIs a key components in those lithium ion batteries that power electronic devices and electric cars\nThere's also a backlash to the mining of cobalt in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo to mining and generally in many places because of environmental impacts\nAnd so on is it possible that that will be a people objecting to this sort of a developing this telescope\nWas estimated that there are more than three hundred companies around the world now actively searching for fresh deposits of coal bolts and some of the opposition\nLives on how this particular chemical is extracted so Australian scientist believe that if this virtual telescope gets the go ahead and he's a developed that it would provide more targets eights exploration so you wouldn't have the the random digging gig digging up all exploring\nUp for this particular resource but the mining in Australia like elsewhere is a very very lucrative and the industry is very very powerful so yes that that may be all position but one would imagine that the weight of science in economics that will come to bear into these sorts of projects so will be a\nA will be promoted by those who favor them\nAnd how like flea or when is it likely to be out of that and that could\nWell this is all part of a ten year plan that he's being championed by the Australian Academy of science it was set up in Nineteen fifty for same is to promote science and science education and also these at Grand designs of promoting\nThis virtual telescope they could be up and running\nWithin ten years according to various scientists than it is positive that ten year plan it also recognizes this plan deficiencies in Australia is Education Network saying that geosciences largely absent from school so the aim is to create a new generation of scientists\nSo that that if this telescope but dust coming to come into being there will be scientists\nTo know how to work it so much that thank you very much

I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a politician to use a word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true [noise]\nThe comments there from President Trump on the case of ... meanwhile on Sunday evening the Saudi king said ... called the Turkish president at Richard type or do I want to discuss the disappearance of the Saudi journalist I spoke earlier to the BBC's mark flowing in Istanbul\n... among spoke to president that on on Sunday night chime in and said that no one will undermine the strength of the Turkish Saudi relationship and stressed that a\nSociety where you wanted to form a joint working a joint commission of inquiry with tax to look at the ... G A disappearance um but I ... that has been sort of hardening of the message from the Turkish government in the last couple of days I mean the foreign minister hit\nHim ever traveled shoulder said that I'm a techie wants more cooperation from the Saudis the Turks are frustrated for example that\nThe ... the police such that they want to carry out of the Saudi conceal it has not happened because the Saudis have tried to limit the scope of such the texture example wanted to use 'em at a chemical that would\nThat would uncover blood stains in the country that if there were any uh Saudis and not allow that reportedly they where they wanted the audio visual such so even though the tax government has to be more cautious than the kind of leak that we've seen over the last ten days or so we um alleging premeditated murder and\nI just minimum dismiss them into the ... uh I think you're seeing a gradual hardening of the positions and attacked as much as they are getting frustrated that this is well taken several\n... which is which is also really interesting because then what how does this investigation have this joint investigation have if even when king sound that speaks to president or do we still you know on the ground as you say there's still quite hardened positions\nYes I mean it is a big question it it'd be like him to for example if President Trump would open a\nJoint cyber inquiry with Russia I mean the Saudi Government is alleged to have committed a premeditated assumption assassination here\nSo it is bizarre in a sense of the ... joined inquiry but I think what it showing is that on the face of it at least the ducks are trying to kind of tried casually with Saudi Saudi Government mindful of his important diplomatic relationship while still leaking incriminating evidence\nThrough the pro government media every day to sort of builds the international support and to build the case of other\nCountries um to to to backup tacky and his master\nThe BBC's mark flowing in stumble\nSpokes on the bike on business it's a a course a policy are we going to talk about German elections now bad night\nFor the sea su that's just the the largest policy in this area is read this area for the past ... years more uh and they are in coalition ... a policy at a federal level a now they've lost votes to smaller policies\nIncluding the far right after the ... green policy which isn't much of the second strongest policy in Bavaria how big a shift is this a will end up threatening the current government that speak to a spokesperson for the Green Party a sports person on Europe ...\nWho joins us now a front of the story that we've been hearing a lot from Germany is a ... migration which was damaged ... who has helped the AFC in the far right but can you tell us what is helping you the greens do well in the situation\nAs a good morning\nHelped us first of all hum than we give answers to the real problems people face and the very end and Germany beat a lack of affordable\nHousing a beat the lack of\nUm real action on climate change the it to child poverty a and yes we have all the answers for asylum migration but we did not solely focused on that issue and if you look at the exit polls um and ... you know it was really interesting to see\nThat the number two issues like people left this is who didn't vote for any more was to say speak only of migration and I'm the second reason unless they are in fighting and that's the second biggest had in fight\nContinuously over the last couple of years\nRight now that's interesting what you say about migration an although obviously you don't want just to talk about that as a site for so long we've been talking about that is the dominant the sort of the defining issue\nAmongst Germans votes is you have a broadly sympathetic more open borders attitude towards migration all you're saying but that doesn't damage you with German voters\nObviously didn't um and I believe that you know it's\nA ... who is continuing to meddle with people like Audubon with people who are building in jeopardy the European project who are putting in Japanese liberal or order of our democracy that they are continuing to lose and we have been really clear in that ... that we're not getting out of ...\nOkay I'm a ... and another thing I mean often when people want to move away from a you know if if they think that the the central right policies of being a little bit obsessive about one issue than natural home one would have thought would be sent to left a speedy why have people come to the greens are not the traditionally one of the largest Maltese\nYeah you know this is my eyes of the social democratic party secretary of it's not just and German and um but uh I Believe it's\nBecause of a you know they have not been clear on this question of migration and you're put in an acting wavering and I think any party these days who is not clear where they stand for a liberal open society\nWhich is a position that's all you've been saying quite clear\nAnd you know those when\nAlso those who are completely opposed that as the by those party in the center would not deciding which side to stand down right a little\n[noise] okay so you've been brave you ... the uh the advantage one question I have to us we were speaking to somebody an analyst a little bit earlier or about you'll very good showing in Missouri and she Robert ... said I'd like to know what their policy on diesel engines is and how that's going to go down\nA very huge center of the car industry um how are they going to respond to green successes in a in Bavaria\nThe car industry has had a very nice easy right with the current government and then a ... a public transport minister who comes from that area um you know because they have been cheating happened not meeting the targets and they want consumers to pay to pay for it and we have been a closing that they meant a and I\nThink that they are realizing that it's no longer possible\nJust to give an easy ride the car industry to have to catch up they have to meet the standards and cheating or is that All right\nVery interesting to talk to a congratulations on your

I'm very well remembered\nA hearing for Clarence Thomas to get through his nomination to get on to the Supreme Court was extraordinarily painful and contentious and here we are\nHowever many years I guess twenty seven years later watching another extraordinarily painful and contentious a Supreme Court nomination ferocious unfold what is the direction of travel with your experience been on your observation of what happened now\nWhat do you feel well you know it's interesting that you should ask that I'm here in Philadelphia because just last night I was on a panel with Anita Hill and we were talking about precisely that what do we make of\nTwenty seven years later the fact that this issue is still being presented in many of the same ways to the same and you\nKnow I ... and and with all things there's one has to look at both what has gotten better and what has not I think what has gotten better um is the idea or at least the recognition that these\nUm claims have to at least a appear to be taken more seriously than they were taken twenty seven years ago so we were able to see that and and the way for example that Dr Palese for was a\nQuestion not by an all white male Judiciary Committee\nA but a bi racial Mitchell on I think there was a recognition that the optics were important\nI think there was a recognition on the Democratic side as well one of the differences that I noticed between what happened with Anita Hill and Dr Blasey Ford is it the Democrats in this instance were very clear that they saw the allegations as a credible\nThey saw her as credible and they want it to us from her that's not what happened with Anita Hill even the Democrats more or less as I said a left her hanging out to dry so there is a recognition that these are very important issues and and\nUh they can't be dismissed on the other hand that the end game is pretty much the same\nUm and I as I look at what we learned a two weeks ago\nIs that a woman still have to run the ... of credibility she still has to show a appropriate level of of trauma she has to be truthful um she she can't be overly um resentful or angry\nAnd and Dr blazing for was able to do that so most of the commentators even on um Fox TV that leans a to a supporting a President Trump everybody was saying\nThis is a very very grave situations very very serious so it was a testament to her credibility you are\nA civil rights activists and you're also a feminist as well as close to a law professor you've written a lot about into sexuality and the different themes of oppression on how they work sometimes\nIn concert sometimes in different ways and how people need to be aware and react to learn to put it bluntly do you think America found it easier to relate\nTo the issues raised by Dr fooled causes of white woman when they found it to relate to everything that Anita Hill raised where she was a black woman complaining about sexual harassment from a black man\nI absolutely think that\nA race has a lot to do with credibility I think that\nThey were a both white ... both elite\nUm that she was seen as more credible more reliable\nAnd that's the part of the story that is a reflection about racial differences both and the stereotypes that women carry with them and their ability to be bullied at the end of the day it's it's more or less that it just didn't matter\nUm so yeah she might need to lead to name Susan Collins who was who cast in many ways the deciding vote said that she believed her she believed that the trauma that happened\nUm she didn't necessarily believe she was remembering correctly that it was judge Kavanaugh who did it and at the end of the day what ever happened to her didn't really matter a in judging a the the qualifications of a judge Kavanaugh\nUm so I I think at the end of the day what we see here is is what I sometimes call you know this curses a cemetery she had to do a lot to be credible and even when she did all that\nThe burden basically shift at the hands and there was virtually nothing he could do a\nWould have destroyed his credibility if that performance that we saw in including a loss of temp are a\nTo Democrats if all of that wasn't enough to undermine his credibility one wonders shorter coming in and throwing themselves on the ground and say I did it I did it\nOr whether anything would have allowed a Christine Blasey Ford to prevail so it really is a recognition that there's a huge gap between what men can do and get away with and what women can do to action being taken seriously\nYeah or I should just articles that Brett commoner denies all those obligations and\nThat was a scene throughout the the hearings but but here's the the the basic question I happy because your analysis of the way society works and you'll\nGo work on this is what you call into sexuality it's it's become extremely influential across America but would it be fair to say that you see\nThe the key components in society in America today as being ... rather than individuals who is that a fair reflection of how you see things\nWho is senior business and banking tickets have pulled out of an investment conference to take place in

September two thousand and teen and not date significant because that's the date that Syria was had had meant to declare and destroy all of that chemical weapons\nAnd then a hundred and sixty four what we did as we use evidence by Nineteen impartial organizations and we cross checked all this evidence\nAnd what we could find that was strong evidence to say a chemical attack has happened we listed that attack and when so in the end we found a hundred and six attack so we feel very confident they did take place\nAnd what was the evidence was at video evidence was it an actual analysis of soil samples that kind of thing\nIt varied depending on the organization but most of it yes is either visual evidence I Witness testimony something that has that been taken from the ground and also um analysis of the symptoms some of the victims showed that who are that in the area at the time that attack happened\n... says it's a false that's what he says this is all just ...\nAnd that's exactly why this investigation will still important I mean some of the disinformation and they can use that has come out of you know stories like this has made people cost out on what was going on in Syria and so that's what we felt it was so important to use the evidence that is available\nTo kind of try and prove and what is actually going on and how many chemical attacks that have happened you know the Syrian Government has made incredibly difficult for mechanisms like the OPEC W and the joint investigative mechanism that has the mandate from the UN to investigate these sorts of attacks to do that job\nAnd so we felt it was very important to highlight the extent of the situation and what was going on on\nThe obesity W that is the un watchdog for chemical weapons to prevent use of chemical weapons what are we talking about in terms of chemicals all these things like chlorine which are readily available or are we talking about much more complex chemical weapons and a nerve agent so\nWhat we saw was actually the ... and two of that tax the cell phone must it uh and these attacks have already been proven to be done by ice and the so called Islamic state\nSeventy nine attacks with chlorine and this was really important because it also helped us kind of understand the strategy behind why these chemical weapons we use\nChlorine is a very ... chemical it sinks deep underground\nAnd it was a strategic to use chlorine because you know many people had sheltered deep underground from the conventional bombing and so when they hit with chlorine there were forced to come out of the underground shelters that they were hiding in and that's one of the main reasons that people ended up fleeing after these attacks took place\nAnd we also so some sign attacks one of the sign attacks was the one in ... which was reported widely that killed over eighty people and and that sign attack was the last sign attack it was also proven that the government was responsible for this attack because the sign use was from the same stockpile\nThat I'm a PC W was my top destroyed in two thousand adapting\nHow'd you find that so they see they investigate the ... the chemicals that we use to make their salary and and they found that one of the protests of chemicals match exactly the same sort of chemical that they found in the shuttle assets possession in two thousand and that\nThis is clearly an affront to international law it's ignoring the demands that have been made in the past the so called red lines that have been drawn do you suppose that the evidence you're presenting will change much\nI think there has been lots of evidence pictures before that has been very bold and very evident that the shuttle is it has been using chemical weapons time and time again and yet the international community hasn't really reacted and and I didn't see that they will react anytime soon now\nNow while I'm a Gadhafi who helped with that investigation on the BBC kind of drama program which will be available on line this is wild update [noise]\nBritish Government sources of told the BBC Brexit negotiations of hit to quote a real real problem with the issue of the Northern Ireland border it's understood central info the reassurances being sought by the U.S with the so called Northern Ireland backstop an arrangement to be put into place to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland\nAnd Ireland and the event that there is no trade agreement reached between the u._k. and the ... speaking to the BBC Ireland's ambassador to the u._k.
