I Would characterize as being\nConscience stricken about the larger impacts of their work\nAnd they have a range of strategies to reconcile themselves to the implications of that for their own conscience one of the the ways that they dealt with it was to encourage their clients to donate to charity to offset the negative impact of depriving the state of revenues\nOther people I interviewed including one gentleman and in Panama City said he would actually lecture his clients on the theory and practice of inequality in the world\nAnd he would point out to them that is they sat in his office in Panama City\nA couple of miles away people were living in cardboard shacks and had no access to clean drinking water and what is the client think about that\nThat that may see mild but it's fairly risky strategy to pursue and you know frankly most wealth managers are replaceable um if you find one a little too or in your face you could always go get another one or get another one within a different company\n[noise] I think a lot of people have impressions of the lives of the very wealthy and imagine what life must be like when you're driving around in a private plane and being waited on by service stuff all the time and I'm Wondering in your conversations with wealth managers whether\nAny of your own assumptions are beliefs about the connections between wealth than happiness were either confirmed challenged\nI was struck by a man I spoke to in the channel islands who talked about how suspicious wealthy people are [noise] it jibes with some things that I've seen personally and what he said was when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you\nIt's like what happens to lottery winners all sorts of so called relatives come out of the woodwork asking for loans asking for help us some sort con artist come out of the woodwork looking to get a piece of you\nBut that's what happens throughout the lifetime of wealthy people and so it breeds of kind of suspicion why do you want to be my friend why are you being nice to me or you just trying to get me give you something and you can see how that would lead at the extreme to a sort of\nHoward Hughes in retreat or isolation from people because if you can't trust anyone why bother I mean the sad thing but you're saying is that\nThe wealth manager might end up being perhaps among the very few people that it rich person can trust\nYeah I think that seems to be a common story it's wealthy people and their service it almost comes to the point where you can if you're wealthy person you are more trusting of the people you pay to be in your service than the people you don't pay because\nWith your family you might have sort of a a King Lear problem you know which of my children actually loves me and which are out to get something from me\nBut at least ... when you are having a transactional relationship with\nAn employee at least the boundaries there are clear you're paying them for certain services and you can assess whether they're giving you the services that the standard you require if they're not you fire them if they're doing a good job you keep them on there is a simplicity to that that is not present in emotional relationships\n[noise]\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark she's the author of the book capital Without Borders wealth managers and the ... percent broke I Want to thank you for talking with me today thank you [noise]\n\nThis episode of hidden brain was produced by Jenny Schmidt Renee ... arena Cohen Maggie Penman\nSlow economy Chris bender F\n... show and lower court out it was edited by ... team includes Thomas flew a coming of our best Restrepo you could find more hidden brain on Facebook\nAnd Twitter and listen for my stories on your local public radio station if you'd like to seven showed please make sure you'll subscribe to our walk at at least one friend\nWho might enjoy the show I'm not going to be not to see you next week\nSupport for hidden brain comes from the Rockefeller Foundation this is NPR\nSupport for NPR comes from ... and from universal pictures presenting the new film burst man from Damien ... director of la la land and whiplash and starring Ryan\nEverywhere for him feeders and Iraq's October twelve and from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging\nScience and the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misuse and eugenics crusading premier in October sixteenth on PBS Morehead flown out or\nYou are listening to Austin NPR station K.

[noise] favorable arises I suppose as a climate change\nThat's kits Kovacs that well the changes due to climate change or all the is on the global public may need some convincing but\nThe new region public from what I panel have been saying\nUh quite conscious of the environment this is a country that sees itself as as being quite green there recycling bins everywhere she something I've noticed as you mentioned the cells and electric cars are going up thoughts let's talk about how to facts not ease new way on pocket to meet its targets\nAgreed under the Paris climate change agreement and twenty fifty as anybody knows about that\nThere is a carry\nThe shore towns that do that is no and that's actually something that we've been debating in the parliament that the past couple of days as well because ... is right now I think it's important that we realize that we're not on track towards reaching that that targets\nAnd also that we don't have any significant plan that's Abed his hair mentioned to how to reduce our climate guessing missions in Norway it's important to understand that the climate policy in Norway over the past Twenty years has been mainly policy on how to reduce ... emissions abroad\nAnd a lot of the work that we've been doing now that life saving the rain forest it's been great but it's also in a way to sort of postpone the transition that we need to do in Norway and postponed really tough choice is and how to reduce our climate get some and ships can\nGoodman center of the public in a sense being sold a bit of a a green wash us a puppet note that green off for oh\nI Will disagree or two cups care about that we don't have a plan I mean seriously we have debated a plan in the parliament and uh we have also a reduction of a steel tool in the atmosphere we have ah as I told a fifty percent electric cars to\nA part of the plan of the taxes for cars I mean we haven't Ciro Texas if you buy a electric car but if you buy a car with the cost of fuel it's full taxes\nSo for example does is the active policy\nAnd we have to also take into account up this is a global issue so some of the export of oil and gas is also part of the words so do you have to shut down the coal plants they are more loosening and making the problems I mean Norwegian ... can be part of the sort of ...\nBecause no region gases clean up but if you think about ... new way could do given that it's wealthy what shifted to ... ... can it do get some of these tests should new way innocence be able to make more choices because of the wealth that enjoys\nWe have to do a look at the same time on many different levels and if anyone tells you this is a magical ... as you can do one thing and then it will be sold\nThat's not true because there's a lot of things to do you have to do energy efficiency you have to do\nMore renewables you have to replace coal would gas like in the u._k. they could use energy for the first twenty four hours last year without the lump of coal because of the region guess that was disillusioned for them and of course the most is Louis\nForever but it is a solution on the way it will take time it will take decades but we're going in the right direction and we have to go on ...\nThere is I don't really think we're going to the right direction they discuss that oil and gas policies I guess we continue with business is your shoulders to political consensus amongst the biggest part is that we will maintain high production levels and we actually subsidize the expiration and uh\nThe longer we continue with the businesses to show the harder it will need\nTo go and get a wave a magic wand and put you in charge you said there isn't a plan what should the ...\nWell I think we should start taking part of the international\nDebates about how much more oil and gas and they can put into the atmosphere because if they burn all the research they know about now it reaches almost three degrees so everyone has to take responsibility here and I think the challenge for the government and for the oil industries to first of all run the company in a way to the benefits\nOf ah the owners which is the states with a dinner and the government also needs to be in tune with what the people are thinking and that many of the plan for how we can get off\n... feels so I think there was a division now for the first time in our fifty years of experience with oil that the the public sector for example we don't want to Seventy percent in the north\nSixty percent totally in Norway says we don't want to open the most\nVulnerable areas in the north that are flippant areas and the ... also have polls showing that people are willing to the oil in the ground for climate reasons kind of good and it's a\nI think we're missing a a major part of the energy world energy a debate here because the biggest problem is the large number of coal plants out in the world looks at China for example and uh the CEO to any since they don't know any national borders\nSo we have to look on a on a great state and I mean that's since the legion oil and gas is one of the most green once produced in the world one of the country such shouldn't stuck with this should be no way because that\nSpecific point that that brings up if you think about that has been a big public outcry in this country about this idea\nThat the ... islands is very important environmental area in the nose have no way could be opened up to ... really important to marine life important too but that's something that has made the Norwegian public wakeup perhaps the cost of oil to this country\nYeah that's a very uh special area on the whole Silicon Valley is\nOf course so do you think the tipping point as far as public opinion can said no I mean it's ... it's a nice you know because we have a political platform\nOther government where we have to agree to let this area and be less of it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the is actually part of making a Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hundred power is one tenth in energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and I'm just relaxing sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced\nCarry this this cat's he is not to view that shaped by much the Norwegian public that actually that should that Norway does is we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out the new from the ground and where the good guys and all\nOf this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame myself as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the ... seat in the ...\nA quote in Chicago has convicted a white police officer ... black teenager in twenty fourteen Jason Van Dyke shot liquid

extent ... well that money is going on that this is a rich country\nIn this tough I Want to think more clearly about the plan which you've alluded to if nobody's going to abandon selling fossil fuels is serious about climate change and how it might do that\nNow the government's connected to legally binding emissions reduction talk it the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by age to Ninety five percent of Nineteen Ninety levels and the same time\nHoff the value of this country's exports have good comes from oil and gas I left an Elvis tuned who's noise environment minister\nCredentials tarnished by the fact that they're making an awful lot of money from exposing fulfill feels\nThe need to be in front and taken into use suicide missions solutions that are doing the transportation sector I mean sending more electric cars than anywhere else last month of ... a close to fifty percent of the folks but at the same time\nYou know the oil and gas industry will become smaller park or economy in the future and so we must also have a policy for having a green\nShift we've been ... looking at the hydroelectric power plant that this is part of this project that led to Norway being dumped the green ...\nThe idea that this country can store power that generates elsewhere in Europe and then send it back when supply from other sources sticky unpredictable renewable slumps how realistic is that\nYou didn't realistic for us to have the power here also wind power to park them with the European system so we are building become actors most was Germany ... England so let's we become part of it if our resources are large enough\nTo become the ... for Europe I think that is most us realistic only this summer to how the drought we'll be old from needed to import electricity from all the ... this is really into going back to the power will flow both ways\nDo you think the way in which no way has written if you'd like to who says you've convinced public opinion cities is a good thing to keep this oil and gas industry it's bringing in a lot of money but at the same time you've managed to convince people that switching to hydroelectric power is a good thing where a green country we care about the environment\nHow long do you think you can maintain that writing those two very different horses\nWe are and they're really Harvey ... such as for the world to reach the purse agreement goals we have to make major changes to the next four eight twelve years so we really how to do carbon us the U.S marshals society as we kind of false as we can\nBut it's not really see that that isn't being challenged as it\nIt is a strategy for lowering emissions but it's also a strategy for a social change on an economic change is\nMultiple their moral question is really about the hard policy so how do we deal with climate change at the same time as we shift our economy to how the competitiveness also in the future\nThat the environment and his to or not Elvis too and he's in a hurry can fly on here\nWell I think we are all in a hurry but we have to be able to how to talk to had at the same time I don't think it's ... I mean if we are going to electric cars and the industry don't deliver our demands well should we not drop out of all them\nThey're interested in your view on into connect to these cable so I saw the site where this cable is getting together stopped and killed all in the southwest it goes all the way to the north east England and it's going to allow a new way and the u._k. to produce and store access green energy\nIs this in a sense son is ... new ways images a bit of a green pioneering getting away from some of the criticisms that you've level about his role as a fossil fuel ...\nMay be I think it's really good for us that we are connected to the rest of Europe because then we can\nActually develop more renewables because they have this amazing coastline would love to win and there's so many ways that you can develop also for example solar power you can make as much as you can do it in Germany because it's cold and it's not polluted\nSo I kinda wanna bring attention to the way that we have been thinking about energy\nWe haven't really seen the impact the hydro power and we haven't seen that oil platforms so I think one challenge now is that you have to think about the way the use of energy\nAnd the way we develop energy and that's actually if we want to be part of the Europeans illusion than actually making more renewable energy can be one of the answers to where we could put our money and that I was\nGay and when you talk to people hear about the idea of Norway sharing that power\nPeople all worried about it they're worried about some of the environmental impact if you increase small areas just over the past that worried that the ... they're going to pay it can go up which suggests that people in Norway adjusted worried about their own pocket has anybody anywhere else even if you're trying to save the world\nOf course they are concerned about if it's going to cost more and if it's going to cost more to\nUse your electricity we've been blessed with a coastline that has given us a lot of energy in different forms over a lot of years and that has made it possible but remember we're not really new hydro power in a way we have a lot of discussions about women parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we are putting out there\nSo it's not that easy to just shift and there's also another concern that's huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion above your work about where you live you go to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of coal son now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of the food production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company here are the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at together with the communities and the company is how we don't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think these kind of way of creating viable energy futures is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for that energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should find certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to hack into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he wanted to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security as of supply will come from renewable notes to develop new pipelines with gas\nHad like all these things going on in the Senate which made us able to set all the premises for our oil development so they can't really model that and that also challenge just normal now to be sort of a new norm entertainer\nSo if we said if we listen to the economists to say that if you actually bring down supply you bring down demand for ... and that this is\nA responsibility for that feels producers to think about than I think uh we could actually kind of lead the way and thinking about how uh just transition could take place and manage decline game\nShould anybody lived in a way for lessons 'cause it's a problem as we said that doesn't respect Buddhist\nI think that the main lesson from Norway is a historical left because it is a lesson above the national resources are\nThe societies ownership we we own the natural resources together so that tells us that Walter ... higher power or oil and gas fish whatever is it's a common property and that is what you made it possible and we'll make\nIt possible for us to evolve into the future with offshore mining would off water offshore wind or whatever so the natural resources are common property that is the main lesson to learn\nSo then I think we will have a lot of people working in this sector for a lot of years and I'm I'm Glad that Barry institution not only\nEducate people to work and renewables but also educate them to work in order and gas because we need them in a lot of years to\nCome so let's think about that time scale we have touched them time scales a bit in a sense to wrap up if you're thinking ten years ahead how much dependence do you think that will be in New ways economy either directly through selling oil and gas or indirectly job's education whatever\nOn oil and gas ... where do you think Norway will be in ten years time Kent\nIn ten years time well I don't think it will be a major\nDifference in how we we run society still forty fifty percent of your ... in in ten years time yeah I think the perspective of has to be more like twenty Thirty years then it will probably have less oil and gas impact in the economy because you have to have to change\nThe Grinch shift is coming I think then technology will have developed so much that it will be going in that direction gradually so yeah\nThere is so a bit of ... about the role it technology might play but a belief that oil and gas will still be a very big part of the Norwegian economy\nIn ten years well I think production is declining overall and I think that ah we're not finding enough oil and gas so I think if we're going to happen by itself that people even though the projections that it will keep going until at least twenty she will be some sudden increase that's not the protections I Would say if you look at the\nExpected production of oil and gas in Norway\nIs that it's tilted should three that they keep going up and then it type of something like that\nWhen I think that ... has probably reached the peace now and then get gas for the ... yeah the one and expect that that wouldn't be more gas resources to be found so\nThat mean that question here would be should we estimation politicians allow for the also the petroleum the gas industry to develop new fields for the future and that's something I Would argue against but that that would be a political question\nAnd and that political question how hard is it then for you is that what you're going to campaign on to persuade people that they might give up some of that job security some of their economic security within a decade that's not very long\nNo it's not very long and and I mean that's something that we've been advocating for quite some time now in off the that the price cell of so much as it did in two thousand and fourteen I think the ... site it became more\nTo how vulnerable we are today oil industry and how dependent we are so I see now she's in mentality I think and then we just turned ... do you believe that art and gas industry will be there for quite some time\nBut it wouldn't have seen that okay we should be relying on the industry says well we should be developing other industry said industry is as well and we should try to find new ways of living that would also help the world that find solutions to the climate the to the climate problem\nThere is a crisis could be the answer then yeah I think we're seeing now with like a warm summer because in our lives it sort of had the expectation that it will get a bit warmer I Will be good for farming et cetera\nThat we haven't really ... the effects of climate change so more often you know you're not abrupt change that makes a things changed and you actually plan for it but we can't really hope for a climate crisis for Norway to to react\nGay uh ... the climate crisis that an economic crisis might change the timescale within which ... considers its dependency on on oil and gas and he is how\nHow we ... we have to remember the last Eighteen years we we reached peak oil in two thousand miles away so we have ... production of oil from the last eight years so we're really natural gas producer that's the main thing we're producing and\nThe predictions I see I come see the the one that just shutting off the lights on the shelf is born yet\nSo you do you think it's going to be another lifetime at least ... but then what does that make me ... look for new ways rolled in that particular debate but\nAlso started up what you have to do a lot of things at the same time you can use carbon capture and storage you can use energy efficiency you can use gas to switch from coal there is a lot of possibilities\nCarry Afghans right you've you've ...\nWell we all lost escape is right that that would mean that the world has not been able to handle\nClimate change and we're looking at three to four degrees yes it is and and I would strongly insist on that we need to shift the economy and the global economy away from from oil and gas off the twenty fifth day so it's really a question of of time here that's\nWhy I've come back to this is a political question because the ... resources to state and they're going to be there but we need to take this as a political question\nThere is not a lot so hopeful ah for the oil industry in terms of economics at guide I think actually that we will have the shift sooner rather than later that renewables will have a bigger role can she wants to come in\nYou know I mean of course that will be more renewables but also the road we'll requests more energy so that we have to look contact question as well so uh I'm a I'm On line with the good hitter yeah I think the uh we'll we'll have a lot of natural gas in the mix or in the near future and in the long term as well\nAnd it will be necessary to meet the Grinch\nNotion loss of agreement on the real story this week thank you very much to a gas tank you to ... ... ... ... ... and

I mean you you mentioned the international community or the comments themselves out just inside Bangladesh whose responsibility is it to change that situation you are\nWell I mean I think the Bangladesh government has shown a degree of generosity towards these people but I think that is changing or as opposed to it from the ground becomes more sense in which a Ninety to ... ... with any country that has had a large influx of people suddenly come up with that but what is\nThis going to be a sense of resentment\nAnd this has happened before as well this is this is not an isolated incident I had been reading a crisis in the seventies and the nineties\nAnd and in this case it says the degree of pushback and documented by ... at the time I'm all in the sense in which the camps who may become particularly dreadful to that people would leave\nAnd I think that the Bangladesh government needs to have more international support and when I spoke to aid agencies in the ground to the the problem is when you were in a refugee camp in the middle east\nOr it's flat it's a ... that they're off you know it's it's a desert and in some parts and this is very these very hard to get to that room in mountainous regions it's built up and you have to get out and walk on a ... to to the camps themselves off in three Patty fields\nAnd so getting medical equipment that getting that food and supplies that it's incredibly difficult and say it just it's a logistical nightmare\nEmma Hogan and Patricia ... in the studio with me or listening to weekend from the b._b._c.

I think what's new is like you know the kind of\nCoordinated accusations\nAre it is quite surprising given the level of the Russians sophistication that they were called ...\nBut I Believe you know when the uh intelligence agencies from different countries they come together and they ... you know a a sister had an investigation altogether that gives them you know like your best to uh put them in a better place to be able to achieve results and therefore we saw what we saw a a yesterday\nAnd what does this tell you about the scale of water might be going on behind the scenes you\nWell I mean if you look at a where the Russians are attacks have taken place you know they've uh went to a game like organizations in uh in Canada and the U.S and met Asian Brazil and with that land and and on the Netherlands and the\nUK so they've been keeping everyone quite busy\nAnd I that basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how uh how much like fibers do is now are very much\nAnd essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a foreign policy agenda and they use it quite at all and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts on I deal with

economy [noise]\nThat's all coming out here on this edition of weekends off to the latest international [noise]\n\nDon't think this damages the court I think this damages the process of the Senate\nBut actually I think that they redeem themselves this week by looking at the evidence sitting in the FBI looking at the investigation this was one of the longest nomination process for Supreme Court that we've ever had\nThat was very vitriolic it was hostile lots of conflict but it was also judicious\nAnd you talk about the lentils approaches to see some of questioned whether the FBI investigation has been sufficiently rigorous and has been actually completed sufficiently\nThey have what people don't understand is that actually judge Kavanaugh has been investigated by the FBI six times this with the seven all the interviews that the FBI would have done had already been done they didn't need to repeat the interviews if there is any kind of\nEdition or changes than it would have been perjury on the part of the people going for the Senate so they didn't want to get to the tuition where they had to reverse what they said it was actually probably better that they didn't go to the FBI the FBI just took all the interviews that were already done as their investigation\nThey interviewed all the witnesses who were supposed to be the corroborating evidence\nThey found no cooperation among those witnesses to ... already been stated by the accusers and they presented that evidence to the Senate\nWould fund the about professor Christine Blasey Ford who gave evidence evidence that was described by the president among others as compelling that was an issue view of it it was very emotional people praised for having the courage to come forward and see what she did\nWhere does this leave her there wasn't\nLong because her evidence wasn't compiling at all because she had no clue operating I think what people were being sent to the table or her motions her emotions were a\nCompelling but emotions are emotions they aren't what we decide law on and which isn't what we decide guilt or innocence on I don't think anyone would want their guilt to be determined by someone's emotions on the facts and that and again at the end of the day it was about facts\nD.C McAllister conservative commentator in the U.S on the bench in the Senate and my husband picked up on that last point about a duck to fool the evidence she gave on the left as far as D.C McAllister is concerned of courage\nI think it's Sunday disingenuous to just focus on the allegations um you we may never knew what happened to six years ago with is actually ...\nI think what we do know is Kevin O's and his testimony how emotional it was and I think that that has not been enough to fix this debate he was not pastas on this and he's you being interviewed for a job which is meant to be part of that\nHe himself and spent a couple of years ago saying that if you ... and if it ... the Yankees match wearing stripes I the Yankee uniform you'd be worried\nThat his role is meant to be politically neutral ... and I think he came across as an absolute the opposite of that\nBecause he would give up the pressure that one political scientist poodle\nThat you don't get that but I think he he really went off the Democrat and I think that you know it's it's it's understandable if someone has been accused and its innocence to be angry at will do I as I saw in the new companies saying ... if a woman has to be as angry I don't know whether she would have got such a good response\nPatricia ...\nOkay I'm going to be not try and be nice common balance among his um again you can't prove what went before I did believe lazy for simply because I don't know of a woman my age who hasn't had a traumatic experience of of of that from the um but the way that he conducted himself an as an outsider just watching it\nWas not accept it was ... it was hysterical it was just\nI wouldn't want him to be um having anything to do with making the nose of the country and not entirely that's just based on watching\nBut he's since retracted as me and said that there was something to the testimony that he shouldn't have said or at least the the most\nWins a judge and he's made a judgment he taught then go back and said whoops I'm Sorry I didn't do that so it's it's not balanced and I think you need to seeing somebody and I didn't see it\nTo you both ... it was a point that was raised by the Republican senator you heard me put it to DC McAllister the whole process itself has

Hammond and today we have a special show on loneliness\nIt's something that affects all of us at some point in our lives but for some ... can become chronic and seems to be associated with poor health too\nWe wanted to know more about who feels lonely on what helps people to escape from learning is so professors from three British university has developed the b._b._c. loneliness experiment\nThey spent the past few months analyzing the data and today we have the results joining me for the whole show to discuss them as ... professor of psychology at ... university now my well I'm fifty five thousand people took part from two hundred and Seventy seven countries temperatures and islands were you surprised that this many people did it\nBecause we were surprised even because the study was quite long\nBecause we wanted to look into not just experiences of loneliness but also things that might be related to it to my drive it across different countries so we weren't surprised but also very happy with the span the variety the range and the diversity of the of the respondents\nAnd did you find differences according to age\nYes we did and they were quite different from what people generally tend to expect so we found a more reports of learning this and people aged between sixteen and twenty four years old so younger adults are than an older an older people in effect it's intended to go down with age\nAnd that will surprise a lot of people I think 'cause that was a stereotype of the older isolated looney person\nYes there is and of course we do also have long enough in older age I bought a what our data is showing is is downward trend\nAnd this is of course a self selected sample so not everybody who is in a different age groups has represented in in our sample but it's very comparable to what was recently found\nYou know a large a survey by the off the u._k. office of national statistics which is a representative sample of the u._k. population and so we we are fairly confident that this is not complete fiction it is a really what people are feeling\nAnd were you surprised that more young people told us that they felt lonely it's a time isn't it when people are having a lot of transitions they might be moving away to college all the new jobs leaving that friends\nSo the first thing to think about is that is it is there's maybe a generational issue is it maybe the younger people now of today are different from the younger people of of other views and therefore maybe those ... those younger people are by these are older and that's where the differences are coming from\nI think we can safely say that's not the case and one of the reasons why we can say that is that we also asked participants to reflect on their life\nAnd to think about what were the times in which they felt more lonely\nAnd all participants of old age tended to say that he was exactly when they are and when they were young adults so that that fits with what we actually found when people report that their own loneliness\nSo then we need to think about what is it about that age that might be associated with loneliness and indeed the things you were saying so transitions leaving home for the first time answering hired indication or answering it\nOf all of those transitions are changing your identity or sense of who you are and the way you relate to others because that is very identity base as well but also your social networks they're breaking informing breaking informing at that time it's time for live instability\nWell here's some students at Yale University and then ... and who do seem to know what it's like to feel lend me\nI was really excited to go to and investigate because it sends a lot of one issue for ages\nBut I feel like I've built up too much in my head and I sort of like\nNot quite disappointed when I got hit but like I think precious week is really oversold like see the best week your life when the oh your friends or that sort of ... I Wish I'd push yourself out and more to me I think loneliness is sort of feeling like you want to be able to talk to people more but not knowing how like\nI've looked just like sort of superficial acquaintance e friendships the I don't mind if you look at everybody talks about ...\nMore than I did for me it's about ... to no free lunch you were part of the community that you're in very limited ostracized if\nYou're on the weekends I struggle front around as much I Do like Sundays I his family as well so I definitely shovel and Sundays when or how much going on\nThat would be as well so looney but so it'd be blown out of our devices that we've heard from friends on ... food food or do you live off that people can reach ... food if I was feeding it to her\nMom went on as just a law student I mentioned that it doesn't always last long so maybe it's a very normal thing to feel at that age I'm can often be temporary\nYes so that's that's another reason that I think we are seeing such high levels of loneliness and younger people is that\nUh when when they experienced said they don't realize necessarily that this is something that can often be temporary and they also don't ... haven't rehearsed different ways of coping with it\nAnd what works and what doesn't which in itself might make it last longer so the intensity of the experiences is is higher because of course you don't know you can get out of it to or how to get out of it so yeah that's very much that's very recognizable\nIs it possible that older people might feel lonely and the same numbers but feel like ... ... I don't want to say on the study that they feel and me\nIt's very possible of course because there is indeed\nA perceived stigma associated with loneliness and by that I mean that people have the idea that if you admit to loneliness and then you will be seen as somehow we Korean adequate and we did ask about that and we did find that I was a stronger among older people so it's very possible that\nUm it's it's not entirely clear why that's not the case as much in younger people of course I'm a buck but indeed that was the case what's also interesting to think about is that we did try to to delve into that stigma and try to see well are people who admit to being alone they\nAre really negatively evaluate that are seen as we Korean adequate and we actually found no evidence for that so our participants are up to five thousand participants with generally very kind about uh other people who feel lonely and very um positive about them wanting to reach out and help\nSo it is perceived stigma but not so much stigma that actually exists and I think that's interesting to to speak about so that people realize it actually isn't as bad as they think\nAnd of course it's not a competition between the ages and if you do feel and they then of course ... ever age you are now some older people such as Ninety six year old Jack King isolated because then the longest so mobile I went to meet him in a time where he lives on the south coast of England\n[noise] really nice to meet you I was a souvenir yeah oh yeah ... as a prisoner of war\nThere is a role that my whole life for those by Boston wow\nThat's a pretty big piece of wrong because I lost like you know not a very different I'd have a lot of or ... what is needed in the last ...\nNow there's no doubt that jak if someone who's was also during history is as a prisoner of war during World War two he put in place for the other prisoners fashioning stage ... out of rice facts he'll send you have to ... elicits pie when food with gas\nBut also the ball he's busy life has been dominated by one relationship with his wife ...\nOn my ... and ... method my marriage in September a quick America for sixty five years wow she passed away I years ago the issue\nAnd was that when you started to feel lonely using huh\nOh yeah [noise] audited whereabouts afterwards because there's too little starchy I'll be everywhere we used to drive to get her she was about ... you know do the old saying about troubles shows a troubled fall happens this shit is happening is doubled\nSo true sure [noise]\nThe ... the days alone he's three sons do for a lot and someone comes in for two hours a day to help out but it's still leaves many long hours when he liked to have company so he looks for distractions like composing music on the organ painting and washing books\nSo you write poetry as well and you've written upon coal lending a plot\nTo blow the\nLotto to myself because I listen to me I took myself when I'm done so I talked to the churches and the whole ... to ... but he spoke with a tool for a look and see there is no above me\nI and also the structure and resilience of of social networks so independent cultures as social networks tend to be brought her so they they are wide are there more and more extensive\nBut they're also somewhat less dense so people don't necessarily know each other within those networks\nUm and ah they they tend to be chosen so people don't know in those networks are people you have chosen to relate to now that's great in many ways a but it also makes them somewhat vulnerable to transition say if you're moving away then you're not investing in those connections as much\nAnd they might fall off whereas in interdependent cultures those social connections tend to be denser so they are smaller a few they contain fewer people but they tend to know each other so they are dense and connected in multiple ways which makes them more resilience two times have changed our times in which he withdraw slightly for a while [noise]\nAnd that's of course the typical example with the family but not only\nSo what did you find in different regions of the world when you groups and together according to culture when it comes to letting us so first of all\nWe found a lot of similarity and that's important to acknowledge so as we spoke earlier already aged ... for example a very similar across the world um there's some nuance into the into detail of course but we also find some bigger difference says and and ... the biggest differences really that there was more reports of loneliness and more independent culture as like the pay of North America\nAt van interdependent cultures and that was especially the case among women so women and interdependence cultures as particularly privileged in terms of not feeling as as lonely and men in independent cultures were particularly vulnerable\nWell one example of a place where many people do rely on each other is actually causing a sign of college I went to meet Lydia in ... in the south of the country\nThe mind well after my husband died it really hit me I felt then Lee yes but I was very lucky to have my family around me in this difficult moment to smoke it's my father was also the father for my kids [noise] and I felt I was lucky I have my kids because\nThey helped me moving on\nAnd what about you know that your children are grown up\nI go out to have my friends to go out ways to do the passage of the week I think sometimes we do nothing and just sit around I also go to the dancing school during winter time to get me moving it but we don't go all the time once a month and we go and that's also lose\nUses these go some blue and as with relatives in the eighties sometimes\nKnee besides I don't see in the budget for them and then also bed and for me with my sister psycho and have lunch with them when they're alone\nHere in the south the usual even more during festivities that we all these people are you alone yes okay so let's meet and have lunch together food is a big funding for people\nWho was on land those you're mostly in my case I've never felt let me because I'm young I've always been surrounded by my friend's family I don't even know what it means being lonely I feel like I always lived in a very strong and you know to finally though I think the family is the price of everything\nLibya and have friend Jenny now before we go I wants to talk about what people can do about letting us we all people to tell us the solutions that it helps them cope with it\nA ... to stretch of storage sites people the I'm always opens up with them regardless of whether I'm ... I'm Sorry if I if I don't know ... or or do know you ... so you know the bus or you won't speak to my\nSouthern those really positive you know ... ...\nI definitely keep myself busy and I\nAppreciate again ... every one but that's just the way the odd things even my my friends they know that I didn't even see for not because you're you seem to be comes when you were doing stuff and that's the way I couldn't really nice and I I Love being surrounded by people and I love being off things and that's the way I keep myself busy\nEverybody can do something even if it ... they could draw or to painting watercolor\nBy then you look at it and it was it last year with it or discussed it but it's interesting that solution is just it has to do something that really distracts you like that because [noise] fifty\nFive thousand people from around the world have told us what they think about loneliness and the number one solution that people suggested was to distract cells by getting very involved in whole days old tough times all old look enough he's actually what you said yes it is the also\nSemi weather in the study jak songs of distracting yourself was the one that came out talk but what else was in the top five\nSo first of all the destruction is a is a really interesting concept because you can also think of it has some simply you know enjoying being by yourself engaging with things by yourself but of course some people will see that as a distraction if they are if they're feeling bad for example\nThe second one was about joining social groups are clubs and of course it wouldn't work for everyone I Need one work if the ... you've joined the group that is for example not accessible then you have a disability so the group itself needs to be one that is inclusive\nUm the third one was about thinking positively breaking with negative thoughts cycles which is of course a a a really a problem when you are already feeling quite lonely for quite some time so there are techniques uh um psychological techniques for this to help people get out of those cycles\nThe fourth is there's an interesting was about starting a conversation with anyone a small moments of social interaction\nCan become big moments of course and I really liked the example of that the person you spoke to who spoke about\nYou know asking people for a cup of tea that's a really nice way of preparing to have those those little moments because you do need to know what are you going to say but it's also good example of how ... how cultural this can be and how much it needs to work for you\nBecause you know it it it's funny but in in in a British culture of course people want to have tea that's a big thing and\nYet here he writes we must have been yeah by where I come from only people who are ill will have teeth opening up over say\nAnd the number five was talking to friends and family about your feeling to flee which is an interesting one because we found that the people who said that they have high levels of London is we're less likely to suggest that one suggesting it might be difficult that what what for every one\nOf course it's true and it's it's also true that to to talk about do you use the word loneliness when saying that might be the most difficult that so\nIt is also about finding ways of talking about it but not necessarily say I'm Alone they can simply be about you know I really would like to to see people more often or you know can we go for that cup of tea every Sunday instead of doing it so sporadically so it is about finding a way to do it but it is a very important wanted to do\nAnd if you want to hear more about the top solutions in debt and to try to ... which ones might what best for you to download on new ... how you can feel less lonely we put a link to it on the health ... website\nNow my mother I Know there's a lot of data still few to analyze but what is the main takeaway few that comes out of the BBC loneliness experiments I fall\nI think one of the things is that uh is is this whole divergence between\nA People's perceiving that there is a stigma and being quite ashamed about feeling lonely\nBut actually the fact that we don't find one we do not find negative views of learning as a and I think is an eye opener and it's something that we can actually stress more to to liberate people from that pressure of there being a potential stigma about it so that's something I Would want to pursue more\nWell thank you so much for joining us today man when I but I Am thankful only the ... to it but you said was pulled ...

island that was just wrong last friday by a powerful earthquake\nAnd then inundated biased you nominate there's a lot of attention on the humanitarian crisis that followed but I Want to focus on the geological setting that made the city's population three hundred and fifty thousand so vulnerable the phrase ring of fire is being thrown around but that's only half true\nSo the laziest sent back from the main ... Pacific tectonic activity but it is cool in a complex network of geological votes squeezing and bending it every which way and one of them runs right on how to\nDo with just feel comments and those are a very well I think produced a comprehensive seismic hazard map of the region only two years ago\n... is a city that sits in the sort of long gated ... valley and that is a long long a big fault called the ... fault which is the strike slip fault which\nHas considerable relative movement four to six centimeters a year of movement along it and that's\nRapid for false so it has very high potential to rupture in a large earthquake as it seems to have done\nAn strikes that means that one side to sort of moving north on one side is moving south roughly\nThat's right so the Saudis moving north and west sides moving so\nSo how much movement walls that and how much of that full broke on friday\nThat's a good question I mean it it varies of course along the fault but let's see the U.S just so we shouldn't have about six meters maxim slip but I also saw satellite analysis to suggested about five or six meters slip extended all along the fall through pollen itself\nAnd that's one of the boat and things as I understand it is that although the earthquake started some distance away it spread and Polly itself walls moved it was broken by this as quick\nThat's right that seems to be what happened the thing is the fault goes essentially right through Palo at skirts the western edge of the city but it's right there and if you were close to that it would be very violent shaking\nIn a sense I'm getting a picture of ... because of the geological history being incredibly vulnerable to all kinds of consequences of an earthquake like this\nFirst of all it was right on the fault in some it's near valley that it's right on the fault this valley is filled with very soft sediments in the sediments can amplify the seismic waves and they're also as we've seen recently subject to liquid faction and then it's right next to Holly bay in which the army's can be generated\nAnd when he talked about liquid French and that's basically when the soil tunes liquid and you know they just still holding buildings up that's exactly right once the questions I've had the non said A's how long it took full the suit on me to arrive off of the shaking in happen\nYeah no one really knows very well because until now we haven't had any data but I did just see that there was some tied gauge records from Paul who which\nSuggests a less than ten minutes of travel time if the timing has to be believed that suggests about ten minutes which is extraordinarily short travel time for this now and\nThen you can turn that into a distance because I guess you have a decent idea of how fast is you know many ways move\nYes you can it depends on the ... so you have to look at the cemetery and sort of trace the re back and I think it would have to be generated in ... bay certainly not up around them gala where the epicenter was\nAn people when they heard about the nominees recently they've been these subduction full like you have off Japan and off Sumatra when the whole see big changes it shape and that's what pushes the walls to call them and that's not the case I proceed with the strike slip this kind of sliding motion\nWell that's right so the subduction zones are what are we call thrust earthquakes for when we're the plates are being pushed together in one sort of pop up and down and that of course pushes water and that's what causes the Saddam\nWhere's this fall to the strike slip fault so it involves side by side motion and it doesn't necessarily push the water up or down you know it does a little bit but it's far less efficient\nIn generating some army than subduction zone earthquakes typically\nHowever in this case that could be two things at play here one would be submarine landslide the sides of the ... bay are relatively steep and there could have been slumping or land sliding generated underneath the water along that bay that could be one factor and during the tsunami but also there might be\nComplex fault and we've had the fault on the east side of ... bay and that seems to have switched than to the west side so there might be something happening between those two strands of default that led to uplift under the bay so it's still hard to say this point which of those calls the smell me\nBut presumably if they go out to map the seabed they can and that kind of thing out on me and it's important to do so\nWell I think it's important to do so presumably it's not as easy to sound yes you can map the sea bed and you could look for a landslide scarps\nAll the issues the after effects that you don't really know how fast the landslide was and that's a critical parameter in determining the it's an army generation but it's really fast it will be more effective in generating salami there won't be open and shut case so to speak\nThere's a lot of comments about this you know the warning system that but what strikes me is that the ten minutes if that's the right time is an incredibly short time for people to read to end up thing and in fact people have buildings collapsing around then\nOnly a few minutes before the soon Amir arrived it strikes me as a really difficult and dangerous situation for people living in that area\nThat's right that's a very very short time and as the message with a local send on like this and that are generated you know right off shore the shaking is the warning so if you feel very strong shaking and that means the kind of shaking that makes it difficult to stand in that last for\nTens of seconds you really need to head up hill as soon as you can as soon as it's safe to do so you should proceed to high ground\nBefore we finish you know this is one full which possibly has released its energy for the meantime about civil lazy itself seems to be the most appalling ... protected tectonic setting that seems to be ... with a place\nThat is true there are quite a few faults in ... either these ones are cut through the center of the public coral and associated fault but also in the north there is a very active subduction zone and they're also a couple of active crossed a fault of their so yeah there are quite a few faults and some of these faults go right near population center\nAnd along with that you also now have this volcano supports on which she's now erupting I have to us you know\nEither a consequence of what just happened or just shows us how geologically active that whole area base\nIt's really hard to say for sure when mechanic eruptions are triggered by earthquakes or vice versa those kind of events are ...\nBy the stress field in the interior yours so the earthquake will cause the ... the stress field and that might have some kind of influence on the magnetic plumbing system a volcano it's more likely to happen if the volcanoes already close to a rupture and\nThen it just took either the stress perturbation or this passage of the seismic waves to sort of push it over the edge trigger that ruptured\nThat's certainly possible but it's really hard to tell for sure\n[noise] feel come in from the Australian National University in Canberra\nSomething more uplifting let's tuned to the Japanese space agency jak says ... mission to asteroids ... early last week

how do you find the right tend to be that works and that's what the price as being awarded for this way of creating a huge array of antibodies and then fishing for the right ones that hit the target

evolution in the lab\nYes exactly so you have the target and you produce a whole library these anti parties\nAnd then some of them will buy more tightly to your target\nYou choose them and then you amplify them\nAnd then you go to the next round and choose the tighter of those\nAnd so after a few rounds you have an antibody that binds very tightly ... so it's kind of design that immediacy I wouldn't say it's designer because you didn't design anything you let the system choose and that's in fact the opposite of design you're letting evolution of selection choose what anti body to produce\nI chose was designed because the winner of the other half of the chemistry prize told this program two years ago\nThat evolution is the best designer of all time\nFrancis Arnold was on Fox and action actually twice in twenty sixteen first when she was the first woman to win the much thought millennium price for a chemistry using so called directed evolution and the second time for

make thousands versions of the protein and rapidly search through those to see which ones are better at something that we're interested in and this whole idea that evolution can be used rapidly to

I've come to find a traditional crop one might not expect to find\nIn the lush Wisconsin landscape\nYou know we grow the crop on your shade because you have to simulate the forest I'm kind of the forest canopy\nAdditional open fields shelter between the the forest but Scott to the ... to ... areas of wouldn't posts carrying matching under which grow row upon row of ginseng\nIts delicate roots whose health giving properties and much prized in Asia grows well here this ginseng said to be the finest in the world\nUnlike many in American success story behind this one likes the dreams hopes and success of warm immigrant family will see is the second generation managing director of soup ginseng\nShould this started with my father ... buying ... from local farmers and selling to friends and family members his first few pounds of ... he bought and sent home to um my grandmother his mom my dad is the\nTenth of fourteen kids my dad was born in the past ... or ... which is a small archipelago in the Taiwan Strait\nAnd he grew up very for you know my grandmother's health was very poor\nAnd so he sent her ... and my grandfather wrote a letter back saying sudden this product work send more my dad was a social worker for the state of Wisconsin when he stumbled upon jinx thing and so we just send ... home and then people offered through word of mouth that my dad abiding thing and you know ship it to you\nAnd this is not a local cottage industry sued ginseng has ... on the back of globalization\nWhat we do is we build these frying rats forging ... so it's a ten foot buying for with a metal [noise]\nBasically just put it on there and ... know yep now we drive them here frog that and the drive product over\nTo our processing facility in China and then they come back in semi finished her finished ... and then we did a finished packaging assembly here\nSome of the ... is done in Wisconsin by immigrants from last in Vietnam and also by Mexicans on temporary visas but most of the labor intensive work is done when the ginseng roots shipped out to China\n[noise]\nSo in the middle of the Wisconsin countryside orders that taken by Chinese speaking stuff Internet sales are booming and new products constantly being developed\nNew\nThis is just one of thousands of companies in the U.S with complex supply chains which have developed this trade has opened up especially with China but it has seen the harsh reality of a trade war hit home\nBecause after President Trump imposes tariffs on Chinese imports China retaliated ongoing carefully targeted tariffs was on us ginseng production will sue is now wondering whether the good times ...\nFor a product that we are importing directly into our ... office for sale into China you're basically adding Fifteen Percent on top of all the already seven point eight percent tariff that's on ... plus the V. A. T. it makes us pretty on competitive against Canadian grown and then the domestic crop\nAnd what would you say to President Trump if you had a chance about just how complicated terrorists up he watched it on feeling ... suddenly you're sending in a field in the middle of Wisconsin which in thing and it's a problem for you\nYeah you know the point that we've been trying to make with terrorists that no one wins that consumer ends up paying the price for the product I think the hard part about our industry is that we were in a free trade academy four or five years ago when this product was planted now we're in a very different regime and\nYou have very different set of rules to play by a and so you we don't have a choice really other than to pass it along to foster\nThat some system to use one of the worst consequences of a trade war President Trump could import taxes on foreign steel and aluminum entering the United states to protect those industries with other countries have retaliated because then metal producers have suffered\nThe knock on effects of just won't tariffs ripples through the economy is in companies in businesses far and wide many only just to be connected with the original target of terrorists\nKnew\n... so I'm heading south from the ginseng fields of central Wisconsin to see how the whole state is affected\nBy President Trump's apparently easy to win trade war and his wife ... economic policies along the way we'll hear about comic Wisconsin products like Harley Davidson motorcycles and visit the site of a huge new manufacturing development that the president has been\nHailing as the eighth wonder of the world but my ... is to a more mainstream Wisconsin thumb on business\nAll of you know [noise]\nBut most of them were role for where\nAll these will be back [noise]\nPick a gray runs or ... family farms a huge operation producing tons of vegetables for canning and millions of potatoes\nWhich a protest on ... the vast majority is destined for the domestic American market so you might think it would be immune to international trade disputes but that's far from being the case\nWith all the new equipment and all of a steel [noise]\nFamilies brain the product in getting it [noise]\nAnd not equipment which is used to clean and sewage tons of potatoes the day cost millions of dollars and it's produced by a number of those great global manufacturing chains and then of course he's affected by terrorists\nPutting your order great people who are retired from the oh\nWhat a surcharge or being in the same time you know I'm not sure that this was going to be back pack tape but it may work [noise]\nI think the thing people need to remember is that we're all consumers\nAnd there's no fair and I mean\nBigger conservatives in America we [noise]\nWe buy from a retailer houses up real are big houses and then we rent around\nDriving down the road Smith a number of times I think you still rejecting bingo [laughter]\nStory like [laughter] even look fellas they ... they will get and then they were renting treatment for their vote for him over and over America\nSo trade tensions means ... end up having to pay more but Monica ... to them like that be worth it to President Trump's tactics create new deals with say Mexico and Canada ... but one is still waiting to see whether those tactics work\nAllow a\nAnd it will cost people all the way it is\nWisconsin is historically a democratic state but last time it narrowly voted for Trump making the politics of business sensitive here\nMany of those voters seem to be wasting to see where all this leads Republicans anxious as mid term elections leading this November I trying to prop up the phone when folks\nWashington announced twelve billion dollars the subsidies to mitigate the effects of some terrorist especially on soybean exports but in some ways not to know comfortable move for supposedly free market Republican\nGovernment and to be some sections of the American economy have been complaining for years that the trade playing field has been inclined against them [noise]\nA very dangerous and I I think she's right about that [laughter]\nAnd you knew smoke with the wealth manager named deed or I think this was a German wealth manager who who talked about how his job allowed him to schmooze with powerful people but also in some ways discovered things about foreign countries before even the citizens of those countries would find out about this important things\nYeah he was very proud of the fact that when he was working in Africa he would have parties and the heads of state of the various countries he lived in would come to his house and get them drunk\nAnd they'd be spilling state secrets by two in the morning\nAnd then people like Katharine Graham to the lake publisher of the Washington Post would call him up\nFor advice and you know he could speak authoritative Lee about at least affairs in some African countries because he'd heard it directly from the mouth of the people who made those policies it reminds me a little bit about what we learned when the Panama Papers scandal broke I kept seeing photos or or drawings of the\nFaces of people whose names turned up in the Panama Papers and they were it was really a rogues gallery\nOf people from all walks of life as well as heads of state and corporate leaders people who you would think have nothing in common with each other but at at one level the\nFact that they are so rich gives them these very important things in common which is to say for them national boundaries and laws are all optional taxes are optional all forms of law or essentially optional at that level of wealth\n[noise] [noise]\nSo the picture you paint that for me broke up the wealth manager someone who is you know a loyal person an honest person or resourceful person trustworthy\nAnd I I fully imagined\nThat lots of wealthy people are probably very good people high minded people but I Want to talk for a moment about the professionals whose clients are very clearly you know ... how did you as a wealth manager serve the interests of someone who is\nCheating his country on taxes cheating on his wife cheating his employees\nHow do you serve appliance like that and then go home tell yourself that you are a good person and sleep well at night\nWell some of them don't and I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing a wave of leaks recently that some people are so troubled by what they're seeing that they just can't stomach it any longer and they they blow the whistle\nOften with dire personal consequences about a quarter of the people I interviewed I Would ... I Would characterize as being\nConscience stricken about the larger impacts of their work\nAnd they have a range of strategies to reconcile themselves to the implications of that for their own conscience one of the the ways that they dealt with it was to encourage their clients to donate to charity to offset the negative impact of depriving the state of revenues\nOther people I interviewed including one gentleman in Panama City said he would actually lecture his clients on the theory and practice of inequality in the world and he would point out to them that is they sat in his office in Panama City\nA couple of miles away people were living in cardboard shacks and had no access to clean drinking water and what did the client think about that\nNow that may seem mild but it's fairly risky strategy to pursue and you know frankly most wealth managers are replaceable um if you find one a little too or in your face you could always go get another one or get another one within a different company\n[noise] I think a lot of people have impressions of the lives of the very wealthy and imagine what life must be like when you're driving around in a private plane and\nWaited on by service stuff all the time and I'm Wondering in your conversations with wealth managers whether any of your own assumptions of beliefs about the connections between wealth than happiness were either confirmed challenged\nI was struck by a man I spoke to in the channel islands who talked about how suspicious wealthy people are it jibes with some things that I've seen personally and what he said was when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you\nIt's like what happens to lottery winners all sorts of so called relatives come out of the woodwork asking for loans asking for health of some sort con artist come out of the woodwork looking to get a piece of you\nBut that's what happens throughout the lifetime of wealthy people and so it breeds of kind of suspicion why do you want to be my friend why are you being nice to me or you just trying to get me give you something and you can see how that would lead ... at the extreme to a sort of Howard Hughes in retreat or isolation from people 'cause if you can't trust anyone why bother\nI mean the sad thing but you're saying is that the wealth manager might end up being perhaps among the very few people that it rich person can trust\nYeah I think that seems to be a common story it's wealthy people and their servants it almost comes to the point where you can you're wealthy person you are more trusting of the people you pay to be in your service than people you don't pay because\nWith your family you might have sort of a a King Lear problem you know which of my children actually loves me and which are out to get something from me\nBut at least ... when you are having a transactional relationship with an employee at least the boundaries there are clear you're paying them for certain services and you can assess whether they're giving you the services that the standard you require if they're not you fire them if they're doing a good job you keep them on there is a simplicity to that\nThat is not present in emotional relationships\n\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark she's the author of the book capital of Without Borders less managers and the one percent broke I Want to thank you for talking with me today thank you\n[noise]\nThis episode of hidden brain was produced by Jenny Schmidt rent acts are Rena Cohen Maggie Penman slow economy ...\nOn the show and lower court out he was edited by terrible team includes Thomas Lou uncommitted Vargas Restrepo you could find more hidden brain on Facebook\nAnd Twitter and listen for my stories on your local public radio station if you'd like to seven showed please make sure all your subscribe to our podcast at least one friend\nWho might enjoy the show I'm not going to be done to see you next week [laughter]\nSupport for hidden brain comes from the Rockefeller Foundation this is NPR\nSupport for NPR comes from ... and from universal pictures presenting their new film burst man from Damien ... director of la la land and whiplash and starring Ryan Gosling and clear for it in theaters an IMAX October twelve\nAnd from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science and the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misused and eugenics crusade premiering October sixteenth on PBS more at Sloan dot org\nYeah\nMy name is Rebecca ... and I am definitely Teach Like Georgetown I.
