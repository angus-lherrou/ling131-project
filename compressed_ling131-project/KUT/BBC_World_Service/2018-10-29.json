by president the ... that I have done and I've had enough time to prove myself so\nPeople interrupting me or judgment based on the one that I've actually put it\nCan you have a similar body of work and impressive body of work when you say directing a music video you allowed to cool the show the adults and do your thing understood\n... I think it depends on the project um it depends on who you're working with that and how collaborative the oddest wants to bake I always approach every project openly and esteem that each time it said a whole different experience because I'm always kind of different people\nThat can get very similar to see is that you've worked with a lost his email on this is my choice will by chance\nYes in some ways I have a choice in what I pitch on but there is author of the fact that you can often be actually I Would say ... cost or pigeonholed based on your previous work they're safe you out a lot of

way\nBecause I was watching your video for the Nigerian musician with kid on the song is called tease me and said to the gentleman's club you went to a gentleman\nAnd the woman dancing but I think in the hands of a different direction that video because I haven't really seen absolutely just described to us how did you handle that particular setting how did you do it\nI think that is actually the most raunchy video of ever done when he came out it was a it was a big deal because prior to that was it was kind of seemed like the Justin Bieber but just to be clean cut and that video was one of the things that broke him into that sex symbol kind of\nThinking and I know he's had a little bit nervous about it you know turning Twenty one I mean at that time but we came up with this idea where

there's\nA famous videos is out of the American sing a Katy Perry song is called our kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production zero on the video cleaned and by then we can sing or how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos and very very different I Would say that it is all for two very very different artists and inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with or not is no doubt you're putting your on Pakistan on a project and there's no way to not do that

that pass all stop or to take an artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more [laughter] thing I\nDo want to put your personal ... that that's what I've noticed that just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that is the king of the product\nAnd and and it's it's funny because that was a real fashion about five years ago all they've got to start putting names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a passionate about it's not this is an assistant for the artist if anything\nYou can get what you say that the Coleman seem it's about how women one to come across these videos about you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an artist you're thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know well so you walk\nAway and you listen to the ... see how you interpret it because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have to fall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if they have to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny isn't that just took me through how you go from page to find them put up like what are your technique\nAnd you know he seems to come down from that\nCan go who would you turn down\n[laughter] I wouldn't really necessarily say without\nListening to a chocolate without getting a brief nerd anything I I Would like to consider everything that falls in my life but having said that I'm doing commercials\nNow and I'm also a mom and I have\nA husband who's on tour and family life is a balance and I unfortunately have to say nerd and much more than say I did back in the day when they started\nThe would you say they're nice that you won't cross due to the content of it when it was in the brief when some well\nI don't know I mean let's say I mean that's all I mean to interrupt you let's say to some artists that are\nParticularly distasteful or not my cup of tea or it's\nMaybe it's just like I just find it really boring or and I'm not really inspired by it then yeah I if I'm just not feeling it basically it's enough for me to say not\nGiven what about the issue of color isn't just about prejudice or discrimination against ... people so I Would say that the enough interest and and and most African music videos is almost always light skinned do you agree with that\nI I don't watch anything [laughter] you must have seen some music that you know I Know that it's a conversation that I mean it's a nice conversation I've seen articles on his I've seen all these taking to talk for\nMaybe elevating the lighter skinned women in your videos or just using might seem limited the videos and not a whole representation of the different types of women yes I've seen that I I don't watch a lot of music videos which is really weird because I mean we live video director among other things but I don't know if it's a big deal share in Nigeria\nEasy these in Nigeria and end up getting your music videos and I think he's a huge factor she's not something that you think about it to\nLike what is your call thing we know that not just what I've never never come across an artist I said you know you get a license can personal I Know that way from\nMusic videos and ... when this huge public now with girls wanting to change the color of skin because the thing like the son of the beauties of international thing as being a light skin navy yet and I knew that that's happening a lot in the Niger in society what do you do is I've never been put in that situation ever\nAnd if somebody did said if somebody did request [laughter] I'd like to skin female lead is that something that you would ... would you have any say on that\nOh I definitely do on that because if what you're trying to portray all\nOnce you're trying to tell me is that a life that can posted in is low beautiful than the dark and just because of the cause is getting it I'm going to have a problem with that I've never been put in that position\nThen goodness then gone so it's very easy for me to sit here and be on the line and go this is what I Would do but then if someone was going to act that way I Would probably know from on the conversation I had with that person I knew that this is not the kind of us and I want to work with that never ends up being put in that position\nCan get you seeing women coming to the fore\nAbsolutely that's a lot more female directors now and that's just amazing thing when I started out I was maybe the ... director at\nWhich is a very big global company but it's definitely the only one in your ... maybe that was like one other one in the U. S. but there was really out of maybe a hundred and fifty during you know he was in Paris\nI Am now but I at the time when I first started I was based in London so yeah like I said I was one fifty directors who was female and now I'm not saying that it is twenty five twenty five\nThat's definitely a lot more room for improvement but luckily women I now I think there's no reason why women shouldn't be directors and there's a lot of young girls puffing up\nShe thinks changed ... what is it allows for them to come out now\nHow to be specific to know exactly but I Would say technology you know the fact that feels much less daunting to pick up a camera now and to access editing and and also I think maybe a relatively new thing as of the last two years it's been a negative started\nBy a female she quit her I'll quote free the ... which is really wonderful because it really encourages females in our industry whether it's in commercials or music videos it's a database that exist on line basically just needs to be female to be a part of it\nSo in case somebody looking for a female director they can just sort of go on the website and have a look and see who's out there that basically that the whole point of it was to encourage\nAdvertising agencies to actually pledge to have females in every single pitching process of a commercial this health again doing\nBusiness know Kenny how who feel oh you that soon you won't have this dubious on now being described as the only female Nigerian music videos director\nIt's already happening when I first came into the industry I mean you had fuel directed by the window music videos if you think it's a problem globally even was\nIn Africa and especially in Nigeria picking up or something can I said earlier on when she goes as a trend of putting the name on the the music videos actually do that I'm One of the reasons I Do that is\nBecause it's imperative for me at the little gold watching the television to see that in the U.S looks like a female name that's the goal that did that video how things have changed is\nBy these young girls who people like king of seeing people like me\nBut I'm not just in the industry but we are actually competing in the industry\nNot just in the ring of women but also in the ring of men when I have interviews I very very conscious of the was that I use a lot of times when you when we do have enemies in my gym at what they tend to say is oh what does it feel like being in in ... industry plus correction is it's not a real industry the male dominated industry they're trying to change that\nI wrote that tell you how I had been able to come into the industry thing about how to drugs remain\nI Need to use pungent was if I go oh was me it's so hot da da da da da\nAnd then you might get into the hands of the little girl watches you going to go it's too difficult you know I'm just going to\nStep up and not get involved that's not what I Want I Want them to be able to see me and see that I Am actually competing in this industry that number one\nMentorship something that big for me is every once in a while and then she will go on Instagram go anyway just\nPull out women uncle come over here you can be on this project and then you're being around understanding that he can be done senior woman in the position of power and building them as well and so many of them have gone on to be their own directed doing their own little project\nI can send us that she is your dream artists which is what you'd like to work with\nKenny I Would say beyond me 'cause she will challenge\n[laughter] I get I mean if we can\nActually get to try that for that one [laughter]\nAnd you had any other time you'll pay [laughter]\nBeyond said as then thank you so Kenny and ... and it's been a patient speaking to you in the conversation today thank you thank you I've been talking to the wood winning music direct his ... from Nigeria and ... thinks listening I'm can check with back again next week [noise]\nThis is community supported public radio K.

she doing Thirty years she wasn't within the elite of the president parliament he was someone they always held\nStrong view sometimes controversial fuels and he had his a group of loyal voters that or only enough to elect him congressman\nAnd doing Thirty years he remained like this\nTo the point that when we had\nThese car washer ... basically ... to wait ... great parts of the political establishment she was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party\nThat was touched by corruption giving him an edge and this all wrote off someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually voted for Mr both ... was the vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and she was the candidate that can ... the most and in the most efficient manner these rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the ... que community and he made racist comments about slave descendants of his presidency going to mean with all of these common some concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were polling remarks probably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where I Believe that the president institutions Cindy president political environment is strong enough\nTo avoid and to prevent that ideas like this are transformed into public policy and how do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that's hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strength of their president legislative and judiciary system\n[noise] now those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single the we want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nShe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose ... to be his ministry of finance oh look at it as is an economist that is very respected in Brazil and someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring these trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a

and welcome to news they China and James with you this morning\nGet a few minutes we'll speak so twenty seven year old British ledger in business but just landed the Daily Beast dreams without [noise]\nStart in Indonesia and not crash over the line at a line airplane carrying more than a hundred and eighty people the plane disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off\nFrom the Indonesian capital Jakarta an a search and rescue effort is under way let's seek to our correspondent in Jakarta ... tourists met tell us what more do we know that about the crash well what officials have\nBeen able to tell U.S China and the last hour and a half or so vessels are that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out one\nUh which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nNow what to be such an rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations when these kinds of tragedies in disasters strike\nIn Indonesia what they've been able to say it's currently they believe they found a debris from the aircraft as well as things that they at possessions that they believe belonged to those on board uh they've described things like ... safety jackets um other sorts of possessions but at this point\nThey still haven't found any survivors and obviously the focus is very much I'm trying to find anybody who may have survived the plane crashed they've also sent helicopters to scour the seas\nAre in the nearby areas to look for any people uh but at this point all that they can tell us is that the such and rescue operation is continuing and they're sending more vessels and helicopters to the area\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to uh to return to base shortly before the crash or the rescue officials or any fills in Indonesia reading any ... anything into this as a as to the cause of the crash\nWell it's kind of what they do say that they can confound the cause of the ... crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they\nAre looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some ... to forty meat is into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed at so no official confirmation of this analysis I I\nTo add but what he's been able to analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer out it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plain look like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance ah India from from the point that it took off now\nAt those reports that you were talking about the fact that the ah air craft at the pilot and I should say at had\nAsked to turn around soon enough to take off that's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will ... really reveal more information about why this happened\nAnd encouragement give us an idea when do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take a shining to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia\nA few years ago covering the crash of ally in air flight a which landed which crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact as the there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nAh the safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty uh to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that line has taken safety most serious the over the last few years and has invested\nIn safety procedures and that's been a statement that's come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any further survivors any survivors rather and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nCourage mountain many thanks to our correspondent in Jakarta encouragement but funny there with the latest on that crash of the line at line air airplane\nAnd just over a week American will go to the polls in a bitterly contested election that will decide who controls Congress but there's a political campaign English continued to spot the shootings in Pittsburgh a pipe bomb sent to many leading Democrats\nHowever the events of

corruption in ground\nBut it also is probably my ... a ... mile individually didn't systems so if you couldn't have an anti policy sentiment was inevitably an anti pee pee sentiment and there are many other things in the mix there's also the strong support of the Pentecostal churches\nAnd it's very strong kind of moral discourse about contamination the idea that Brazilian society is being contaminated\nAnd the resurrection of the spectrum communism is quite extraordinary because I mean the PTA fruits focus is more or less of European style section democratic coffee but Venezuela or on the border of um Brazil has fad sharing scientific and the said element\nIs of course the massive use of social majoring fake news and as we now know that millions reporting to the state needs

continuously attack as a very conservative organization sold makes some sense or even a right wing organizations but to be accused of being a communist organization\nIt's actually laughable but it worked why why do people that's part of the overall like like a duck to call it mentioned uh this overall trend in fake news or the use of the of the social networks brings all kinds of scare tactics

who takes over how does the protests begin\n[noise] well I think what you mentioned just before that I could imagine probably will not be prepared\nTo to to to candidates again\nFor for the position of power the leader that there will be several options we were talking about on the ground or come carbon power was secretary general of the city will and we were talking about in Bonn minister of health\nAnd I got an American cabinet but I think that might also be purses which we are not looking at for the moment being maybe even from outside of the parties that punishment such as they come out for um a faction leader of the CDC is who\nWho then went out of politics and this working and the economy and in banking for the moment being but who could probably return\nAnd the way the ... the CDC has lost power ongoing American lives lost support is that in your view connected almost directly with a decision in twenty Fifteen to persuade the power to persuade the country to welcome a million refugees\nWas she didn't welcome a million refugees but she saw in that time\nThat there was a humanitarian crisis from Austria Hungary along to conclude that Germany at the duty to help those people to avoid it very difficult situation or along the route but nevertheless you're right the problem\nWe were the problems we're facing or so in this very moment with is hundreds of thousands of

the issue the game when Nineteen Seventy one one of the world series for the Pittsburgh Pirates [noise] was a a huge component of that when\nAnd made it a point to actually speaking Spanish shouldn't have mentioned uh the island of what the legal so I think someone like him really has a set of baseball stored memory of this is my opportunity on a national stage\nTo mention the island particularly the context of post Cherokee muddy and so there's a lot of thinking man you know we don't have a lot of bright spots are particularly in\nA maybe local or national media contacts so someone like Alex who did an extraordinary job and led a team that performed historically well I'm a means something you know even on a small level\nDo you think the disaster a Hurricane Maria did something to chorus psyche and uh how did that motivate him\nSomeone like Alex who has tried to been knocking on the door for a big it will be coaching or for an office related role I think that was a motivation enough you really had every element of experience that you would possibly to get to get a job like that\nA general manager winter ball well Baseball Classic I played the big leagues that play college ball I I was a bench coach in Houston with our analytics driven organization you did everything he possibly could uh but there's no question just I Would think from a a an emotional family standpoint and the fact that\nYou really grew up in a God Bless her our winter ball um and just probably has that emotional drive you know the the the sort of post ... let's let me be shining lights or a component to to drive there\nYou know we tend to think of Red Sox nation as being in Boston and then once you get outside of a one twenty eight Ninety five it starts to get more diffused should reconsider Puerto Rico a key part of Red Sox nation\nFrom my humble experience or you know family being huge baseball fans over the generations\nIt usually came down to a player someone really loved that tend to be from the island ... you might need Puerto Ricans that were historically pirates fans can Clemente\nUp but the other component would be I Would argue people that have family or grew up just loving it seems ... so the fact that Alex core is a manager of one of the historically a successful franchises in the league and had an historically successful season is first time around\nYou know maybe you do get a few more Bo Sox fans who didn't of course grow up rocks barrier didn't grow up in Lawrence or somewhere like that\nBut maybe you get a few more that embrace a Red Sox nation because of the success\n[noise] it it feels so significant uh this championship for Cora ... and and so many ways um you mentioned how he's a role model just as a Puerto Rican Puerto Ricans but how do you see his career influencing the game for other Latino players are potential managers\nYeah I think ... I think what jumped out to me was uh the fact that again he worked so hard to get every point in his resume or to line up for a role like this so his stint ESPN um he was a bench coach for the Houston Astros\nA folks you know baseball Jack Lew now to a gym there uh came from corporate America very analytics driven not from a traditional you know I coached the miners are played pro ball sort of track\nWe had the traditional attract but really worked on getting\nThe the the media experience track the analytic ... and I think those elements together allergies can be a tremendous role models for Latinos from all different sort of ethnic economic backgrounds in in in their introduction to the the pro game on what\nAll components you could put together to put yourself in a position to get a job like that\nMichael ... veterans sports writer he's also president of the ticket brokerage firm that data thanks very much for being here Michael\nNo pleasure thank you sir\nHey America we're doing our best not to go today up here in Boston but some celebrate tore music is in order\nJust as one of your mood music ...\nWorld music it comes to us from Nikolai veto catches the world like kick you weedy in San Francisco [noise] this is a tune called didn't send Denny I'm South African ...
