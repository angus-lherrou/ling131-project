quintessential onto sub Bush was candidate of course because first target is to be cheap but his main target is the political system as we knew it so the priest each of the political system all parties included\nAre so low in the historical low point in Brazil\nThat someone that appeals to this ... sentiment in the Brazilian society with a credible credentials because although he has been in politics for a long time for Thirty years\nHe's has always been an outsider never in the mainstream and what was a witness in the past has become clearly is Trent\nLott adult said what would you see is is he being he's appeal\nI think he had his timing has been excellent he was quietly in Congress for twenty eight years and now he has made this move he tapped into the disc content the frustration of voters\nThe corruption the poor state services the economic recession the job losses\nHe manages to present this blend of social conservatism but also mixes with their economic liberal listen in his particular vague proposals so he presents these proposals that perhaps I'll back to reassure investors\nCapital markets both international and domestic have been very tranquil listening to what type of he said and what has been going on the simplistic solutions sometimes present it\nMay be exactly what people feel is will the wouldn't like to hear at this moment\nAnd he is very good at talking he doesn't say much why he talks but that's the point sometimes and I think that is really life at the heart of his success typing into the mood\nSo let's think about the background to all of this you mentioned the timing mother talks to just give us a sense of the state of Brazil's economy\nTo the state of the economy is just gradually imaging out to a recession unprecedented two year recession alongside this recession job unemployment has\nReally rocketed up from about six percent before the recession started in twenty uh fourteen uh all the way up to about twelve Thirteen percent\nIn recent years alongside the recession the fiscal management the poor fiscal management of the previous government to be the governments have been exposed Brazil's public debt is Seventy seven percent of GDP some six point two percent of back and goes just to interest payments\nThe budget is is in a situation where\nPrimaries surpluses of the ... the boom years if you like or under President Lula have absolutely disappeared so they've got enough and living beyond its means really well beyond its means and with ... ... to meet to well I should say the current government has made ... efforts to reform\nBut it is a very fruit a weakened government I'd of very divided Congress such if I'm that you'll you'll agree\nI think in the background I entirely and just like to it's a two or three comments one is that it's been the longest recession ever registered in Brazil in history and the recovery is the slowest ever registered in the Brazilian history\nSo it's hard to imagine from outside the levels social frustration and Brazil especially when you consider that prior to that\nThere has been a lot of upward social ability and Brazil from two thousand and three until two thousand and ten so that the emergence of new so called new middle class in this so called middle class has been severely hit by the recession\nNo wonder that this bogus residents decide who who had voted for the tea in the past is now voting massively for ...\nDays the need to be a victim that second sense of a change in global economics China perhaps demanding the the commodities and so on rather than just of economic mismanagement\nHad they we are witnessing in Brazil it's a combination of factors we have witnessed a growth and law inclined mentioned Brazil between two thousand and three eyes to Charleston and fourteen or from them and for all the words of the criticisms off do my economic policy that even people\nInside the degree that they are there are two measures that she lied during her second third or wrong but beyond that we had a ... year political instability and Brazil has had a direct aim by in our economy\nAnd not have been a tea though comes out of the corruption scandals and ... that has flooded from them or doesn't ... he has to take responsibility for that and actually look to that but the ... the the fact that is struggling to win votes and it's an action you know that many I guess ...\n... with regards to the first grade citizens against uh the austerity measures we agree that that they were wrong but in addition to that we have to remember the right\nAt the beginning of this second term off do must governments call grass has approved what we call about a bomb bus which our budget deals that ... negatively and the Brazilian budgets and\nThese wasn't like by the president of the lower house queen raising jail right now and also true my support from Brazil and opposition it's all politics as worse it is better for us because we can't change the game and that has being done much for the present anymore I'm\nOn a ... that's the problem you see right there they never recognize any mistake that they have done for all those years you know it was very easy\nRound has a lot of great it was why Mary\nEasy to have a budget surplus when commodity boom and the first term of a Lula was really I I was very happy with his performance I

I\nDon't know is that is that usual to have the ... would it be welcome do you think in any country to have to admit it tri ... involved in in in the interior\nWhen in Brazil I think there is a huge sensitivity about the Amazon I'm having a foreign presence in the Amazon and such adopt extend the sort of nationalist\nView of Brazil security which is of course the typical view many countries will have but in this particular circumstance does imply in some way that they will be a military presence along the border and given the scale of organized crime happening on the border\nVery often that seems to be broadly acceptable in Brazilian society\nI think the more important distinction however about the role of the military is on the issue of its attitude it's very nationalist and interventionist aptitude to wear a growth and development the Brazilian ministry has a very strong traditionally has always had a very strong\nVocational most to boost Brazil's development\nAnd I think Shia international markets have got to slightly I think or do they think that both tomorrow will be very economically liberal but if he has a lot of military presence in his future cabinet\nUh then I don't see how they can expect to realize the sort of economic liberal version but his economic advisor ... talks about\nA ... there I mean I understand your concern but I think they have um\nBeen very clear about is if you read their program for a governor that the one number one thing that they keep heating on is just the need to reduce the size of the state\nMost of them are in many in many reviews acknowledged that there was a role for state involvement in the economy especially in the beginning of undecided vision of the country in the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties but nowadays a large state disassociated with corruption ... associated corruption and there are a lot of studies that support that\nHe's government is clearly one that the fans the reduction of the size of the state the reduction of spending\nHe's already has a plan to reduce the number of ministries and the people who are a leading his economic team they have a very clear record of being very pro

coalition has been put together have sleep\nRight and you have different groups that do not necessarily see eye to eye in various issues\nAnd I think a doctor mark group is absolutely correct in pointing out that there is a lead to conflict between the nationalistic mind side\nOf the military and the liberal team which has been gathering around the economist in a previously announced finance minister follow get let's see how this play out the ... an old programs for the liberty to leave vague\nFor us I mean I Know people who are working closing the so called headquarters of his campaign what may have to judge is like if you read the two programs right and I think there is a stark contrast between this program ... of the comic projects [noise]\nThat's what we go for the one hand I understand what you're saying that the ... wants to bring power that is really that you put them to the past whether they're going to be faithful I understand that but clearly that's how\nThe business

seen markets are my offered by nature\nYou know but it's a it's a it's a signal that they're giving\nOut again today if I can bring you know there is there is that renewed\nAbout which makes it difficult for the PC well actually there was an anti globalization mood not just in Brazil the old days of the wild and one which in which some many people are choosing perhaps to have a different view of the role of the state in the lives\nWe have two different very different projects with these two very different approach in one side we have a feel of a sudden arrow himself as a liberal surrounded by mid century or\nIs on the other side it has a dodge who has a guide a developmental is approach to the economy where this stage ought to have\nA friend [noise] so what we have every zoo is lawless state versus I stayed that we're intervening economy to create jobs and to fall and the economy more people have in jobs more people would spend money and ... that there is in an economy\nProblem is that they don't ... they don't know when to stop intervening right you have a development bank the largest development that has more credit than than the world bank and they compete with the banking system rotting front that that's why you have\nBecause the things that both so NATO is saying there's already has any need eight said a reflection on the ground\nThis weekend for example we had a bummer ages being tried ten and also their cars being put on fire so de escalation of violence in the sea you'd had already gotten\nThat set ... me from Greenpeace how would you describe the future of the environment or in Brazil if ... comes to pie dig a\nWell I think I think she summarized quite a lot of uh our our Sharon's in Brazil with regards to above average regards to ... basically defends his father is to manage\nThe ministry a a record shirt with the ministry environments uh it's it's a clear perception that a recall trade it's Long Beach or were you ah calling us the Puerto environments uh in Brasilia\n... states that do you think\n[noise] no I'm really had me put it that way I'm really concerned because I think the Bush or NATO has bad instincts as regards to the environment\nHe has a very primitive and regret Seville in that respect but I don't share to sort of kept the blues make feel because I think there are a countervailing forces and residents aside even in the corporate sector even\nMultinationals who are in Brazil operating in agribusiness sector\nThey know died of a hat on attack on the environment would generate closure of external markets to them so I'm a it's let's see how this play out I'm concerned\nI'm somewhat alarmed but clearly I don't share those catastrophic used that word express it before\nMe Monica who does the Brazilians the jobs the economy needs to grow bus on the global stage many people who want to see Brazil taking a lead in protecting the environment could Brazil as a ... threatened in the past ... for instance from the Paris climate change agreement\nHe might be you know and that would be a very very unfortunate thing to happen\nYou know one one a light into a ...\nAt the end of the tone of that I just saw today that they he's going to see requested during a he's this huge home to a with together the debit culture minister into\nAnd the firemen ministry which um from what I Know it doesn't work and anywhere any part of the world so um there are a lot of moderate people working for ... campaign there quietly working for him\nOr they're not debating they're not into social media um but they are working for him and my hope is that\nIf he's really I'm committed to creating jobs over the future to foster a tourism in in in Brazil especially ... tourism that he he there will be an economic incentive\nTo protect 'em a man in Brazil and um and and I I Do hope that that happened\nWhen they went out on top of the time I'm going to move on if\nIf Brazil chooses shy of ... easy is embracing some kind of strong men rule it at face it has become popular in many parts of the wild or is this a more profound change that will change the nature of Brazilian democracy a moderate talks to\nI think Brazil as the recession or the corruption investigations have really better institutions and for years for decades Brazil\nPoliticians have been modeling alone muddling through each crisis each scandal and now I think finally if somebody steps forward and dust is in\nA way that respects the rule of law and shakes up in a way the system yes we could see something like back however\nI really have no ... cautions lots of concerns about it\nThe situation and the most important let's say sign for us to look for is how do the people accept it\nAll things going to be calm when he takes office in early January who are we going to have riots is escalating the violence that moved temp came to bring them in a tree onto the streets I think that's where we will see if we're going to go faster or slower or just actually have a chance for reform he\nGot in a given everything that Brazil's going through is the new or if the strong man simply too powerful the old policy to succeed\nNo actually the opinion polls have shown that this has changed over the last week between October ... start or this week a bull center has lost or at a two percent of the voters she's rejection increase by five percent\nAre going from ... to ... percent with similar to dodge if that trend keeps going on Sunday we could see a river similar to what happened in the last election\nWhen Dilma Rousseff was spreading against ...\nMonica who is not lost ...\nYeah I Know I I I we elect to them and ah we ah\nWe don't know who's gonna win elections there is a ... view of NATO but we just you know we can't uh nobody can celebrate in the elections are have a car\nI'm I'm I'm if people are concerned I think there is a lot of reason to be concerned about a book on our own government and in fact democracy but I'm equally concerned if not more we don't we in from the uh died um\nAnd they are the ones in their own program who say about changing the uh the makeup of the uh superior uh um the courts and and the changing\nThe constitution pardon shit that's not true that is not even if they are on edge they change according to the wider okay are you worried about their parents so that probably ... watch and they weren't clear interests parents are words that okay I\nJust read it says you have also led to UC Brazil's the chat embracing a strongman or if it's just as a temporary change the now is there more profound change at at ... ... well\nThat remains to be seen my take is that in a in a symbolic way Brazil is shorter back in the strong man route but in real life uh to run the country is not a one man show Brazil is the federal system\nHas a motive barter system has Congress with a veto powers has a strong judicial power so if ... tries to test the waters and that's what it that way\nI think she want go very far\nTo think about that ... food too I think it says you fast a\nGot donate Monica who dominated the America don't said thank you all very much if you'd like to listen to the

you pay so much good food [laughter] was thing is probably lower was she ...\nShe'll we find out what he thinks everyone [laughter] way off to send us a voice about that idea\nThat law thing of me being a chef\nYou know me say much of my daughters\nThing they do in school or in their pay something you know they become really close to that God and that kind of makes me such a jealous but at the

she does Mr ... that's the biggest surprise for her and ...\nAnd Sam in a nutshell get bashed in West thing about being with a chef\nBest thing having good food and having fun I just find out all shops are really really fun [laughter] and actually I see different cultures through food because I follow may to a lot of different places so I see definitely\nDifferent cultures that I've never like really experience\nWorst part long hours and ... you have to accept that the part already it's always the restaurant first\nShould we have what may thanks yeah I\nThink as a chef and because I Love making people happy I think I'm Alone than some also quiet romantic all day to day basis and quite busy so I Love planning her birthday special dinners and holidays\nSalas surprising her with ... kind of original ideas and they think that gives me brownie points for the rest of the year and\nThe west thing as own out a lot or daydream when I'm stressed out about where I think one time she saw me fake smile while she was telling a story in the middle and she's like or even less dangle while you fake smiling and I just laughed because she knew I didn't hear a thing\nSam what do you think about that\nShe always organized the best party for me but the the bad thing like the worst case is that's only happened like every two years because her focus is that the restaurant\nThat will serve out the best and west things about being married to a chef and do you think can tell them will agree\nWith very very tight\nAnd we it was a relief for me to be with somebody who was as focused on that would cause me\nIncredible lifestyle now having done a lot of hard work we do meet some incredible people and the one thing is possibly seeing him not have enough\nTime where they feel though I was really really really really hard to make sure that he has so much time with him\nTaken him to the restaurants and eking out on a day's time not so he can spend time with ... on the ... so some things you know I don't know what to tell them have to say\nNow I think the best thing about being married to a chef best will say will be ... Sunday lunch and a mean only\nBut the worst thing beer by by being married to a chef is probably never quite know when I'm going to be there to do it\n[laughter] so direct there's no there's no I Know I I don't know why that is really funny is there's no underlying things have told me that that's what it is a lover that's talking\nAbout the incredible lifestyle you have now but it hasn't always\nBeen that easy we took to last about the stress of the law allow is and how it affects you will but financially running restaurants is going to be a risky business and just because the restaurant has ... even doesn't mean it's going to be easy to make ends meet to sit\nAnd cry key\nIs tough but that is still my job I I called sleep without having seen the bank accounts and made sure that\nThe guy got paid and the stuff get paid which is that she would have to do and I get home [noise] it is tough on the margins are really really really tight it's tough I don't really know how to tell you how tough but there are a lot of sleepless nights\nMost about the more rock and roll side of all this because chefs and nine to ... team ready hard is that somebody just thing it's really good fun Sam\nShe party really really hard like a one time we were at all and therefore festival in Paris all the chefs came out and then they party until four AM and she lost everything like phone wallet and that's how they party I think they're the most fun people that I've ever met\nBeth does the partying ever get too much I read that you might she stopped drinking even tell them because of the intense snake ... the ...\nVery very bright make good on it or yeah\nUm we used to meet up after he finished Sheila and we'd be out and so how we'd have breakfast at six AM and go back to him to bed about nine in the\nMorning that was a social life early days it's hard cool and he's given samples that added up\nThe minute we\nHave the two stars and book rising making TV shows\nCome would not be able to do all of that and I probably wouldn't have a nice see if I did only because we really really did too much of it\nAnd ... has owning a restaurant bought any rock and roll into your life oh not me [laughter] I don't mind going to the ...\nI don't think she can bring more she voted for an awful for a couple of levels of wine\nIf anyone's listening to this and they've got that ... they think he or she looks rather nice and thinking about making the fast Mays\nBest would you have any advice for them would you say don't do that\nI was I think very Cassidy it's definitely a different\nLifestyle I Try really hard to support the girls that the restaurant who see the chefs whose Haji you can feel quite alienated at times even though nothing's happened that spot is just purely business in time\nUm but it can be incredibly passionate and focused about life and and love and all of that but just definitely think\nPer pad to risk it let us know what's he saying can find us on social media\nUsing the hash tag BBC the chain or a month with that at any Thomas BBC for me and the rest of the team shovel and I called them and Sarasota thanks for listening and joined us again for the food chain next week [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is community supported public radio G.

Afghans\nWill have to wait until next month to get the results of last Sunday's parliamentary election but in one sense the verdict is already in the ballot again exposed widespread insecurity and the actions of government control\nIn many parts of the country my guest today is president Ashraf Ghani has recently appointed and strikingly young national security advisor how below ...\nThis is our country if it does not winnable\nWe have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion what I\nCan say to you or is this is that changed country as a result of your investment\nThat's how we do a lot more ... on Hong talk after the news\nWe had some technical insurance on day one um but it was repeated an unfortunate too was provided arms station and we had modeled actions on the second day\nYou're you're giving me a ton of of detail but I feel you're not addressing my main point my main point really is a very simple one how come Seventeen years off to the Taliban government was toppled how come that Afghanistan has never been seen as secure in those Seventeen years as it is today\nWell that's the perception is sure that's what you think ... what makes\nNo no no no respect has on why laying on I was a whole host of independent analysis including from the U.S government as well they all think and it's backed by figures figures on the amount of territory that is now controls all operated in with impunity by the Taliban\nIt when when we talk of control we have to have a definition of what that means if control mean providing governance and services to the people\nThen I don't think that's what the Taliban provide if it's fear yes that exists and we are at war Steven we were not denying that we're at war in a ... with the thought about in the twenty of so terrorist groups that operate\nA because of the instability that the Taliban provide a ... I asked for calling a ... and and making it sound like it is all falling apart I think we're not looking at the detail in this matter one has to look a lot closer\nThan just the mere headline I Do not really what the situation in that transformed country I Am\nPainfully aware that it's very it's easy for me I Would ... I missed my ground you're easy for me to sit in London and tell you\nAbout the situation in your country and sound as though I'm being extraordinarily arrogant I Do not mean to do that but I Do wish to ask you a very direct question you're all the government's national security advisor\nThey are all experts on the security in Afghanistan who say that if you drive an\nAlly in any direction from the capital Kabul it will in effect put\nYou in Taliban territory to quote one acts but actually Jackson and foreign policy magazine he says they may not be a Taliban flag flying but everyone will know who is in charge the Taliban may can enforce the rules they collect taxes they decide how much of a president's the state\nGovernment can retain is that true or not it's\nNot ... there are areas there are districts where there are a ... where Taliban are collecting taxes and they are\nAre benefiting from illegal minds and they are a ... exploiting a in a in the businesses in the areas are from the jungles illegal logging in the likes of criminal activities that they are engaged in\nA but to say that they control those areas is I think a a very big exaggeration yes they can drive fear into people in those areas they can they can get ... they they will be able to kidnap and there'll be able to attack people but\nDo they govern those areas I think that there is has to be a distinction between does well forgotten it if you always telling me is it wants to every inch of the country yes yeah is it possible\nTo man every inch of the country no do you know but no country does that but to be able to bring the ah the population centers the Afghan population central under control and provide them with security is an effort that we are uh uh that we have that we've been working on and are not working well Lance\nOr even for the areas where there is a there is in security so that I have the support of the people and new solutions to uh to bring stability to those areas and security for the people I I understand you know you understand\nYou're working on the challenges and the challenges are real just explained to me if you can because you all the president's national security advisor as over the last few months\nExplained to me why according to the Pentagon inspector general the civilian death\nToll in Afghanistan has reached a new record high in recent months the last year\nWhy is it that the trajectory is it in the wrong direction and the the most important function of any government that is protecting civilians your government cannot achieve\n... where we are under attack as the space for the insurgents grew smaller and they're not able to launch the kind of attacks they wanted to to take territory in two thousand fourteen after the international security forces the majority of the national security forces left\nA they tried to take territory and that has been there a strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics which two attacks in cities and populated areas\nTo bring international pressure and of course pressure on the Afghan government\nUm that said we have been working at protecting call it a a a population centers um you hear of the news of the extraordinary of attacks that happen but you don't hear of all the attacks that have been preventing that we have been preventing our security institutions have been\nA improving their ... their service system to prevent them and prepare themselves for the changing tactics\nThat he had about how do you tell the guy who played by that I I'm\nSo sorry to interrupt ms ... it it is difficult but this delay on the line with them or you tell me about the scale of the Taliban threat the more I get completely confused about what your own government isn't doing in response for example why is it\nThat you are failing to keep up the force levels that you promised\nTo actually deliver security to the Afghan people\nAs I understand that you'll according to the Pentagon your force numbers both in the police and the armed forces on now at least ten percent below that expected string of numbers appear to be dwindling
