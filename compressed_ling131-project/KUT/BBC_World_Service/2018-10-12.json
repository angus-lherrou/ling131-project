U. T. Saturday morning at\nNine AM and it's a one hour roundtable discussion that presented a deep dive on the major races themes and issues defining these twenty Eighteen elections the politic show from NPR's Saturday morning at nine AM to Eugene Ninety five [noise]\n\n[noise] maybe see well ... ... with the real story one topic one hour every week\nAnd this week we knew this climate change but what about the political changes that are needed to tackle rising temperatures according to the un report heat waves droughts and floods could be the future is a much of the world if we can't keep the temperature rise to one point five degrees Celsius\nBut we for pet to make dramatic changes to the way we live for the sake of the time it will in the public agreed to pay for the switch from producing fossil fuels to clean renewables\nSauces that it used to a ... of growth and prosperity they're willing to give up causing me to the good of the F\nWill rapidly growing economies except to break on rising living standards to tackle climate change until the Democratic politicians have the will and the incentive to jump in such a tough policy agenda that's the real story from the BBC coming up off to the news\n\nShould be going about these reports clearly spelled out to different choices in the strategies that we want to pursue to to achieve net zero global emissions and these strategies are important because depending on which strategy reform all\nThey can be positive or negative consequences for all their suicide two goals that risk that we set ourselves rethink here about\nA eradication of poverty food security biodiversity and so on so it is really important that while keeping in mind that are about keeping in mind the end goal of reaching net zero emissions by ... century\nWon't really approached this from a from a smart and an integrated way\nOne last thought Ben big things to think about but what about the cost ... the ... estimated in order to achieve that\nThe cost of this of achieving babies are actually relatively small if you look at the overall picture\nMuch of it are investments and investments in the economy to provide jobs they also provide many older coup benefits they provide clean air clean water biodiversity and so on so we just\nReally hard and and the report does not provide a comprehensive cost estimate of this so it does it really hard to give it a one fix number it is however clear that it can be done without jeopardizing economic growth or bell fair or sustainable development and I think that is really clear if a message that comes out of the report\nThat just finally we are talking about trillions of dollars governments over the next\nAn until twenty fifty investments if you want to call it that of trillions of dollars absolutely ... thank you very much so now there is plenty to think about that some tough choices ahead\nAnd the question to many people may now be ... what does it mean for us standards of living in the developed world is the inevitable that will have to take a drop in living standards the way we live how we live\nUh in order to achieve some of these targets and in countries that are growing rapidly would these changes that development at risk ... that you are an ecological economist to the songs that like to you\nSo from my perspective just to add a bit to add to your previous discussion with theory I think the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of action on climate change\nAnd climate breakdown really because we're talking about as we're talking about over eating a terrible catastrophe is I think an investment is exactly the way to think about it\nAnd I think we also have to be very realistic about the kinds of things we're trying to preserve we're trying to preserve have human existence on the planet we're trying to preserve the lives in chances of among the most vulnerable people as well because the most vulnerable populations there's already poor\nOr or elderly or have more difficult circumstances will be the most affected the first affected so I think that that has to be your absolute priority and from that perspective economic cost is necessary it's not that it it's just an absolutely necessary investment\nNow of course they're all going to have to be very very big changes and we're hopefully going to talk about this quite a bit um including the fact that we're talking about energy rejections so not just energy efficiency that reductions in total levels of energy demand especially in the ... because we've really left his problem too too late we've really been delayed\nBy all kinds of problems um such as a climate denial us and influences a big fuss lobbies so but we usually have reduction\nOf ... of of energy use you're talking about people getting out that cause and walking on cycling or using public ... for an\nAbsolutely absolutely and so especially in the industry and we are talking about reducing our energy is considerably um however uh the research shows in my research and particularly I'm as well as others that energy consumption does not necessarily mean living standards so it is possible to have a perfectly good quality of life\nAnd have lower energy use but the infrastructure has to be there the infrastructure has to be in place such as public transit ...\nIt's safe to cycle and walk in the hat or a\nLower ideas on its own do you think that people living in cities as they do now especially in the developed world are going to see it quite as positive is that\nWell in fact what we know I said people in cities have generally lower carbon footprints\nWhen compared to people who don't even see the if I think just in my experience coming from Cambridge this morning I was biking behind a bus and there was black\nSmoke coming out of the bus I think that in you know it's easy to see particularly on these area of benefits from changing most have transportation what some of the state today benefits are from reducing things like oil consumption\nBut in terms of the ordinary people and you if you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that call and trying to use public transport it's a tough off\nCertainly I think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of top down leadership in terms of what neither side they see the level at the regional level and at the national level do and we also need lots of my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these cold benefits of\nChanging the way in which we work but I think that you're right that the notion that from one day to the other we're going to get people in London to completely change the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because actually they release in ... the public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as Yuri and ah and Julia mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that this is hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with these both top down and bought them up\n... says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to the Christmas\nActually didn't agree I mean I think of getting people to get a cone still sitting in a traffic jam is that she couldn't appealing a ... lot so people go to the cause and we're on the bus it wouldn't be the traffic down so everybody get to it for the food you know the private code is not the answer to freedom all happiness and if you sit on the bus then you've got lots of people to ... way struggled\nBut that's the reason there are plenty of people who do see that individual lives in the being in the Congress something they value very highly\nOf I think a lot of people actually enjoy public drones but when it was well if we think about young people looked at them and choosing not to drive particularly if they live in cities where the public transport goods so is it I think is the others have said it's more important that you have good public ...\nSo you give people the real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoys the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and he says the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they what we can change systems have mobile home working people working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis is what is an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nBut well this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example of think of an aviation people love flying the gig on holidays the traveling for all kinds of reasons howling us would something like aviation safety in to a much greener well\nWell the um new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September I think lays out a way of a restructuring the global economy and the way that allows us great for freedom and great opportunities for a a more sustainable growth model\nAnd we have at the moment now there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems\nSo cold hard to abate sectors including things like shipping aviation\nSome forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on there\nAnd they were crossing our fingers witness and ...\n... people were working on this all across the world and moves development going on there's a report due out of the end of November Barbie energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development ... technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect of short flight ... being possible using ... from Port same wave law are long distance trucking\nJuveniles easing outside I think I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is among those it's going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that\nThey're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard took it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards from all walks of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nUs media reports say the Turkish government has audio and video recordings that they say proves that the missing Saturday ... was killed inside the Saturday comes she lives in Istanbul ten days ago\nThey say

advocates keeping the rise in global temperatures below one point five degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic consequences to the planet\nNeuro de as an adult is professor of climate change policy

challenges on the ... but I think you will seem to think that it's ... because the benefits are enormous but watch is the evidence that politicians actually want to do this ... the\nParis Agreement has really put wind in the sales of people like me who wanting to make sure that we do have\nAn urgent approach to climate change\nAnd I think I could really do attention to the ... sustainable finance we've all good investments whether that's in pension funds of savings and at the moment those are often invested in total destruction of technology and it's actually the shift those and in fact just politicians now we're framing a process whereby\nEverybody will have to move than money out so fossil fuels and tools a sustainable future instead so\nThere's a lot of power we have politically over the economy and we need to use that to shift probably just investment\nGiven given the kind of levels of of votes that policies like you'll get do you think there is public awareness public support for those kind of policies\nWould in terms of sustainable fun and so what Jonah ripple here in the parliament and it was supposed rights across you know Russia because of the right wing of the the people who were elected\nBut I didn't think this is an issue that's not exclusively to the ownership of one party will politicians are focused on this and that's how I managed to build a strong position really to support an an important and powerful position on sustainable finance\nSo let's try and understand the ... from them and\nBefore we pretend to the politics when we look at renewables are we working towards having enough renewables to power our ... our needs by themselves billboard\nWell in the u._k. for instance we are in making a very big switch\nTo a low carbon forms of power generation particularly driving coal of the system so what's happened since Ninety nine to use the u._k. has managed to reduce its annual emissions of greenhouse gases by moving forty percent of its economy is growing by more than Seventy percent so it has demonstrated that\nTackling climate change does not mean you have to sacrifice economic growth it off with a relatively modest\nCarbon price and wise investment in the development of renewables managed to drive coal almost completely opposite power generation system is set itself I\nConservatives talk give I think of getting cold down to zero by twenty twenty five or does mean investments out front but in many places the price of renewables per unit was just being coming down far quicker even but most economists have anticipated and then in many parts of the world it is now cheaper\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar is far cheaper than relying on coal or gas or the other forces\nJudea San Diego lots of good news that say renewables are going up but all they reliable enough and he plays the nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to touch we need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news however they've not been driving fossil fuels off the grid\nAnd and the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much\nBut just this week the government has given the go ahead to drill for fracking at the press to new roadside which is very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government forced them to accept the fracking on their location so very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just\nOn developing renewables and driving their prices down and incentivizing renewable production could we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development and the other two separate efforts why I don't think that we can count on cheap renewables\nIt's too much to ask of cheap renewables to drive fossil fuels off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking a look at another level and Laura Diaz\nOn we were in Norway last week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all of this was off the back of the sales of the oil and increasing the gas\nWell I think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and they see the one thing I report talks about energy talks about land use talks about CDs on talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables themselves cannot do everything it's of course easier to make these investments if there's a surplus however I must say that Norway is actually more some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to sink\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources um happening doing it um I think um we\nNeed to you know you you mentioned um retail at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that this one point five it's perfectly do uh well I Would like to kind of\nReal easy to just ... there's optimism that they also builds\nThere's enough of them but I think is really important to note that he's extremely hard that we need all the options that we need action from all sectors we need to finance community we need a policy community at all levels are ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need everything and I think\nThat is an enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics and the moment but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between America and China I mean there were so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these tactics and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or a four different policies\nMulti I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power out relatively clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy reporter for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind is about forty five dollars and make it will turn on the show when the twin daughters and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little town and that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the line from St Charles edition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's IPC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified\nI have also tried to show you that the problem is in slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well\nBut I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this little ...\nWell we're gonna have to find ways of of talking to this was that all the political system then there's no reason inherently why we can't\nDo this using all these political systems and China has a very different political structure but understand this pulled them very well because the centuries the same same issue for every country in the world\nThe risks associated with the impacts of climate change\nFar outweigh the costs of the investment required to avoid it it's just a question of how we get are we going to be difficult\nThey're all competing demands of the moment but I've I said this is really about what kind of future we want to credit for ourselves the world is moving the the global economy is changing regarding we're moving towards a population of nine billion you're not going to be able to stay in a world\nIf we don't climate better because the report was published on Mumbai is very clear we are moving down a path towards climate change that will mean more destruction around the world and it will lead to\nFor instance large displacements of populations around the world with the risk of conflict ... that's a world of conflict is not one of prosperity and peace\n... case it would it take something like that if you look back on the news for different reasons that twenty fifty migration crisis but it does it take a joke like that then the politicians to be able to tackle is to sell the hall messages to people within a democratic system\nWhen I think what migration points that to us is if there's great inequality then people will move and basically what what we do in other countries will impact and other countries and that will come back to us in the form of migration\nBut I think the fundamental political problem is that people do feel left behind\nAnd they feel left behind because we're living in an increasingly unequal society\nAnd so really we can start to sold to prove climate change as well as dealing with inequality 'cause it's the richest people who have the most impact whether we think about flowing reaching so much meat or driving and so on and that's also true in a global basis 'cause ... the global pool or taking more of the brunt of climate change they much less responsible for the causes of it [noise]\nLordy as an adult I I just wanted to comment on the question of democracy and environment and I think one of a one of my colleagues and cameras professor David ... has written about how democracy sat and not really well suited to attacking challenges that have not fully arrived of course we already have some of these challenges with and I think\nAh well this is because democracies are very good at benefits today costs in the future and in fact here we have a lot of costs today and kind of more future benefits but I think we can highlight in particular policy actions have the local level that the region level at the national level\nFrom the perspective of these benefits that we will have today or in the short term and we talked about some of these health benefits there's some of the call benefits that we can talk about some of them might be health so much of the jobs and let me bring joy\nThat back in ... we talking about benefits in the future\nIn developed countries people don't like having stuff taken away from them they don't want to know that they don't want to hear that they can't buy more clothes or and you call in a country like India where people are aspiring to those things are responding to the refrigerator then moved to bike and perhaps the call how honesty persuade them to say you know will you didn't want that stuff\nBasically people want to have a good life but they don't necessarily want to have throwaways things that you throw away every day so if you just take the case of ...\nThem onto plastics me throw we consume huge amounts of muscles feels as well as energy so the question is how do we use the existing culture in different countries in the world\nTo try to focus more on quality rather than quantity so it's not as if you want to really say that you should buy less but why can't you buy better quality cameras already pulled us and then in theory is that even really an option no but the last time he has the right of course didn't prove his life all her life\nAnd I think the question is much more about the rich the question of inequality was brought up we know that you know one percent of the slump elation seems to have as much as the remaining Ninety nine percent and that's also true for India do you need much more equality within the Indian society as well and more sharing of the wealth\nI won't talk to each of you a final question all begin with you you're in ten years time if we're going to follow those recommendations and there were pools are the findings the report we would need to be well on our way to reduce ... emissions so do you believe given what we know now about\nA ... on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nSo just reports is really off for by the governments and mobile feeding to political pro says up to the end of year and over the coming years governments have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table\nSo I really do hope that governments take into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on the track towards reducing global emissions\nLaura in ten years time\nI think if we have countries that put in place you know the politically Bible second best policy is to create coalitions of winners that reviews that costs to search that invest in innovation and that emphasize nickel benefits maybe [laughter]\n...\nI don't think we have any choice but to believe we can because there were tons of it is we just give up and then it's all do so on one doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it\nMore people have to engage with politicians and said to them we want to choose the future we have because in the future not just for the people here and now it's a kind of well we want to leave talk children or grandchildren I think most people along the will to be a better place for their children are grown children than they currently have\nJoined the group the court cases in India and in the U.S by young children are often that governments there doing enough so I think that when you see a whole sees all four cases where people who've tried to put pressure on their governments will need much more leadership\nPolicy entrepreneurs and social movements to get this going to be desperately need the help of the ... ...

like this had the power to bring down a politician even a whole government\nOn Twitter President Trump himself that he gave it his attention that was just a single tweet and what she called it quote boring but what about American vote is\nHe's the view from a town in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump San Antonio in Texas\nThe New York times is regularly putting out I think incorrect information so my first inclination is to just not believe anything I say\nAnd do you think that's like an opinion that a lot of no never finish her yesterday what if the allegations straight up\nThen I Would want to look into it and I reconsider and you know maybe changed my mind but so far the New York times has been zero for zero I already had a very low opinion of Trump and\nStill have a low opinion of Trump bend the article I feel like he he is just like you can do\nWhatever he wants an article don't matter it wouldn't change my opinion of him if someone's on the fence about Trump at this point I'm not sure that this investigation and change and I mean there's probably enough information out there for you to make up your mind one way or the other\nSo nah nope all that\nDoes then Craig is one of the New York times journalist who spent the last year and a half of their lives delving into the details of President Trump and his family's tax if as to how much would she put into it\n[noise] when was it no it was march two thousand and Seventeen Eighteen months ago\nAnd Rachel Maddow who has a talk show and the United states she had three pages of Donald Trump's two thousand and five tax returns and what was striking to us was that he had actually made a hundred and thirty five million dollars in two thousand five\nAnd we were just shocked and so the next morning started this odyssey of digging into his finances that ended up with the story that we ran\nAnd it's an incredibly detailed story fourteen thousand would article was it difficult to take that deep I mean it all to get these huge get the documents you needed\nIt was like having a million puzzle pieces thrown into the middle of the times square and are being asked to put them back together we started out trying to figure out that really simple question and it led us to Fred Trump Donald Trump's father who died in Nineteen Ninety nine and four or five years later the Trump children sold Fred Trump's\nEmpire and it was a massive sale that went through very quietly to another real estate developer in New York\nAnd not let us to just think wow like Fred Trump had a lot more money than we've been thinking it through public documents\nWe were able to piece together how Fred Trump starting when Donald Trump was just three started establishing trust for his children so he'd made them his landlords he sort of putting land and to trust that Donald Trump bone and then he would be paying Donald in his siblings rent\nAnd then we started making calls and we were just incredibly fortunate where we had sources who gave us access to a thousand and thousands of pages of confidential\nFinancial data including two hundred separate tax returns\nAnd the results you know who the Russian is really forensic is there a reason why you went into that amount of detail\nWe felt given the allegation that we're accusing sitting president of tax fraud that we owed it to our readers to document that as well as we could\nGo out and she said that the accusation is so serious you have to be forensic and what you're saying\nYeah the New York times to accuse the sitting president\nOf multiple cases of tax fraud has never hop than it's incredibly serious what all the legal consequences you think now for the president I Know that the city in the state or looking at now various taxes that could be owed both on a city and state level\nSome of it for criminal liability has passed the statute of limitations but there could still be civil fines coming the Internal Revenue service could also open it you have to remember now that the person ultimately in charge of the IRS as Donald Trump ... I'm sure as a challenge\nThere should be right and wrong and all of this and if they did something wrong\nI Hope somebody who's able to show it in a way that results in at least back taxes being paid on the money that they do\nDo you think that Iraq school will change anyone's opinion about Trump intends of his support base\nI don't know I mean I [noise] I sort of try not to write into a political ends effect that way I think what it does is it sets the record straight the Donald Trump got a lot more from his father than you knew you said so many times you know what I'm self made billionaire and my father mainly gave me moral support\nThat line was repeated so often that it has just been repeated a stocked but we were able to pin down that it was at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars that was transferred\nBut at the New York times you quote use of the fact that because the White House is so antagonistic when it comes to the New York times that the sort of default response is to be well\nHate the president that will they will run this kind of stuff yeah I don't want to be players wouldn't say that it's not political 'cause we're we're writing into a political world but it's just not what we do\nWashington is going to say what they are going to say and and that's their job so I just sort of try to figure out on our and how we can ... get stories to publication that we're proud of them that are right\nNow\nShe's on Craig narrow the New York times for some the absence of a political fall out to the New York times story underlines just how much the will to finance media and politics have changed in the past decade\nJohn Otis has just started a new job as senior editor at the financial news says Bloomberg in New York before that he spent twenty nine years writing about finance and markets for the Financial Times newspaper\nHe wrote a swan song obstacle for the F T as he left ruining the loss of trust in traditional media immune response to the New York times story ... is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the uh rights crisis you've seen trust in the major in the most important institutions that go up the color you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that plane leave the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was Bruce on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway [noise]\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had his little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and preparedness to believe actual\nEmpirical facts lots of that's possibly does come from the rise of social means yet but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established means zero ... stood in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that\nWith my tape recorder space in the door that she has now than it had on the almost at the end of the salmon it

... category for hurricane at their doorstep and\nParticularly scary for rather than accept the handle Florida because they've never experienced a category for storm is the first time it's ever happened there so yeah I think the fact that it didn't have to fight so rapidly they kind of catch some people off guard\nAnd I've been looking at some of the images of Mexico beach for example and whole rows of houses and buildings just flat and\nIt's it's awful people are comparing it to what happened in Nineteen Ninety year with Hurricane Andrew and homestead Florida near Miami because everything was just left holding it looks like a bomb went off they're looking at that station it's just\nLike sell off or the you know how people recover from that they have to complete meat retail it from scratch\nWell should they I guess the question arises if this kind of hard work and become so intense on might be more frequent then perhaps Mexico beach is a place where you shouldn't rebuild\nAnd and that's a great point that for a million dollar question a lot of scientists are encouraging people die that rebel because like you said they're right there by the water storm surge that your number one killer ... so yeah you can rebel you can try to rebuild stronger but\nWhat really got to stand up against you ran into that category more category ... and\nBut it's human nature people want to live by the water so how do you prevent them from doing that because I think as long as people are going to get paid for Iran they're probably going to let people continue to build

you say we expect herbicides detailed plan and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of

what do we know so far\nWe don't know that much according to the uh anonymous or intelligence officials who spoke to the Washington Post they were able to access audio and video recordings that\nApparently record the moments before and during that Jamal ... violent death\nInside the consulate now Turks made these recordings they've not publicly talked about these recordings that have been some whispers of recordings but the word in the Washington Post story and in intelligence circles is that the Turks don't want to\nAdmit that they have these tapes because they\nYeah it's just bad practice to let every consulate in Istanbul and al ... embassy in Ankara now that their offices are about which they should probably assume anyway uh we also just heard that a delegation of Saudi

disagree with every single thing that\nThe previous person said the Turks have\nReleased a lot of evidence already they're releasing it in dribs and drabs most likely for diplomatic reasons because they're trying to get some concessions out of Saudi Arabia to try to see what they can pull a in a sort of Machiavellian way out of this I think that\nMPs wind is he is very reckless young man has done unbelievable things in the past before that included kidnapping the prime minister of Lebanon and putting a much of the Saudi royal family under house arrest in prison\nIs not beyond the realm of possibility that in a state of anger at something democracy hokey sad or wrote a heat may have ordered this operation\nProfessor cars just young ... what would be the point to it being a stunt\nIs not a question of the some or noticed though I Am not position to know exactly what is your previous speaker now that's\nThat's a little bit of ... the Turkish government is the president has said that they have done is the kind of comfortable with the evidence or shut up is as simple as that\nWhile I'm under the sun\nFor me whenever he is not going to get us anywhere and will not know whether she

is not a place where it's not easy to be a journalist at least noticed Turkish journalist ... so ... what do you think the outcome of this might be in the regional politics\nI think that right now as I was mentioning earlier the Turkish and the Saudi officials are meeting and there's a very good chance that turkey is going to ask for a price for scraping this under the rug as the Saudis have suggested to the Trump Administration they would like to do\nI think that prices going to be very high it might be something like restore\nGood relations with Qatar which is a an ally of turkey and locked in a bitter rivalry with Saudi Arabia it might be having something to do with the economy will have to sit in the next few hours\nUm ... what does it do to relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia looking especially at what's going on in Syria\nWhere are you going to get even more complicated than it was the first will not be true or\nBuy a taxi or ... or ... or any individual and I

because it has been interviewing the south Korean president Moon Jae in who's won't there might be more diplomatic bumps and bruises that's the phrase on the way things are looking good eventually it says that will be an agreement to declare a formal end to the Korean War between the United states and North Korea\nOr from some ... ... it's not for the end of war declaration I had ample discussions with President Trump as well as other U.S officials on this issue\nWho wish and if North Korea takes such measures in the end of war declaration would be a political statement would announce that the longstanding hostile relations between killing young and Washington have ended\nSo we would need to have this declaration at the earliest possible date and I believe there was a shed understanding between Washington and so the guarding the viewpoint so I Believe it's on the amount of time and I'm not sure of dates and we will be able to sign this\nAnd that means that that accelerates warming even more this is true for almost all the different frozen parts of the Arctic is that asked me change them it makes it harder for them to do their job of helping to keep his cool\nSo yeah I think that's something that we're really trying to get across in the series of stories is that no matter where you live on the planet the Arctic affects you\nSo we're going to hear a lot about ice and why what happens to it it's so important uh but the stores were going to hear from you and me it's more than just a is right [noise]\nFor a million people live in the Arctic and they have a front row seat to all these changes\nI really wanted to try to understand what climate change looks like an Arctic through the eyes of the people who live there and um after spending all this time in the eight different Arctic countries I really had my eyes opened to the way that climate change intersects with all kinds of other issues up there\nFor instance I spoke with ... with the ... council in Alaska\nShe was one of many people I talked to had information that kind of surprised me I asked her a question that I kind of thought I knew the answer to and I was wrong what would you define as some of the biggest threat to people in the Arctic right now I'm calling I station\nColonization I was not expecting that\nYeah this is something that was a surprise to me too but I heard over and over 'em throughout the Arctic there are a lot of indigenous cultures and almost all of them have gone through some sort of colonization process\nOne of the groups that I spend a lot of time with our the sunny these are the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia and western Russia and I spoke to one woman named Charlotte ...\nI Am Sammy and to my country ... me but it is colonized it is divided into four countries Norway seed in Finland and Russia so we are kind of stateless\nSo if climate change and colonization of the legacy of it anyway are two big challenges for people in the Arctic right now what are they want from the rest of us who have been colonizer and caused the climate crisis to begin with\nI think that what most people that I spoke with in the Arctic one is they they just want to be included in the conversation about what's going on in the Arctic I think some of the legacy of colonization\nMeans that some of the people that are most impacted by these changes you know really have to fight to get a seat at the table in terms of all the different conversations happening around how to respond to climate change\nAnd um I think that just listening and taking perspectives seriously if people who live in the north is a great starting point\nAmy Martin of the threshold podcast talking with the world's Marco warming any serious kicks off next Monday on the
