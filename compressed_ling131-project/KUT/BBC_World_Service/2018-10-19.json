California um and I live on the edge of folk green farm enforced [noise] my question is there's a larger question do which is how are we going to manage the forest and the future to minimize global warming and climate change\nSo no carbon it's going up from the fires were scored and we're\nGonna have to look very closely at thinning are force in a way that protects wildlife habitat that creates a good soil conditions for water run off into our streams\nSo I think there's some things that we will have to do in forest management that can actually be done in a way that actually improves the carbon seek restoration and helps us meet our climate change goals we\nHaven't talked about watersheds before we go to the ... what happens to watersheds after a fire because people don't realize that your water comes from a hill of you know forest somewhere\nWell sometimes when water she has a burns who barely can be really impactful the watersheds you know there was a few years ago we had a fire called the ... it was in federal Sierra Nevada\nTurned out to be two hundred fifty thousand acres you know the first entity that called about the room fire as concerned with San Francisco water and power because the room fires had touchy\nHad such a reservoir is a huge reservoir there basically ... San Francisco and a lot of the bay area so it was a water managers that we're most concerned about the return fire because maybe hitting touchy\nTowards ... running into the ashes running into the water erosion ash you know going into the reservoirs clogging them changing their water quality\nStandards but the other part of this is actually sometimes if you have fire working more ecologically appropriately\nWe've done some work in the Sierra Nevada we see that actually one fires allowed to Bernie semi national park for forty five years we actually see that we're seeing slightly increases in water coming out of these watersheds\nAnd actually that is something that we don't see in places that don't have any type of fire at all so I think there's a synergy between climate change forest health and water that we might be able to explore in the state to actually make a difference because\nIf I think about natural resources in the state I put water is probably the top of the pile\nYeah we don't have the California Dream without the water moving around let's go to our next question\nDoes he in your reporting and traveling have you learned of any other countries that are experiencing this in particular and how can they use California as an example\nI was actually in Sweden earlier this summer when they had all their way out there is going on and it was really interesting to see their response to that\nThey're really on the ... the wildfires every summer and this summer it practically the entire northern region it seems on fire and they were getting resources from Italy and Spain and Portugal and so a lot of countries end up looking to California\nAnd our model here with Cal Fire to see if they need larger state wide mechanisms or a country like mechanisms to paddle these places\nBecause what we do have here in the state has their unique it's not quite like anywhere else how so and that we have Cal Fire and it says like fire fighting AJC last question welcome yes my name is\n... and my husband and I were involved in the Oakland firestorm at lost our house alone with lots of other folks and that was twenty five years ago\nSo my question is what\nMitigating things do you think has been done for the future and just as an aside one of my neighbors who lives down the street has been notified that her fire insurance is being cancelled\nJerry Brown also lives up there but he says at his age you can take the\nRisk [laughter] got Stevens Ninety One fire what a day that was my first semester at UC Berkeley and it really was transformative when you think about what it did to people's lives you know houses last\nWe've learned from it but we've also hadn't done enough you know I think you know California got fifty eight counties every county has land management plans someone the state starts to get down on those counties you start talking about the state putting more requirements\nMore land zoning requirements more building requirements to build here there's a real tension between the counties and the state trying to get into their turf\nBut unless we do something like that we're basically going to be chased out 'til forever Australia's done a lot better than this Australia's a place where this has done a little bit more systematically people have learned and they're actually reducing risk in wildland urban interface and I have to commend them for that and I do think the state has to step up and actually\nGet a little bit more involved in this and probably get some people who are upset but we just can't continue to keep building like we are in places in between\nGreg Dalton is talking about Ronald hires in ... which which for the\nPresident of the California forestry association which represents the timber industry [noise] he is a former state assembly Memphis and the town\nLiving Johnson is a staff writer for the San Francisco chronicle we're covering wildfires is now a fulltime and year round beat\nAnd Scott Stephens the professor of fire science at the University of California Berkeley He's written about managing fire and for it and it's changing\nAll our climate lung conversations subscribe to our podcast and our website climate one died or where you'll also find photos and video clips and more\nIf you like the program please let us know bike riding a review on I tens or wherever you get your podcasts and join us next time for another conversation about energy economy in the environment [noise]\nClimate was a project of the commonwealth club of California Kelly Pennington directs her audience engagement\nTiger readers our producer the audio engineers are ... and Justin Norton any Chelsea Devon stroller which includes showed at at the show I'm Greg dose and the executive producer and host\nThe commonwealth club CEOs Dr Gloria Duffy\nIn association with ...

the future of the very political policies who's deployed it\nAs the U.S midterm elections approach will be examining whether identity politics ... so we're in pilots democratic societies [laughter] that's the real story from the BBC coming up off the Denise\nAnd then the same way actually into politics as quickly come to be appropriated by people who are on ... so I I agree but originally it was pejorative\nBut now there's this phrase which ... which is all politics is identity politics and that's one of the coal claims of people who want to defend the motive politics and I think it's an important claim because it is important to be wrong\nAt the very hard to do they call for preventative democracy is the idea of it we can strive for comment for public good but it's an idea of something but we have in common as citizens of the country irrespective\nOf our religion of our skin color which part of the country you're from or what kinds of economic interests you might have and I think we give up on that idea altogether and the phrase all politics is identity politics does give up on that phrase we're in a lot of prop ... do you see these things right\nI think it's pointing out that the people who often make planes on the basis of abstract universe cells are abstract commonalities are not lacking in identity I think it's simply pointing out more as a basic fact as um\nLionel said were born into groups um and very often what do we choose to or\nNot to I live with these groups we get treated in ways that are gender and why is that a racialized in ways that have to do with us\nSo we can really all about the fantasy land where we choose what we want to be on you know I'd be lovely but actually are we moving toward that should be short I don't accept the ... it all on examined binary between commonality indifference or we can I write that commonality through debt threatens\nMost civil rights that we enjoy today will fought for and they were fought for\nOn the basis off groups wanting to be part of the common good\nWhen I go to the same time many groups age right in different sides used to find themselves primarily against other groups rather than saying really what they're about and how that might relate to\nThe other show but I might not be about civil rights groups that are not ... they're not saying oh we want to be simply different and they are able to look to what's coming out like through the difference is whether they are such a way that it's not about who you are or who you identify with the way you stand\nIn the larger structure of society\nAdrian ... short it is about ... aren't the same time if you compare the civil rights movement and say you know Martin Luther king and others\nTo some of the movements today what's the big difference Martin Luther king kept on saying this is about being Americans about all people in America being able to partake of our common life\nShow ... to democracy and sell them whereas a lot of groups today primarily say we want to claim out different and we have nothing in common with all this and that's where the ... well yeah of course black lives matter of keep on saying we have to be treated differently because\nNow I live in Manhattan and I don't I don't think that and then second I Want to do is hit just hear the voices of ... matches campaign as in Chicago\n[laughter] [noise]\nVegetarian why Kerry Kerry and John Kerry is on the brink all bought out and in practice [laughter]\n\n\nThat some of the ... of a campaign is who are protesting against police brutality pre out how would you define that place than in the spectrum\nIt's very clear they're saying exactly the opposite of what a tree and just sat there saying we are being treated differently we'll being singled out by the police and it is only one black lives matter can we say that all lives matter\nSo they say we want to be not singled out we want to not be treated as different\nAnd you know and Martin Luther king this very sanitized kind of white should've Martin Luther king that floats around\nMartin Luther king didn't just say well we all want to be Americans one called me all the American he was not a he was not button all in that way he understood that certain groups were excluded from what was pretending to be a universal idea and he was saying that in order to achieve equality of citizenship African\nAmericans hatched a such that rights to civil right yeah I\nMean I think I have three ... you're the one who are making is making it slightly of simplified binary because you either describing a position which a race doesn't matter at all and we're just against injustice and be abstract and we don't recognize his tropical ways in which we obviously has been instantly as racial injustice\nUm ooh everything needs to become about identity and but we sort of lose out of sight ... society where met us led I think it's I don't think ... between how Martin Luther king and by the way bronco bomber talked about those things\nAnd how some people in the space of identity politics I'll talk about it is it they said\nWhy should we care for example when African Americans are being discriminated against and how do we argue about that the majority population and one of the ancestors you claim to care about universal principles to claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see that these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian time beyond we have some common as Americans and that is the right way I think to put his name was ... ...\nBy off for an ad on piled high density politics and I was given black lives matter to you from the accepts that we just listened to that black lives matter will not say we are different\nI drew past while the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy in an economy that is actually open tools to the point of our identity politics as very exclusive was a sense of belonging that everyone can shatter needs to redo the thing\nAnd I can I throw in a a different elements all of this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say a civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that what lake we're athlete with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is an American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't pulse\nOf yourself as a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character of the conversation that's being hat on line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties\nIs a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward predation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth\nTo white identity politics\nIs it them enough ... that actually is destructive if there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf that record bent on us it is one that has been set up by the majority [noise] this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nSet protests going on in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim\nNarratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege being coded as oppression and that's the difference between actually being oppressed\nAnd actually feeling that your last ... outrageous\nThough is that rather an important point Adrian passes it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nWell I think the problem is that you have on the one hand technocratic leads believing abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of my knowledge the majority of responses to that and I think none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim on whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBy the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice that affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always a painting to what we have in common bottom done just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some don't recognize\nThe vets exactly in fact walk the beauty movement did they said look this is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what\nActual sexual ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but he's real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it but I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nPresident Trump has said he now believes the Saturday journalist Jamal ...

politics\nAnd I'm joined by Ashton monk Adrian pops Lionel Shriver and the embargo Paul and when the sun is tough we talked about what lies behind the rise of our awareness of identity politics whether or not it's new I think remains debatable\nBut if we move away from that and think a bit more about the impact is fracturing will regroup paying of people and causes and its effects on traditional politics\nLet's consider the changing political landscape that the election of Donald Trump immediately comes to mind and also traditional Republican or a conservative but certainly each should end you view of politics [noise]\nDoes that view those people who backed him [noise] does that voice come at the expense of others ...\nWell I think the um Trump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to a identity politics and it it in a reaction against it the shrill note that I observed earlier\nIs alienating to the majority and if I saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the proportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims of discrimination in the United states is shockingly high\nAnd of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous but it's you know that's what they feel\nAnd it's partly the results of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against and um they look at what is often a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomena as only coming from this small campus movement\nBut it hasn't helped and this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely infected the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's the kind of things to say I'm very struck by the way in which he does in fact a certain form of white identity politics um that Brostrom to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority of the majority is playing\nA is being made to play a role that identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how fat snap on how the truth matters and how fake news has a problem [laughter]\nSuddenly feelings hurt feelings of the majority become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what else feelings if I feel that\nThere are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the staff affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people [laughter] nowhere near proportional into academia for instance\nThe affirmative action is a sad thing but it just that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality where the facts what is the truth\nWell on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really states just to see as river sexism the point is that racism and sexism are about palace tucked [laughter]\nOkay so you can't really punch up well you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally\nNational races so a few points here first the Fort unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and the democracies you have to ... somewhat above the feelings of the majority because otherwise the booth with people like Donald Trump and but as a disaster for everybody especially for the most vulnerable so\nWhat I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections around ideals that are going to help us come together society and help us fight discrimination rather than ... and so the reason to have a feeling of people\nIs that in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a political\n... is a key facts we can't we talked to and ... and the name of the\nLandlord and Frank I'm Talking about in country and the other thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think it's up to ...\n... did you find a counter that with different kinds of I didn't know what I'm saying that well actually I did not do precisely shows in my mouth I mean I didn't finish to bring you about ... precisely shows what the problem is with the conception of politics but says we're going to fight for our group and for our side and we don't care about anything else Priya\nSo we shouldn't have affirmative action because that upsets white people for the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised groups fair access to write in order that the majority or not they hook\nOutside but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including boss the majority of people of color in the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on behalf of\nCamp she wants to move away from that point and bring you in Adrian we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the established policies\nActually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should unite the\n[noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites establishments simply on representative\nThat often based on any groups and yes often do you watch any groups but then I was in groups which actually bend bring about the system is unjust also father why people and many more so it's not the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou kind of ... working class of populations in certain countries that have simply not being the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all the kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last forty years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um I find that the W. W. see either white working class is a very interesting construct\nWatching sausage as as a whole have not done while I'm working to offer as as a whole on not white that they too white people but they're all working tosses who have been at the shop end of ... near liberalism of capitalism if pressed\nTheir ... because they're working ... not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white working class it was out doing\nDisproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working class which\nIs an interesting and important point I wanted to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in the valley area\nWhat happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades found itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been\nHemorrhage fights the greens on one side and the anti immigrant asked the on the other meanwhile the S. P.
