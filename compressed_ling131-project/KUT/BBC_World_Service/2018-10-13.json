{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Effect you mentioned that you built a table this is Julian university marketing professor Daniel mulch on maybe it came out a little bit crooked probably your wife or your neighbor would see it for what it is you know probably a shoddy piece of work from the ship\nA shoddy piece of wood and ship because some of us are not necessarily talented at building our own furniture in fact if you go online you can find plenty of videos of people struggling to put together that ikea coffee table dresser\nI don't really understand when they're part is I don't feel like they have the seed we thought we did\nBut even though building to fund that ... can be a painful chore people seem to really like the outcome\nTo you that cable might seem really great because you're the one who created it is the fruit of your labor in that is really the idea behind the acute effect is if we come to over value the things that we have created ourselves\nIn fact the psychological bias might actually be an important part of a key as business model\nAnd what you think about a year is that I Can't gives you good furniture for a low cost because they afloat lots of the costs onto their consumers the assembly costs\nBut in fact we were just as challenging that idea and said it was actually a psychological benefit behind is that actually if people might end up liking furniture more because they've built it it's not so much it costs for the benefit that they get to build their own furniture\nDaniels in his coauthors did a series of experiments to test this hypothesis they brought on as years into the lab and gave them either a lego car pre assembled or give them that goes and instructions and tool the participants to build a car themselves then they asked the volunteers how much what you pay to keep you on like a car\nAnd what we find is that the people who build their own leg goes not only are willing to pay more to keep their assembled leg goes but also when we asked him how proud of their of their own creations they tend to be prouder of their legs in mind you these are lego that are designed to five to seven year olds but nonetheless it seems to be some competent some some fried associated with wants creation\nEven for basic things is building legos\nThe reception is replicated the study using other products like ikea furniture and the effect was the same\nPeople who spent time and effort building something felt proud of what they had built sand in love with it and we're waiting to pay lots of money to keep the things they'd built from the perspective of a rational economists this doesn't make much sense\nJust students might be willing to pay twice as much money to buy the exact same lego car if they just finished building lego car then if the legal car was given to them rebuild\nSo why make people value something more after building it themselves\nCompared to bind the same products made by someone else for half the cost of our hypothesis\nWas that people tend to use products to signal valued identities to both themselves into editors and we know the identity of people really care about is showing that you're competence is sort of one of the basic human motivation and so we had positive sides of people use self\nMade products as a way to signal competence both themselves and to to ... you know having just build the table or having just build the book gays that bookcase I've completed products I'm acting in a sense of a badge of my own personal competition I completed it differ\nI Know I'm a competent person and moreover I can just play this product a signal that identity is competent identity to others\nAnd so we have to say that it was the skillings of competence associated with the products that led to their increasing probably ...\nTo test the theory that people's feelings of competence was behind the IKEA effect the research has had some participants think about other qualities they might value in themselves besides competent things like honesty more intelligent humor basically the idea was if we make it less important for people to demonstrate competence\nDo they still over value their own creations\nSo we found that the effect disappeared ... when we did jak manipulation so once competence wasn't that important to people\nPeople are our participants no longer seemed to get much rather than creating their own product against or just seeing that that the reason why we tend to like her creations is because we use them as a waste the no competence both to ourselves and to other\nHere's the flip side of that coin you can make the IKEA effect stronger by getting people to question that competence in one experiment Daniel and his colleagues gave participants math problems\nTo solve before asking them to build an ikea project if the problems with difficult lots of people fail to solve them now volunteers became much more likely to want to demonstrate that competence to the ikea building project\nThat participants who at least temporarily had their sense of competence threatened to got to a very difficult math questions\nTends to be more willing to build their own products so when we when we survey data ... where do you prefer to have a ... product that comes to rebuild or the exact same product that comes on bills and you build it yourself\nThose who've had got difficult math problems and we're feeling someone incompetent at the time seem more willing they were much more likely to want to build their product themselves and therefore innocence restore their sense of competence through this activity\nI mean give me the number share I mean was this a big effect which is a small effect I mean what happens when people feel bad compared to when they don't feel that\n[noise] so so what we found is that about a third of the people want us to build the ikea book shelf in the control condition when they weren't made to feel bad and just never went up to about sixty percent when they were made to feel bad so so significantly larger number of people want us to do is\nThe IKEA effect and implicit eco tourism might seem at first blush to be interesting and amusing but not terribly significant but the more I thought about this the more I saw the potential applications just as we can be drawn to those who have the same book the U.S house or the same name as us\nWe might also be more inclined to help people who look like us or sound like us or live near us\nLet's say you're a congressperson who's drafted a particular piece of legislation your commitment to that bill might outweighs importance to the public\nWell let's say you're a president who starts a war after years of investing your time and effort to prosecute that who are you may find it difficult to accept the evidence that you made a mistake\nIt's fine to gauge lovingly in the mirror and defeat invested in our own ideas about

but what about the political changes that are needed to tackle rising temperatures according to the un report heat waves droughts and floods could be the future and much of the wells if we can't keep the s temperature rise to one point five degrees Celsius\nBut only for pet to make dramatic changes to the way we live for the sake of the time it will in the public agreed to pay for the switch from producing fossil fuels to clean renewables\nSocieties than it used to a ... of growth and prosperity they're willing to give up causing meet for the good of the F\nWill rapidly growing economies except to break on rising living standards to tackle climate change until the Democratic politicians have the will and the incentive to jump in such a tough policy agenda that's the real story from the BBC coming up off to the news\n\nThe report is also not prescriptive in the way that we should be going about these reports clearly spelled out to different choices in the strategies that we want to pursue to to achieve net zero global emissions and these strategies are important because depending on which strategy we follow\nThat can be positive or negative consequences for older societal goals that ... that we set ourselves rethink here about\nA eradication of poverty food security biodiversity and so on so it is really important that while keeping in mind that are about keeping in mind the end goal of reaching net zero emissions by ... century\nWon't really approached this from a from a smart and an integrated way\nOne last thought Ben big things to think about but what about the cost will cost estimates it in order to achieve this\nThe cost of this of achieving theirs are actually relatively small if you look at the overall picture\nMuch of it are investments and investments in the economy to provide jobs\nThey also provide many older co benefits they provide clean air clean water\nBiodiversity and so on so we just\nReally hard and and the report does not provide a comprehensive cost them estimate of this so it is really hard to give it a one fix number it is however clear that it can be done without jeopardizing economic growth or welfare or sustainable development and I think that is a really clear it a message that comes out of the report\nThat just finally we are talking about trillions of dollars governments like over the next until twenty fifty\nInvestments if you want to call it that of trillions of dollars up to ... year he thank you very much for now there is plenty to think about that some tough choices ahead and the question of many people may now be ... what does it mean for us standard of living\nIn the developed world is the inevitable that will have to take a drop in living standards the way we live how we live in order to achieve some of these targets and in countries that are growing rapidly what these changes put that development at risk cilia Steinbeck or your an ecological economist to the songs that like to you\nSo from my perspective just to add a bit too that your previous a discussion with theory I think the cost of inaction far outweigh the costs of action on climate change\nAnd climate breakdown really because we're talking about as we're talking about averting a terrible catastrophes I think an investment is exactly the way to think about it\nAnd I think we also have to be very realistic about the kinds of things we're trying to preserve we're trying to preserve safe human existence on the planet we're trying to preserve the lives in chances of among the most vulnerable people as well because the most vulnerable populations is already poor\nOr or elderly or have more difficult circumstances will be the most affected the first affected so I think that that has to be your absolute priority and from that perspective economic cost is necessary it's not that it it's just in an absolutely necessary investment\nNow of course they're all going to have to be very very big changes in our hopefully going to talk about this quite a bit um including the fact that we're talking about energy rejections so not just energy efficiency that reductions in total levels of energy demand\nEspecially in the interim because we've really lost his problem to too late we've really been delayed by all kinds of problems um such as a climate denial is and influences a big fuss lobbies so but we usually have reduction\nOf ... of of energy use you're talking about people getting out of that cause and walking or cycling or using public ... for an\nAbsolutely absolutely and so especially in the industry and we are talking about reducing our energy is considerably um however uh the research shows in my research and particularly I'm as well as others that energy consumption does not necessarily mean living standards so it is possible to have a perfectly good quality of life\nAnd have lower energy use but the infrastructure has to be there the infrastructure has to be in place such as public transit ... cities that are safe to cycle and walk in the hat or a\nLower ideas on a don't do you think that people living in cities as they do now especially in the developed well I'm going to see it quite as positively is that\nWell in fact what we know that people in cities have generally lower carbon footprint\nWhen compared to people who don't even see the if I think just in my experience coming from Cambridge this morning I was biking behind a bus and there was black smoke coming out of the bus I think that in you know it's easy to see particularly on these area called benefits from changing most have transportation what\nSome of the state today benefits are from review saying things like oil consumption\nBut in terms of the ordinary people and you say to them if someone who drive to work every day holiday going to feel about getting out of that car and trying to use public transport it's a tough off\nI think ah even though we have a short period of time um\nI Would argue that we need a combination of top down leadership in terms of what neither side they see the level of economic level and at the national level deal and we also need lots of my campaign send movements that try to convey some of these cold benefits of changing the way in which\nWork but I think that you're right that the notion that from one day to the other we're going to get people in London to completely change the way they go to work for example or in other places\nAnd enough instance London's about example because actually they release in ... the public transport infrastructure in place there are many other cities where it simply doesn't exist\nIndeed so we have these long timescales that are required to putting the infrastructure as you are you in a until you mentioned um but we need to get started today so I think the fact that these hard ah precisely me is that we need to get started today with the flow of top down and bought 'em up\nMolly still Kay says so far we've had from people who are thinking about this in an academic way if you like you've got to try and sell this to the public isn't it like ... to ... to the Christmas\nActually didn't agree I mean I think I was getting people to get us that Cohen still sitting in a traffic jams she quit and appealing us and if if lots of people go to the ... and we're on the bus it wouldn't be the traffic down so everybody get to it folks to suit you know the private ... such a freedom all happiness and if he sits on the bus then you've got lots of people to ... to ... waste shovel\nBut that's the reason that there are plenty of people who do see that individual is being in the car or something they value very honestly\nI think a lot of people actually enjoy public transport when it was well if we think about young people know lifted the ma choosing not to drive that security if they live in cities where the public ... good so I said I think is the others have said it's more important that you have good public Jones bull\nSo you give people a real choice to make I didn't think anybody really enjoy the moon and commute switching for two hours in a lot of traffic and it says the same about having to commute to work you know why do people\nLive so far from where they would we can change systems have mobile home working\nPeople working full day week so they have moved on relationships the kinds of things that make them happy because the way the economy's working at the moment is actually creating a mental health crisis\nAs well as an energy crisis so you know we can rethink those systems and people will be actually much happier\nWith all of this is a very particular view of of the world and how we might want to live in it but let's take another example think about aviation people love flying gig on holidays the traveling for all kinds of reasons howling us would something like aviation fish in to a much greener well\nWell the um new climate economy which is a reporter was published in September ... lays out a way of a restructuring the global economy in the way that allows us great for freedom and great for opportunities for a a more sustainable growth model\nUm we have at the moment about there are going to be in many of these places like the power system we know more or less how to do it there are going to be some different more difficult problems\nSo cold hard to abate sectors including things like shipping aviation\nSome forms of manufacturing for to steal but there's great technological development going on there\nAnd there's the crossing our fingers and this and ...\nNo no the people working on this all across the world and there's development going on there's a report you out of the end of November of the energy transition commission which will lay out what we can do so on aviation for instance the development of tree technology is not happening so quickly\nThere is a prospect offshore flights being possible using ... technology support same wave law a long distance trucking juveniles\nEasing outside they I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that\nThey're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the ... fall we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard and so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nThe former Malaysian deputy prime minister and opposition to the um my brain is facing the

D as an adult is professor of climate change policy billboard is from the ground and ... to climate change Judy assigned to ... is an ex an ecological economics I'm only ... case has any pie is from the u._k. green policy welcome back to you will\nWe discuss the challenges and the ... but I think you will seem to think that it possibly do it all because the benefits are enormous\nBut Walsh is the evidence that politicians actually want to do this ... case say the Paris Agreement\nHas really put wind in the sales of people like me who wanting to make sure that we do have\nAn urgent approach to climate change\nAnd I think I really do attention to the idea of sustainable finance we've all good investments whether that's in pension funds will savings and at the moment those are often invested in total destruction technologies and it's actually to shift those and in fact as politicians now we're framing approach to slip by everybody will have to move\nIn the house of fossil fuels and tools a sustainable future instead so there's a lot of power we have politically over the economy and we need to use that to shift probably just investment\nGive it given the kind of levels of of the policies like you'll get do you think there is public awareness public support for those kind of policies\nWill in terms of sustainable finance I went to another report here in the parliament and it was supposed to cross you know really took us to the right wing of the the people who were elected but I didn't think this is an issue that's not exclusively the the ownership of one party will politicians are focused on this and that's how I managed to build a strong\n... really to support an an important and powerful position on sustainable finance\nSo let's try and understand the ... for a moment before we returned to the politics when we look at renewables are we working towards having enough renewables to power our ... our needs by themselves billboard\nWell and you pay for instance we've been making a very big switch\nTo a low carbon forms of power generation particularly drive and coal off the system so what's happened since Nineteen Ninety used to do you have managed to reduce its annual emissions of greenhouse gases by more than forty percent of its economy is growing by more than Seventy percent so it has demonstrated that\nTackling climate change does not mean you have to sacrifice economic growth\nIt house with a relatively modest\nCarbon price and wise investment in the development of renewables managed to drive coal almost completely opposite power generation system is set itself I conservatives talk give I think of getting cold down to zero by twenty twenty five\nOr does it mean investments out front but in many places the price of renewables per unit was just being coming down far quicker even but most economists hooked on to survive and then in many parts of the world it is now cheaper\nTo gain electricity off from renewables even in places like Texas they have discovered the wind and solar is cheaper than relying on coal or gas or the other forces\nYou to assign beg lots of good news that renewables are going up but all they reliable enough and is there a place that nuclear power and all of this\nBefore we talk about nuclear I think that we need to touch we need to talk about two different things one issue is that renewables happened growing and the cost has been coming down and this is good news\nHowever they've not been driving fossil fuels off the grid and in the case of the u._k. maybe we're not using coal as much but just this week the government has given the go ahead to ... for fracking at the press to new roadside which is very close to Manchester why live the local community has been up in arms against it\nAnd the local authority trying to not allow the planting site and the central government force them to accept fracking on their locations are very anti democratic decision\nAnd three protesters were recently sentenced to jail time we do have a mixed picture and I think that we know we we need to focus our efforts not just\nOn developing renewables and driving their price down and incentivizing renewable production but we actually do need to shut down fossil fuel extraction and development and the other two separate efforts why I don't think that we can count on cheap renewables\nIt's too much to ask of cheap renewables to drive fossil fuels off the grid that's something that's a political decision that has to be taking a look at another level as already\nHas on his own we were in Norway last week where they openly admitted that they may have a great sort of hydro electricity system themselves one of the reasons they were able to do all of this was off the back of the sales of oil and increasing the gas\nWell I think as Julie saying we need action across all areas and they see the one thing I report talked about energy talks about land use talks about CDs and talks about industry\nAnd it's true that renewables by themselves cannot do everything it's of course easier to make these investments if there's a surplus however I I must say that Norway sexually ... some some um an outlier in the sense that it has been wise enough to think\nIn a long term way about all these revenues not all countries\nThat have um I'm a raw materials and other resources um have been doing it um I think um we\nNeed to you know you mentioned I'm retired at the beginning um that the summary or if our previous conversation was that this one point five feet perfectly to a well I Would like to kind of\nReal hard to do just that there's optimism that they all ...\nThere's nothing is on them but I think is really important to note that he's extremely hard that we need all the options that we need action from all sectors we need to find those community we need a policy at all levels a ... and we need um they they National Community so we really need everything and I think\nThat is an enormous challenges in it and I were going to talk about politics in the moment but if you talk about the north south divide within the world if you talk about the divisions between America and China I mean there is so many stumbling blocks to achieve what you're describing\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these tactics and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck a I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make a wartime unknown show when the twin daughters and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make all the time and that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrifying energy supply and make it a little coping as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through new those\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on Donald Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and our humanity then the problem that they have identified\nI have also tried to show you that the problem is in slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is that I Believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations\nAs well but I I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that the ... to say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nThe within the Democratic framework\nWell we're gonna have to find ways of of documenting this was that all the political system then there's no reason inherently why we can't do this using all these political system the China has a very different political structure but understand just pulled them very well because the centuries the same same issue for every country in the world\nThe risks associated with the impacts of climate change far outweigh the costs of the investment required to avoid it it's just a question of how we get the ... it is going to be difficult\nThey're all competing demands of the moment but I've I said this is really about what kind of future we want to credit for ourselves the world is moving the the global economy is changing we're going we're moving towards a population of nine billion you're not going to be able to stay in the world\nIf we don't climate better because the report was published on Monday is very clear we are moving down a path towards climate change that will mean more destruction around the world and it will lead to\nFor instance large displacements of populations around the world with the risk of conflict outside of the world of conflict is not one of prosperity and peace\n... case it would it take something like that if you look back on the news for different reasons that twenty fifty migration crisis but it does it take a joke like that than the politicians to be able to tackle list to sell the hall messages to people within a democratic system when\nI think what migration points that to us is if this great inequality then people will move and basically ... what we do in other countries will impact and other countries and that will come back to us in the form of migration\nBut I think the fundamental political problem is that people do feel left behind\nAnd they feel left behind because we're living in an increasingly unequal society\nAnd so really we can start to solve the problem with climate change as well as dealing with inequality 'cause it's the richest people who have the most ... impact whether we think about flowing reaching so much meat or driving and so on and that's also true in a global basis 'cause ... the global pool or taking more of the brunt of climate change so much less responsible for the causes of it [noise]\nLordy as another one I I just wanted to comment on the question of democracy and environment and I think one of a one of my colleagues in Cambridge professor David ... has written about how democracy is that not really well suited to attacking challenges that have not fully arrived of course we already have\nSome of these challenges with and I think ah well this is because democracies are very good benefits today costs in the future and in fact here we have a lot of costs today and kind of more feature benefits but I think we can highlight in particular policy actions that the local level that the region level at the national level\nFrom the perspective of these benefits that we will have today or in the short term and we talked about some of these health benefits there are some of the call benefits that we can talk about some of them might be health ... jobs and let me bring joy to back in ... we\nTalking about benefits in the future\nIn developed countries people didn't like having stuff taken away from them they don't want to know that they don't want to hear that they can't buy more clothes or and you call in a country like India where people are aspiring to those things are responding to the refrigerator then moved to bike and perhaps the call how honesty persuade them to say you know will you didn't want this stuff\nBasically people want to have a good life but they don't necessarily want to have throwaways things that you throw away every day so if you just take the case of plastics\nThem onto plastics me throw we consume huge amounts of muscles feels as well as energy so the question is how do we use the existing culture in different countries in the world\nTo try to focus more on quality rather than quantity so it's not as if you want to really say that you should buy less but why can't you buy better quality was very poor person it into areas that even really an option no but to put up a blessing he has the right of course to improve his life all her life\nAnd I think the question is much more about the rich the question of inequality was brought up we know that you know one percent of the was population seems to have as much as the remaining Nineteen Ninety plus and then that's also true for India do you need much more equality we didn't the Indian society as well and more sharing of the wealth\nI went to a feature view a final question all begin with you you're in ten years time if we're going to ... those are recommendations and the reports are the findings the report we would need to be well on our way to reduce ... emissions so do you believe given what we know now about a\nPossible thing on the United states global attitudes that globally we will have achieved that that we will be on our way\nSo just reports is really off for by the governments and mobile feeding to a political process at the end of year and over the coming years governments who have all these scientific evidence and sit around a table\nSo I really do hope that governments take into account the scientific evidence and put the rope on the track towards reducing global emissions Laura\nIn ten years time I think if we have countries that put in place you know the politics of the Bible second best policies to create quality shots of winners that reduce the costs to search that invest in innovation at that emphasize nickel benefits maybe [laughter]\nWell Bush I don't think we have any choice but to believe we can because the alternative is we just give up and then it's all\nDo so on one doesn't want to be overly optimistic about it more people have to engage with politicians and say to them we want to choose the future we have because in the future not just for the people here and now\nIt's a kind of well we want to leave to our children and grandchildren I think most people want the will to be a better place for their children grandchildren than they currently have\nJoined the group the court cases in India and in the U.S by young children are asking that governments there doing enough\nSo I think that when you see a whole sees all four cases where people who've tried to put pressure on the government's been need much more leadership policy entrepreneurs in social movements to get this going and we desperately need the help of the genetic\nJudy assigned Vega I Would agree\nTo that

able to maintain balance flop right and then one thing we already knew about five months that they had these specialized kind wings called how peers and how kids are basically to fly equivalent of your inner ear stimulus they use them for balance\nAnd five can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare should not fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time I did that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know how the hell chairs actually works that why information where the hell chairs provide to fly so in order to figure that\nOut what I did was to record from the healthcare hair on and I found that the timing\nOf single bike with different when I recorded the health care in a position that humiliating straight flight and versus when I recorded while the ... ... in LA\nDid apply

Oregon reflects instead they're on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel like they can and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior because it's much faster than vision to kind of like they can immediately detect rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about this finding\nImportant for us because research has shown away in that complex aspects of an animal environment can be broken down to the timing of single spike\nSo this is our brains initially represent information in the world trade single spikes anything on there I every time they

like\nWhat will it mean for for humans this information\nThan human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps to understand how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for type of research so one example would be flight technology wise it hadn't millions and years to evolve fascination mechanisms for

locations uh in in east and the odyssey and some are quite far away from from Benny so I'd in them that we have several\n... is a of of of this virus at whether I'll suspected cases that than them and\nHow effective half the prevention and control measures that have been put in place by the authorities being\nAnd it's just a tense outbreak at a boat to break into the sea\nIce since the virus was discovered hand the seventies\nIt was already are saying that that quite well protected and now they have vaccines at more than sixteen thousand people have been vaccinated or in this outbreak and that will be using experimental treatments or fifty four people have survived since the beginning of this outbreak but the real difficulty\nAt the moment is not as if you know the last time that doesn't go to the outbreak in a conflict\nArea a and said the security situation is a very tense but that\n... on the issue is not there is a lot of community mistrust as mulder significant pockets as a community of people who are resisting 'em ... who are quite skeptical that the of the virus in their response and making the ... that that was very difficult that then that\nMakes us because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly removed borders being attacked\n[noise] ... you know this is it's quite common to have community mistrust and indeed the outbreak it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to see\nPeople that are very scared but I think you know the specific is if you win this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area where there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension at in in the community uh you know just last week Asian people last month sorry eight people\nWere killed in an attack by ... group on in Danny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well\nLeslie Leslie you wrote a piece in early September about how Scotland can lead the world on\nClimate change when it it it can it get said that the political kind of initiative to do that uh the the the Scott ... reduce carbon emissions by forty nine percent roughly since Nineteen Ninety\nBut that's mostly an energy production and clean energy production and waste there's an awful lot of of difficult things that and I said the head of us if we're going to get to to the net zero emissions that all sorts of countries have have a pet targets to achieve\nUm they do you mean some very different things I mean we can't probably we have to have new breeds of cars in shape\nAt that don't have time for this delicately and met as much may say yeah and you can diet perhaps uh for for animals we need to think about becoming more vegetarian um we need to go into aviation shipping and get\nAn electric hydrogen ferries electric planes ... been piloted in Norway at the moment if you'll pardon the pun again\nAnd there's there's a big issue for countries like Scotland to Norway which have got big oil reserves and um they it they're going to have to stay in the ground not that politically is really really difficult to sell and yet the countries which make that transition first\nThey head of the curve on the proof of that is Denmark\nBecause Denmark and way back in the seventies which some of us can remember um there was an oil crisis Denmark realized it has a new nation of a ... energy supplies of his own\nAnd it decided never to to put the price of Petra back down again when actually prices to lure so it's incredibly hard an expensive to buy petrol at six incredibly expensive to buy a car in Denmark and that's what shifted fifty three percent of the population of Copenhagen onto bikes\nWhich of course there's all well and good but even if that goes on the bikes and Scotland guys on Suboxone creates new ah cows and sheep Jonah from the miserable thing is that if there are enormous countries like China and India and they don't even starting on this road\nNo as a world a global economy with with fixed on the use of of this call in and the G sauces\nOn of course it's very difficult for us to sit here and say you know China should be doing a lot more to reduce it in do you should do a lot more to reduce it we've had the glory days of using yeah pretty much all the ... hours of sunshine articles ease a massive investor and wind power and other renewable ... and ... and ... and says it is very challenging but\nWhat we haven't yet seen is that truly disruptive\nEnergy salsa or you know wind and solar and a wave energy they're all very good at

over the disappearance of Jim al ... an exiled Saudi dissident tells us that the government will have to change course to\nCreating all the enemy when setting up all the people who read a patriotic can love their country they disagree with ... printing company these tracks it's becoming very difficult\nAlso a former senior member of the populace AFDC in Germany tells us that the policy is a threat to democracy and why it can be more fun to go on holiday a loaded with us the whole first got my two guests Leslie rid of rights have little cost a columnist for the ...\nAnd Jonathan ... professor of neurology at the University of nursing I'm not here on weekends ... says the very least is well\nI Know that we'll continue denying that accusation of fascinating ... this is for sure it's going to continue and with the Saudi money they can always by people to go in at ten days confidence is at an old is doing that\nI didn't see anyone dropping they will always find a substitute for them so that's not a\nNation for ... yeah they sure he had aids that picture of that ... the former who believe in any form how they can sell that picture anymore\nIt's hiding ... opening all these from creating all these enemies aren't shutting up all the people who read a patriotic love their country but they disagree with him\nReading company these tracks it's becoming very difficult\nSo why does have an dogs so where does this end up ... points do countries stopped doing business with Saudi Arabia\n[noise] the human rights violations in there for years looking at Yemen War the hypocrisy and waste when they are\nSupporting a government that is killing ... in Yemen giving ... ate like the U.S any okay these people and these countries have to question the government's why they still do business with such country with\nSuch a regime that's being violating human rights for all these years ever since he became the ministry of defense and no one has been talking about these things\nAnd I was speaking with ... al Sharif is Saudi human rights activist who has left the country and moved to Australia fearing for her safety as I mentioned we have two guests with us\nThroughout the program Leslie ... writes a columnist up the Saltsman newspaper Brokaw so she joins us from Edinburgh on Joan assembled is with me here in London He's a professor of neurology at the University of Nottingham\nLeslie and Jonah from this they'll start with you what do you make of this um the comments today from ... until you cherish the secretary general of the United nations about ... the disappearance of this general is due to the disappearance of the moment we don't we haven't had confirmed\nAnd the thing was but what does it say about the space of respect for international news\nThis is ... ... it's a it's maybe when you listen to some stories that takes a while before some crucial details ... to\nThis this this action taken within turkey so this was where you would expect to be have the safety that the companies being a in Turkey and Saudi Arabia\nIs this like obviously within the uh the come see that this is a state within the state and and so this this disappearance or murder or killing 'em has happened within a zone within a country where you'd expect they the loss of that country to be applying\nAnd this is so brazen this disappearance at was saying that that at the wider world hasn't actually seen evidence for the Washington Post which is a pretty reputable paper at for which I'm Mr ... had had written um has said that it's hard recordings which apparently were recorded on his watch\nWhich show that he was killed 'em dismembered now I Know this is a horrible and lumped thing to be saying it does certainly in the morning but it once this sort of audio is released and it will be and I think the world will be totally shocked because it's one thing to hear of a death\nIt's another to ... the process it once not becomes released and I can see the Turks\nAnd are having to buy time because they know how powerful that material must be um ... that I think we'll have to make\nAnyone who's a progressive and support from human rights across the world have to take action to try to do something with that America and the United kingdom that have long as as your commentator said being quite hypocritical about support for this hour days\nWhat what we're told these recordings exist I I have to say we haven't heard them yet we we don't yet have proof the Saudi line is that they knew nothing about this but some\nJonas and the fact that these recordings exist actually raises another interesting question and that is if they exist or um you know there's a lot of evidence seemingly that they do want us will they go watch it suggests ... someone spying inside an embassy\nYeah well apparently from what was he just said they believe that it was a a recordings I can buy the the guy's a month so so when he entered the embassy use of the sea suspicious of what might happen I'm In the\n... and you know just to pick up on on what Leslie said and also the recall it is becoming increasingly shocking that may be that we've just had two cases like this back to back but but where rogue states seemingly can deploy killer squads into another\nThe tree in the case of um Saudi Arabia to send a hit squad apparently to to turkey or in the case of President Putin or at least people close to him to send to agents to to poison people and so it was but it does become an incredible because it doesn't seem as if the international community can then do anything about that\nQuestion quick question for both of you on this and I'm going to turn to something else and that he's the President Trump has made it very clear he doesn't like walk crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is\nSeemingly doing it but he's also very came not to in any way undermined one hundred and ten billion dollar contract the fighter jets upon which as he puts the U.S jokes to patch now is President Trump\nI joined us simply speaking playing the about the subject which perhaps other international leaders are making noises about human rights abuses but actually if there are contracts that state you know which way in the end the going to come down\nI I'm not a big fan of President Trump but he's going to school to correctly you know the the western world is a deeply involved in receiving Saudi money for her arms to various deals on the coast they don't want to jeopardize that income\n[noise] ... yes not not true um but I mean it's just curious just I mean six days ago don't jump was telling the world that Saudi Arabia wouldn't last two weeks in power to American military support and I was ... seeming to call in the country to pay more for its own defense as indeed he's been saying to\nOther members of NATO So\nYes I mean there's there's there's a law and play here but I think I'm a ... those people who are activists will have to put pressure on all those sorts of newspapers in the u._k. um US have already pulled out of the conference that was mentioned and that's not a massive thing but that that's that's a commitment by those papers to keep this issue alive\nLeslie we talked earlier about the whole issue of Scottish independence not be reading you'd be looking at ... countries and and you you think there are some lessons to be alert\n[noise] well and our our nearest neighbor's apart from at our neighbors ... within Britain are that the Nordic countries at with him we had a loss in common people like myself my family comes from the very north of Scotland and from the ... in the islands which was actually owned by Norway until sixteen hundred\nAt but not far more recent late the Nordic countries helping racing ahead and almost every league table that tedious lay of the top of everything whether it's a literacy health and wellbeing child wellbeing loan ... um equality democracy\nAnd born dates GDP they're doing extremely well they're mostly small nations around five million people same population in Scotland\nAnd surely we can look across the water and not direction across the north sea and tried to see how we could be picking up on very pure results for us in terms of health and wellbeing how could we do things better\nSo what do you think they are doing right that Scotland is doing wrong well\n[laughter] I briefly and they've got a equality in batted right to the heart of their society and they have the smallest income gaps in the world\nThey have the highest trust levels between citizens and government in the world that they've they've managed to put their resources into excellent services so that middle class people are not going off to buy private education of private health\nAnd they keep the solidarity within the system they keep people paying taxes and they pay high taxes for high quality service says\nSome of that solidarity might be beginning to crumble ... I'm a conservative governments to some of these countries and the Norwegians have such a massive the world's largest oil from because they had they that the cleverness\nTo set aside the money coming in from oil and they don't actually use it or in their everyday life but of course ... people can make the calculation that there's probably millions have grown our for each individual Norwegian if they were to claim their own\nSo I'm up until ... there's been a remarkable\nPolitical support for keeping the Nordic multiple as it's called\nUm that would have to be something Scotland would look at that of course as a devolved government we don't have the power over taxes to make the big change is necessary to achieve dot sort of redistribution of wealth that you have to have to have a a good sign of say\nOkay we will have more on this late to lead the we're we're going to go out to Alastair Ross who has the sports news\n[noise] if I were gonna start with the world anti Doping Agency who have been the dying claims that it signaled the views of athletes when I chose to lift the ban on the Russia investigation say last month is author of BBC interview\nAnd waste leading athletes representative on the committee said she'd been bullied by some of the organizations by senior officials to try and drop her opposition to the ... this accusation\nThe head of the world bank Jim Kim has withdrawn from the meeting\nThe U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo has coat on and courage to quickly three other Americans in prison in ... after the release on friday of the evangelical pasta Andrew Brunson he\nWill meet President Trump later today to form a\nMalaysian deputy prime minister and opposition leader on by Abraham is I think the first day of his return to political life Mr ... who is part and earlier this year after being jailed for ... twenty Fifteen he's running in a parliamentary election today\nOfficials in the polls say at least eight climbers missing on the ... snowstorm strong that kind of a police spokesman said finally South Koreans and therefore Nepalese guide a presumed\nTo have died\nSearch and rescue teams in the usa to Florida had to work in Mexico beach the town the hardest hit by hurricane Michael the stone devastated communities across the region\nHundreds of people around accounted for the\nRepublican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania and Scott Wagner has taken down a video from social media in which he threatened his Democratic opponent ... move in the video game is a Wagner threatened to stone pulled over his opponents face\nWe'd go spikes BBC News [noise]\nYou're listening to weekend from the b._b._c.

I always have that you can do in your marriage or your bedroom or your kitchen\n... what what really came to my attention last year was\nA story about a guy who was self medicating self treating is HIV infection so he was essentially injecting himself with some DNA in the hope is producing an antibody that would then kill him or at least control his his infection and that's what this is this this is crazy um you know it is this really happening\nAnd so we started to look around read around and and we saw all those definitely a a a radio series in in here\nI yeah I I've got a few questions soft that how warm us cannot be possible\nIt's incredible what you can do to yourself self experimentation is totally acceptable and of course the the thing is we've had great strides in the area of genetic engineering so muggy find your own genome for example um what do you find that the genetic material of of life in general\nAnd so all of these things have become more accessible that very cheap so it means that in essence you can do pretty complicated experiments in your marriage or in your bedroom and there are people trying to put their own muscles to make themselves they get this is a technique that's been proven to work in animals\nAnd so you you've got this whole meal bombed the people who were trying to do these experiments an advance science outside the confines of the ...\nThis is all well and good but it isn't it potentially incredibly dangerous\nPotentially dangerous to to the people who do it to them on the whole generally find out the what's needed that than knowledgeable people like they know the risks but it's still doing things outside of the convention of no more regulation and so that has to be a risk\nAnd you're doing this these people are doing this a highly let me just give me an idea of the kinds of conditions you mentioned mentioned muscles that but what what could you do to yourself\nWell anything that we could do in a lab in theory you could now too in in a in a a ... a well equipped\nA carriage will basement to Ohio so things like changing your muscle was was was the famous one but it's the chap who tried securities hey try to control these I tried the with the production of an antibody using a piece of DNA the next experiments who's guns changes to remove these cells from his body\nManipulate those cells genetic and he said that they lack the protein that the virus needs to get into the cell and then ... them back into his body and again in the hope of controlling insects and so they can do very complicated things\nWhich we do and we see in clinical trials around the world but that because they're doing it on themselves they don't have all the rigmarole of guns from ethical approval and another\nThing I'll hit the last ... yeah a scientist so you actually sort of secretly quite pleased when people do this because that doing experiments that that would take you years\nI wouldn't say will please because obviously one of the reasons that we have these regulations in place is to protect people because there are risks and you assess risk but it does raise the ... the discussion about whether or not regulation\nHas become incredibly inhibit tree so progress things to to use in humans so for example\nIf I were at the at the outset to the program some of the vaccines and not being used in in the boat and they have to be fast track through the regulation so that we could use them and I think it is this whole thing about housing now go to the point where it's hindering progress\n[noise] bio hacking you heard it here first and you have is that you made a whole radio series about this which you can find on the BBC website Leslie ... tell me about capping hops\nIt's as if to jump in stories that animal yes it is it's grace and well and and again looking at the ... across the world that she late and we did latitudes and lots of people have mental wouldn't ... to the weekend\nIt's most common actually in Norway they have the highest rates of thought in the world that you can tell\nThat there is about one hot for every seven Norwegian so that's really one for family and but it's dry stretches right across the the northern hemisphere Canada America all the Nordic said the Russians the checks the Germans\nAnd then down in the southern hemisphere that the New Zealand has a famous for their batches\nCountry one country is that what is latitude that doesn't have this tradition is Scott and so I've been doing a PHD for eight years at comparing Norway and Scotland's hot traditions partly because I was eccentric enough to have a ... in Scotland myself with no electricity no running water\nAt way out in the top of the hell's wasn't everybody's ... I loved it and I think actually far more people would get genuine relaxation um if they could get away from physically get away from absolutely everything and not be seeking the chemical release of alcohol which is usually how people escape and\nI'm guessing the reason there's a different tradition in Scotland is land rights\nAnd says and it's just so difficult to get a little bit of land\nAnd there's four hundred and thirty two ... and ... people who own half the private ... I think well I don't know we saw a lot to south electoral that's that's very very small Norway has tens of thousands perhaps even hundreds of thousands of landowners\nAnd so you can easily at by a piece of land from the farmer [noise]\nOkay um one day I'm going to go to Scotland cycle around 'em stay in both as we will talk about another time because we now have to jump to another story not stay selections which take place in Bavaria\nIn Germany tomorrow this has been a stronghold for the conservative Christian social union but opinion polls suggest that the right wing populists ... after they\nCould do very well if the CS use hold on a very it is we ... that could put some pressure on its ally Chancellor Angela Merkel has been facing increasing pressure from the populist rise\nFor allowing close to a million refugees\nInto Germany in twenty Fifteen some opinion polls even suggest that the AFC is now the second most popular party across Germany from this got Schreiber was a leading member of the FDA on cheap now believes the party is a threat to Jim and democracy in must be stopped she's written a book\nCalled inside AFDC about why she changed her mind about a former policy earlier this week\nShe told me about what first attracted to the ...\nThat was quite a good feeling it was quite an interesting crude of persons at wasn't open on ... so I had a ... a good feeling at the beginning the parking lot in the ... I'm healthy way and it was very\nDangerous how'd a parking is such at it now and now they are a pretty ... pretty anti immigration\nBut you're saying it was actually different at the beginning really\n[noise] yes it was it's a big difference though there are some persons at the beginning to was told a nationalistic staff but they were just a little of men minority now day I read that the night charity and they asked to absolutely power in ...\nFeelings about nature I still run high in the ... almost Twenty years off to the bombing campaign which severely damaged the capital Belgrade strikes successfully full ... presidents sober down most of itch to withdraw troops from Kosovo and allow international peacekeepers in\nBut this week Serbia is hosting an exercise organized by nature ... disaster response coordination center and the country's president like sound that through church says it's time for a more rational approach towards the alliance ... correspondents gods and they spoke\nTo him and to NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg\nThey're not getting her leg it has anything made the as\nYou know that in on the other hand they do not see that there were\nA lot of people like to describe Serbia it's a traditional ally of Russia well that'd be surprised by the scenes here unless ... about an hour outside battled right\nBehind me there are rows and rows of disaster relief personnel from all over the world I can see Bosnia Croatia\nFinland Greece Italy Hungary Pakistan is a stage that tough with the flag of NATO and the twenty nine member states of the alliance and the low guy that the flags of Serbia and they ... and the slogan Soviet twenty Eighteen disaster response exercise\n\nIts right to say that the NATO I'm doesn't often got them airing in Serbia the country's president Alex on the ... church if he wants to change people's perceptions of the alliance and the Russian level\nYou ever heard of friends with our corporation and I think it's all about emotional issues\nMainly because of nine to nine and because of course we sure this is something that we need to work on the ... do improve our corporation and that's what you're going to do in the future of those things that are after a while we'll have to put things more on the Russian will ...\n\nBoth sides sort of pains to emphasize the non military nature of the exercise NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg insists that he respects is longstanding policy of military neutrality\nBut there's been much turbulence in the western Balkans recently from allegations of Russian interference in Macedonia haven't bumped negative to the election of a subset protest to the presidency of Bosnia\nMr Stoltenberg says that means that makes sense for NATO to strengthen its cooperation with Serbia\nThe partnership with sugar has become more important\nIs the fact that we have seen some tendons is towards your turn to the vet is Joan nationalistic rhetoric\nOf the ... and we have two boys that you know to avoid going back into will do so on and then I Do not this we'd wars killing civilians suffering on really really a dangerous or the situation in those so what's the ... I'm sure you're seeing the\nGraffiti on the rules about right when it being had is still very strong feelings\nAgainst nighttime what what can you do to to help change those feelings do thing I think we need to\nRecognize that this is a different part of our history ... to forget the bucket but who should not be whole back by history we should be able to look into the future on on the roof together and that's exactly what we're doing [noise]\nTake a walk around belt right out of the the the the people there and find it hard to change their views of NATO I'm standing in front of a mural\nWhich to pick a belt to end the flaming Belgrade skyline underneath the slogan Serbian never in nature\nAround eight and ten Seventy and say that are opposed to joining the alliance and it's difficult to see that shifting you should joke ... ... is the ... the illusion of the European Union and director of Belgrade Institute of European studies\nAlso do does in may ...\nContinue to lead general regional politics here again\nVery much based on the double spending since all The Waltons goals for Gulf War can never go for Republicans ... ... people are coming to the logical ... really doing ... managing there would be broom their perception Bulger laugh but\nOthers say it's hosting of NATO's disaster response exercise as evidence that Serbia and particularly president victory which is leading increasingly towards the west yelling the ... is the director of Belgrade Center for Europe ... studies\nWe can all actually gain a lot potentially\nCounty close to ... for the time being really fit in Utah but the process of elimination that can continue to do in position of democratic corporate ... odd to me that she thinks that all of us but to me personally that was the acting the key\nAvenue of the Russian influence in the region and taking them\nThat played a firm desperately [noise]\nCalls the disaster response exercise could also be taken at face value rather than a sign of any shift in the legion says the but the twentieth anniversary of the NATO bombing approaching it does seem that relevant recriminations reconciliation maybe in the\n... list in that package guys are looney our\nBalkans correspondent still with me Jonah symbol\nOf the University of Nottingham and Leslie with us from ... Leslie that really shows just how deep rooted alliances and international relations can change pushy quickly on the table states\nThese days well that's when you look at ... that's been interesting things happening for it actually for the last refiled because certainly applying for ... and ... it's been bras ten was ... it was brought in and twenty fourteen as as a ... state I'm part of the reason that happened\nIs because Serbia ... got very long standing and the ... still doesn't recognize Kosovo's independence\nBut both sides how how's it going to be present to make things together and you take connection praised the political courage in maturity tackling the ... together\nAnd so there's been the beginnings already of recognizing that to get bigger ... achievements and and ... and social good sphere ... which would you membership would probably bring\nUnique to bury an awful long civil damage tastes so they've already seen on the route to the side would say for a bike can last six or seven years\nYeah Jonathan talking of EU membership I mean Fifteen Years ago who to fill that would've been leaving the European Union\n[noise] it's uh [noise] certainly came as a big shock to me and I I think many many colleagues in academia\nWe were simply went ... expecting it I'm ... and of course we we really don't have any clue what's going to happen in the future when when no near and understanding or idea of what breaks it will mean for any office and I think that's the biggest worry is that we ended up in this kind of nowhere\nPosition and these relationships just changed so fast I suppose that means they could change back again\nThey could do I I guess you know there are lots of people hoping that this thing may never happen but it goes off to the u._k. population\nExcept in Scotland I understand Leslie's point did vote for something I don't think they were really sold a true picture and that's the problem ... this is we can from the BBC [noise]\nThe K U T public media studios you're listening to Katie in key U.

I can uh mayor is a former member of the Turkish Parliament for the opposition C. H. P. policy he's now a senior fellow at the same time the foundation for the defense of democracies\nIn Washington DC he told us\nThat the Turkish government could no longer bear the pressure of us try sanctions\nClearly there was a major change of heart's in Turkey for witnesses who had earlier testified against pastor Brunson\nRetracted their testimonies prosecution which has a very harsh again a run for this time around in that that the lifting off his house at us as well as lifting up his travel ban and the judges issued surgically they need to\nSentence you know three years one month thing day which allowed pastor Brunson not to go back to prison but walk free and I think here we have on the part of the Turkish government voice is ... ongoing crisis in the United states\n[noise] Monsanto and our correspondent in Istanbul still on the line mark his I Can't ... writes the U.S sanctions essentially could no longer be borne by the government to non corrupt\n[noise] yeah I think that's what was behind this I mean president had one has always insisted that turkey has a an impeccably impartial\nI'm an independent judiciary a and that he missed Adam would not be able to interfere in the case of pasta Bronson despite us pressure uh bought that is ridiculed y techie watch as he points to the fact that for example the world Economic Forum place ranks techie a hundred and ... of a hundred and thirty seven countries\nIn terms of the independence of the judiciary I'm I'm just to add one himself has previously raised the idea of a prisoner swap between pasta Brunson and\nFed to like you land who is the ... cleric who's been living in the U.S since Nineteen Ninety nine and who techie blames the failed coup a couple of years ago\nUm so I think clearly this was a political a decision on day at a deal of some sorts struck between ... and Washington and all that economic pressure that the White House placed on techie sanctions on package ministers tariffs on ...\nI'm In the midst of an economic was gathering storm if not a crisis here tequila literally could not afford to keep us the Brunson in prison anymore um he was the key to relieving some most of the some of the tension and not to attack us relationship\nYes pasta from somebody had been freed because he wasn't the only US citizen in detention in to ... and the likelihood of The Elders being released\nWell interestingly and Mike Pompeo the U.S secretary of state has just tweet to reduce tweet and this was last night he said\nPasta Brunson is finally coming home to America flooding alone will deal for the pasta and his family we hope that the Turkish government will quickly release our other the other detained us citizens and State Department locally employee to solve\nThis is three people who he's talking about one is a ... us joy as citizen a he's a NASA scientist\nWho's been imprisoned half a supporting and actually supporting terrorism and then um to tux who work for a un American diplomatic missions\nSo you know they're all still looks hug was had an attack us relationship there were these three are there are other issues involving the fact that for example us tax cuts in Syria which techie says there's a a terrorist group is Kurdish militants that\nSo you know there are plenty of bumps along the road bought the Bronx and if she was one of the major sources of friction\nMark I'm going to ask you one more question and then I'm going to bring in John ... and Leslie how is the Turkish media portraying these developments any suggestion that this isn't a balancing climbed down for president while\nThe new the text media was Ninety percent I'm In ... a controlled by a or a well controlled by the government controlled by very close allies of the government so\nUh yesterday evening when ... was was released the text presidency released a statement saying this shows\nHow this was an independent decision by the ... and of course that is exactly how\nThe Ninety percent of the media have which is basically the mouthpiece of the government has ... has reported it a big focus of smiling president had one saying this was a you know techie standing up for its judicial independence and ... and you know and and resisting us pressure\nAnd the two or three newspapers that still have a a relatively independent voice hey we'll ... but I mean they have such a small a readership now and they have been pushed opposite to the ... when he talked about media coverage hey you're basically talking about government a government mouthpiece voices\nJonathan bull I'm Leslie with us or with me to join us Leslie took\nTo mock well when I was wondering about that because it drank bells with me mark with say the situation earlier this summer where\nNorth Korea released prisoners I'm under pressure again from obviously from President Trump ... it's not just a question of what you know the Turks are feeling obliged to do it that President Trump makes a very big deal of getting our guys home from regimes all over the world\nYeah he does like me and I think that this is clearly a win for him um for weeks before the midterm elections he tweeted yesterday of course about uh you know how he was delighted that pasta Brunson was\nComing home and that he would be welcomed in the oval office today at the American pasta lions at about mid day um eastern\nTime so I I he will be in the in the White House I Would have thought on this afternoon so I you know the same happened with those returns imprisoned is North Korea and these are all kinds of personal missions by\nA by Donald Trump and he said kind of reap the benefits of it and also it was ... ... plus the Bronx and it plays very well into the uh evangelical support base bugs of Donald Trump fond of Mike Pence the vice president\nReally went south I'm limburg sounding very very um loud loudly\n... that the pasta issue um and this you know this place very very well into the support base and all of those evangelical Christians who will you know who who they need to go out and vote in those congressional elections\nJonathan yeah no I was just wondering whether or not it is seen in the U.S as another example of a Donald gets things done\nYeah I mean you've got that I've seen tweets are of you know the Trump supporters saying promises made promises kept and you know to keep America great great everything so so so I think this is you know it was clearly um I I kind of fairly embarrassing\nDiplomatic showdown between tech in the U.S\nOr you know these to these uh to NATO allies that would basically happiness each other's throats and you know sanctions and tariffs between tech in the usa for the last few months the plummeting of the Turkish currency I mean all of that um to to pass another us administration would be something that they would welcome very delicately\nBut today the White House administration they have been you know proud of of basically tightening the screws on the on the tax um and then I liked it that pasta Bronson a has come home I should just point out that\nI'm Andrew Brunson has been released Dennis ... who was a gentleman who was a German former correspondent for the German newspaper ... was released a after a long time in imprisonment head off the German political pressure\nUh but these are too high probably thought profile names who got too powerful states behind them tens of thousands of others here who claimed wrongful imprisonment have not got a big important strong foreign power behind them and they are still languishing in prison as they say that they are victims of techies politicized judiciary\nMock Q A earning your money this weekend the BBC's ... in Istanbul\nAs soon as we can from the b._b._c.

choose to write that an Arabic on that jacket [noise]\nIt was in the light of the Muslim ban\nSo the Muslim ban is how it's known but this is of course the travel ban that was introduced by President Trump there's been many versions of that but the latest that we have is a list of countries including Iran Libya Somalia Syria\nAnd Yemen correct and although I Am not part of these countries that come from Lebanon myself my immigration attorney phoned me when does ban went out and said don't leave the country\nBecause even though you have a green card you may not be able to get back because of all the uncertainties that were going on at this time how did you feel about that when I felt trapped to be honest the country Lebanon wasn't part of the list Syria was\nAnd there's so much prejudice about where we come from the United states I wanted to use the Arabic language as it's one of the most beautiful language that Kelly griffey the words demeaning I wanted to use it for good and I wanted to use it with an American message to shows that\nThere's nothing bad about where we come from are who we are\nThese countries are the ones that are on the list the arguments before the ban is that they are deemed to have significant terrorists presence and it's interesting that your personal reaction to it I mean you say you you you felt trapped but you chose to react to that through fashion not just in the jacket but also in in a headscarf telling me about that\n[noise] yes so the ... is an image of the middle east North Africa at night as seen from NASA from space so it's a global image it's a\nDark blue with little lights you know little the yellow lights representing the life that we see from space and the CDs\nAnd there's a were banned crust out across the scarf this

power in order for us to express ourselves at least\nYou've crossed borders as a refugee yourself when you were young with your family from living on to Canada and now you're in New York and I'm just wondering how your experience\nCrossing borders translated into your fashion I left Lebanon at four and a half years old and the first landed in the United states on a refugee status and Canada accepted as refugees so we traveled to Canada\nAnd returned to let the non for six formative years of my life [laughter] watching Lebanon rebuilt after the wire was significant for me as a human as a woman as an artist and it has inspired me to use my voice to represent where I come from\nAnd I felt that I was just accidental ambassador of Mike on culture where I constantly had to explain we're not terrorists were not dangerous\nWe're not living in tents we're not traveling on camels and all of the prejudice that I was faced with and you've designed something called the dignity Iraq yeah tell me about that\nSo the dignity key is molded out of the key of my own home having traveled everywhere and feeling a little bit like and known that myself and I was inspired by the Palestinian tradition of wearing your key around your neck\nThey came to Lebanon in the millions and they left their homes behind and I wanted to be used that symbol to empower refugees and to change the

C. O. two from the atmosphere\nOne headline from oil company ... read for a station that point the report was into the territory of agriculture the business of feeding the seven billion and rising mouse on our planet itself a major source of greenhouse gases\nSo appropriate a second report appeared in makeshift just shortly afterwards headlined options for keeping the food system within environmental limit\nExamining not just the climate but all the ecological impacts of farming needles ... spring when came into the studio told me the point was the seat where sustainability meets food security\nEnvironment in health related to the fundamental pillows that determine welfare broadly defined so we started from the point that we have to be able to feed a growing population in the future a healthy diets\nWithout wrecking the environment so therefore we look at both healthy dietary patterns and ways to limit the environmental impacts of the food system\nAnd you then break the impact status of five cats of grace I think the principle of which is the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide was on but there's a whole range of aspects that you're looking at\nYeah what we know is that the food system really has tremendous impact on the environment on the range of different issues you named greenhouse gas emissions but it also occupies about forty percent of the earth land surface it extracts Seventy percent of global fresh water resources\nAnd over application of ... have already led to dead zones in oceans where you don't have oxygen anymore and fish died\nSo he goes fertilizers or things like large traits which are manufactured in big factories and then put from fields\nEver looked at nitrogen and phosphorus application those are the two big chemicals that are also responsible for a classic pollution when they run off the field\nBecause then comes to the second step in your analysis this idea of a pilot tree boundary [noise] they seem to fade as it comes to me\nYeah they're a little bit banks so they're intended to describe a safe operating space for humanity so if we don't see them then we're sort of find we had conditions that we know we can operate with\nAnd the idea is if you're a seat them then you run the risk that something goes have except to say so it gives you an example for climate change it would be if\nWe pass a certain limited for example one point five degree warming to degree warming then we have a higher occurrence of extreme weather events drought flooding and song\nFor phosphorus and nitrogen we might have excessive pollution of water systems with more occurrences of those dead zones and also with the other ones I mean you would interfere with ecosystems speed farmers or to global hedge logical cycle\nIn your house this applies to now I'm twenty fifty it was sort of a simple question aren't we already are pricing beyond the Planetree boundaries that said\nYes we have we know that we have already emitted quite a lot of greenhouse gas emissions so the climate change boundaries really at risk of being crossed and we also know re ah in several regions applying to much fertilizers so those two things already into dangerous soon to say\nThat to go back to the feet security if we're already over ... marks are you looking at some areas by which we couldn't go on feeding a bigger population while reducing those impacts\nYeah absolutely or at least not increasing them right I mean for fertilizer application we need to reduce for greenhouse gas emissions we need to reduce but there are several things at our disposal booth which we can do that I mean we know that some regions really over fertilize they don't need to fertilize that much to crops will grow with a bit less fertilizer is well\nSame with a bit less water use so a big part of this whole scenario exercise is really\nWhat needs to be done globally and in different regions so if we were to let's say ... the educational fertilizers from over ... regions to end up buying regions then we wouldn't have a net increase but more food available for people\nI mean it sounds hopeful but on the other hand if people are applying to much fertilizer even now suggests that you're dealing with people who are making very good decisions\nThe thing is they don't have good tools at their disposal either so we know if you really properly monitor how much you apply to fields and if you know how much your crops need then you can really be a balance that much better and some countries mostly in high income countries have those technologies and they don't over fertilize to that degree\nSo it's really a question of how can you make available those best available management practices to a growing number of regions predominantly low income regions\nThat some of the production and the other one which we often talking about here on the world surveys is about the ... the change of diet this I think the important pressure it all of this as the will become stricter\nYeah exactly we know that once people have more money they usually spend it on so called higher value foods and among those are meat products but also fruits and vegetables the closest foods and we know that isn't very good for your health nor is it very good for the environment because many animal\nSource foods have a high impact on the environment just because they're so inefficient converters of feet into calories that we eat\nYourself to Mexico I was expecting you to come in and sort of be mean gloomy and you seem to see a lot of hope it will face another ... to this is as a huge amounts of starvation even now even with this inefficient system\nYeah that's right we know though that we could already know feeds the current population much more healthy leave without all that stuff ... so a problem as really inequality in the food system so high income countries consume too much lower income countries consume too little and almost everybody consumes the wrong stuff\nSo if we were there to visit gay realign the food system and really clearly communicate what is a healthy diet then I think we would be in a better place\nAnd they see as the weeks the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change has come out with a special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably if she didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed\nReally we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were to happen then for example if we could expect reduction in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them on healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the other patient measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nLast spring than from the ... the Martian program on the future of food [laughter]\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against

do we decided it's kind of a gray area ... almost even open access advocates you know people who\nAdvocate for or science being freely available online even they will admit to an extent that was ...

fall in love with your name or your birthday country wants to fall in love with your own ideas your own work of course you can research has called this the ikea\nIn fact you mentioned that you built the table this is Julian university marketing professor Daniel mulch on maybe came out a little bit crooked probably your wife or your neighbor would see it for what it is you know probably a shoddy piece of work from the ship\nA shoddy piece of work and ship because some of us are not necessarily talented at building our own furniture in fact if you go online you can find plenty of videos of people struggling to put together that ikea coffee table dresser\nI don't really understand when they're part is I don't feel like we have the seed we thought we did\nBut even though building the furniture can be a painful chore people seem to really like the outcome\nTo you that cable might seem really great because you're the one who created it it is the fruit of your labor in that is really the idea behind the IKEA effect is\nIf we come to over value the things that we have created ourselves\nIn fact the psychological bias might actually be an important part of a key as business model\nAnd what you think about a year is that I Can't give you good furniture for a low cost because they afloat lots of the costs onto their consumers the assembly costs\nBut in fact we were in if this challenging that idea in St Louis is actually a psychological benefit behind this that actually people might end up liking to furniture more because they built it if it's not so much it costs for the benefit that they get to build their own furniture\nDaniels in his coauthors did a series of experiments to test this hypothesis they brought on as years into the lab and gave them either a lego car pre assembled or give them that goes and instructions and tool the participants to build a car themselves then they asked the volunteers how much what you pay to keep you on like a\nCar and what we find is that the people who build their own leg was\nNot only are willing to pay more to keep their assembled leg goes but also when we asked him how proud of their of their own creation they tend to be prouder of their legs in mind you these are lego that are designed to five to seven year olds but nonetheless it seems to be some competent some some pride associated with words creation even for basic things as building legos\nThe receptors replicated the study using other products like ikea furniture and the effect was the same\nPeople who spent time and effort building something felt proud of what they'd built sand luck with it and waiting to pay lots of money to keep the things they'd built from the perspective of irrational economist this doesn't make much sense\nJust students might be willing to pay twice as much money to buy the exact same lego car if they just finished building lego car then if the legal car was given to them rebuild\nSo why make people value something more after building it themselves compared to bind the same product made by someone else for half the cost our hypothesis\nWas that people tend to use products to signal valued identities do both themselves and to others and we know the identity of people really care about is showing that you're competence is sort of one of the basic human motivation and so we had positive sides of people use self\nMade products as a way to signal competence both themselves and to ... you know having just build the table or having just built to plug in that book case has completed products\nI'm actually in a sense of a badge of my own personal competition I completed it different I Know I'm a competent person and more I can just play this product as signal that identity is competent identity to others\nAnd so we hypothesized that it was the dealings of competence associated with the products that led to their increasing probably reach out\nTo test the theory that people's feelings of competence was behind the IKEA effect the research has had some participants think about other qualities they might value on themselves besides competence things like honesty more intelligent humor basically the idea was if we make it less important for people to demonstrate competence\nDo they still over value their own creations [noise]\nSo we found that the acute effect disappeared when ... when we did jak manipulation so once competence wasn't that important to people\nPeople are our participants no longer seemed to get much rather than of creating your own product against Jesse and that that the reason why we tend to like her creations is because we use them as a way to see no competence both to ourselves and to other\nHears the flipside of that coin you can make the IKEA effect stronger like getting people to question that competence in one experiment Daniel and his colleagues gave participants math problems\nTo saw before asking them to build an ikea project if\nThe problems with difficult lots of people fail to solve that now volunteers became much more likely to want to demonstrate that competence to the ikea building project\nThat participants who at least temporarily\nHad their sense of competence threat and who got the very difficult math questions\nTends to be more willing to build their own products so when we when we surveyed ... where do you prefer to have and like your product that comes to rebuild or the exact same product that comes on bills and you build it yourself\nThose who had got difficult math problems and we're feeling someone incompetent at the time seem more willing they were much more likely to want to build a product themselves and therefore innocence restore their sense of competence through this activity\nLet me give me the numbers chairman was this a big effect which is a small effect I mean what happens when people feel bad compared to when they don't feel that\n[noise] so so what we found is that about a third of the people want us to build the ikea bookshelf in the control condition when they weren't made to feel bad and just never went up to about sixty percent when they were made to feel bad so so significantly larger number of people want us to do this\nThe IKEA effect and implicit eco tourism might seem at first blush to be interesting and amusing but not terribly significant\nBut the more I thought about this the more I saw the potential applications just as we can be drawn to those who have the same birthday as fast or the same name as us we might also be more inclined to help people who look like us or sound like us or live near us\nThat's your congressperson who's drafted a particular piece of legislation your commitment to that bill might out way it's important to the public\nWell let's say you're a president who starts a war on the yards of investing your time and effort to prosecute that who are you may find it difficult to accept the evidence that you made a

wearing this apple smart watch when he went in and that it might have been that recording\nThat it might have been recording and then immediately a loading that data to the cloud or to his iPhone which was being held by his fiance I teach a Chinese who is just a couple of hundred meters away waiting for him\nAnd what sense do you get as you know how much trouble I took his give them an want to cause for Saudi Arabia\nI think that turkey and Saudi have very bad relations right now maybe the lowest in their history they find themselves on the opposite sides of several major regional issues\nIncluding Iran or Qatar the Muslim Brotherhood and these are the big issues that overlay much of the region um they you know aren't even so much in agreement on Syria anymore once they were in alliance a ... on the Syria issue but right now turkey is working with Russia and Iran in terms of\nCreating a settlement and Saudi I don't even know what it's doing with regard to Syria anymore so I I think that there's big issues there but on the other hand I don't think that you know ... wants to create a huge\nDiplomatic crisis with Saudi Arabia or with the Gulf but I think that they're slowly coming to the conclusion that Turks that they don't really control this this is a bigger than they are\nAnd that there's several major political constituencies in Turkey there's Islam is who are the kind of base of a retro type or to one's a justice and Development Party\nThere or the national is hard line nationalists who are a somewhat aligned with her to want on certain issues\nAnd there is the opposition liberals center left et cetera and all three of those major constituencies want answers the local media is going crazy on this issue is the top story and every single newspaper on every television broadcast\nIf you go to the Saudi constantly where this incident apparently took place um you'll see cameras camped out twenty four hours in front of the consulate and they're all the Turkish a station as well as like CNN and international channels\nAnd we do have this agreement for joined investigation between the ticks and the Saudis me more hope though that that will be transparent\nI think that I Would have very little hope that the investigation itself and its public pronouncements would be transparent but given the nature of both governments and and just the nature of how these things sort of workout but\nThere's you know the sort of culture of leaks in Turkey and other countries and so you know things just can't be hidden that much it's just not that easy to hide this kind of stuff ah especially when there's so much public interest so much demand for answers\nAnd that was both the dark guy he generally for the independent newspaper in stumble\nSo President Trump spoke of severe punishment if it was proved\nThat mystical shrugged jeep was murdered by the Saudis but well foam might not take in golden book is the middle east expert at the Washington think tank the center for a new American security there's also a former State Department official under President Obama\nLast thing nobody really knows what form it might take the reality is that there has been no real consequences for Saudi Arabia for\nA series of problematic actions over the past few years even just the past couple of years I mean that the war in Yemen they launched a blockade cuts are with no real plan for what they were going to do afterwards\nThey picked a fight with Canada over Canada just routine commentary on Saturday human rights record and I've also done things like crack down on their own\nLeadership and put hundreds of people on the rich Carlton next door to billions of dollars and then with no real consequences so it's just quite sure what kind of consequences can you actually bring to bear I think in many ways the most severe consequences come not from the U.S down from the from the fact that companies and\nIndividuals and institutions start to back away from Saudi Arabia might be the most profound come a response and just the honestly I think they are already feeling some consequences in the form of\nInternational embarrassment or that they are probably getting right now and are questioning why did we actually did\nYou say that have been no consequences from the Trump Administration but I mean you could say that about a whole list of us administrations including the one you have done the president to bomb I mean a whole list of administrations have basically turned a blind eye toward Saudi Arabia me\nNow that's a legitimate critique and I think that's absolutely true us out of your relationship is a long time drawing based on you know the U.S provide security Saudi Arabia provides loyal and that's how we've worked there for a long time I do think the Trump Administration is a little different in that\nAnd the president seemed at such a personal affinity for Saudi Arabia no previous administration no previous president would have gone to Saudi\nArabia is the first country that went to you know previous administration did criticize human rights violations in Houston it might lead to some consequences but don't eat some laying the Saudis that you can do whatever you want and I think the message from the Trump administration's\nAnd Jared cushion earned a strong relationship between Mohammed than someone and Jared Kushner the president's own full over them and early visit it's really been you can do anything you can literally do anything so no wonder Saudi miscalculated here\nIs a difference between looking the other way and almost actively promoting and giving green light to a problematic be\nBut I mean the arms deals that President Trump claimed credit for all I think a hundred and ten billion dollars with the bombs deal I mean many of those deals are actually negotiated under President Obama winning\nThey work and it's not like I said in the Obama administration also chose not to argue with the Saudis over Yemen or which I think in retrospect it was a mistake because they had just signed the Iran nuclear agreement and they wanted to essentially not another fight with the Saudis while the pushing their priority on Iran so they went along with\nSome of the problematic Saturday\nOfficials in the money I say at least ten people have been killed and more than twenty injured in a
