the bottom of every issue but it's certainly enough time from the FBI's you complete the task that they've been given initially from the president as I understand that the task was to interview\nFor all of the individuals whose names were brought up during the hearings professor for mark judge in Mr Smith than there was the fourth name that I don't recall\nAll of whom can either corroborate doctor for Oregon corroborate\nA judge Kavanaugh's versions of events that's a very small task actually very simple to locate an interview those people regarding the allegation\nMark judge of course this is the friends of Brett Kavanaugh others are accused of being present when some of the alleged issues took place he said that either he doesn't recall ... at the problems that some of the statements on the accusations simply wasn't true\nWhat Ken FBI agent sitting in front of him do differently to to to find out if he is saying holds water will not\nWell one thing that happens when the FBI come up to interview you is that there is an admonition usually the mood gr the false statements to the FBI is separate crime from anything else that they might be investigating so there is usually a a\nGood reason for a person tell the truth but the second thing is the FBI investigators there'll be sending out our experience ... investigators they're independent of politics and the process\nThey want to provide a balance look at the allegations and they're skilled at getting people to confide in them where they might not complied with the press the media or or partisan politician so the hope is that they will ah open up to the FBI and perhaps\nTheir memory will be\nWill be stimulated by the uh the occasion they'll provide additional information that may lead other other places\nAnd is it your under on understanding the FBI would that have the authorization to do those subsequent interviews required\nWell that's a that's a question that's kind of up in the air the president seemed to indicate that they could follow the lead to where they wanted to go but there may be some conflict with the office of legal counsel which works for the president this is all going to depend on what the director ... director Christopher Wray else's age and if you want them to do\nI truly believe that there will be able to follow a logical leads what the president will probably not allow them to do is to go out into other\nAllegations that are not related to the one made it made by a doctor for\nAny of the other people that are are authorized for interview this was still in negotiations with the with the Senate so we'll\nHave to see how it plays out in the next seven days\nOnce they do complete the investigations within the scope of whatever is allowed to them within the scope of the time will happen next to do they give a recommendation did they say yes this person is St for example to be a judge on on the Supreme Court\nNo and background investigations the FBI never provides a recommendations or conclusions the agents in the field who are conducting these interviews will will not actually have any input into summaries that are provided to the White House in the report in the investigation they\nWill simply complete their their interviews send them electronically to FBI Headquarters where they will be ... and placed into a reporter and there will be an executive summary of the contents of the interviews at the beginning and that will be provided to the White House\nAren't computer room too big for people trapped in wrecked buildings in palm

really listen to music comes for the food doesn't music because I'm such a distraction for me pop music\nIs really hard for me to hear in restaurants or on the on the subway in cars are in grocery

when music playing the kind of takes foreground and conversations lag or other thoughts that should be there to take the ... so I don't really listen to music that much that said I've just come from a long vacation\nAnd visited a friend so if you call it was a great artist in her home in the south of France and walked in and she was playing the same music to my boyfriend and I have been putting in our\nNew York apartment for the past year I guess kind of as background knows from a more attractive to convey ambient or non pop who known vocal music because I Am able to have a plane and do other things to talk of music is just horrible for me to through Lincoln over my\nOr\nMichael ... such an interesting mountain and fascinating to hear him say that a pop music is just horrible\nTo him [laughter] say only the jurors names only has the huge don't reach contemporary novels or watch TV which is just ... to somebody like Michael ... not listening to pop music\nUm I think there's some similarities with with him it sounds also bit like music\nIs what he may so we see when he hears that he's hearing all the workings and they make this choice and he's not able to detach from it I have a bit of that perhaps when I watch TV or film having made it are like oh this is where they put the camera okay they probably have to cut here because some things have gone wrong\nUm I I don't read too much contemporary literature I think in part because\nI I Would like to learn from these writers in the past and maybe I Need writers to be on a pedestal and if their contemporaries somehow I'm not able to quite put them on the same pedestal that said nothing is absolute like he's sort of talking about there's no black and white so I sometimes do read\nContemporary books and sometimes I Do watch contemporary television for the most part I don't watch much t._v.

I'm getting old and listen to what's going on uh I Do listen to music um because I Do feel it's genuine it doesn't say anything\nTo me is that speak to me well no pop music a tool that really\nA need to be apologetic by the way [laughter]\nI mean yeah I'm interested in music that is kind of you know personal to the past and and as unusual as well\nI've been listening to the ethics twin recently which I find fascinating 'cause I'm I'm very much into using technology at the moment and manipulating field recordings and making up my own sort of three south to these fountains sounds\nSo yeah it's been very inspiring listening to this music and and so the genus that you know it creates it and yeah last time I do like discovering new stuff and working with different people you know it makes you a musician and concise as well [noise] we\nCan teach the show today with some Algerian Desert ... from the bond cold in my hand\nThat from ... and they mix urban sound production with ... great that debut album is called connect and joining a night session at the BBC they played one offend you checks no ... ... ...\nHe had ...

loneliness and has carried out an experiment for a program called all in the mind it's discovered that young people are the most likely to feel lonely more than fifty five thousand people to pilots making it the biggest study of known in is in the world\nPeople age between sixteen and twenty four experienced loneliness more often and more intense the than any on the age group Coney Hammond is the present of health check on the BBC will set us\nSo we found that forty percent of the people in that age group said that they often ill very often felt lonely and then gradually as people get older that number went down but still over Seventy five twenty seven percent was saying that they are always often felt lonely\nNow of course these figures are quite high and it's partly it was it was on line to people could decide themselves whether it's type ... so that made it might have made in the higher of rule but I think what is really striking is these differences between the age groups\nSo that people were telling us that they felt disconnected that they felt left out\nI'm On that they didn't fail\nYou know a comfortable in the neighborhoods necessarily that they wasn't somebody they could um you know bar a little bit of money from in the streets in an emergency if they needed to\nThe boys that isn't because older people are more resilient to worries about loneliness\nI think that's really good point I think one of the things is that we know that\nWhen you're very young it is a time when people feel emotions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness and older people may have the experience to have learned that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and that usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the Lebanese civil they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it something about life I think the main ways of being the case it was just never measured before may be used as a time when you feel more lend me and that's interesting because there's\nGoing to ask about social media but you said older people have felt known in when they were younger but Britain is the lonely ... capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas as a newbie make eye contact and that in itself can be quite ...\nYes and we did all the the ... if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and also and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type pops\nAnd in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that I'm at the the UK and then and I'm from in the U.S has kind of comparable levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting\nAnd we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at\nWhich countries are places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they have high levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other more and be happy to depend on each other\nSo being independent does not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister or any of this yeah told you set up punching levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with as which is what you were pointing to in being independent how'd you sold this though what's the strategy\nWe off people ... ... for them and the closer to something as big as it is to find out what is actually what for people for people they know that is

ground but see no significant rain in several many sons has said this is clearly to global warming it seems\nFrom the perspective of the climate of about a hundred years ago and if we use that as our benchmark than these temperatures that are occurring some of the cities that are getting remarkably high readings here in the U.S\nUCLA and Southern California in the six of July forty four degree Celsius well over a hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit those are remarkable temperatures in Oman which is on the mouth of the Persian Gulf this was for the overnight low temperature for\nThree degrees Celsius into perspective of a hundred years of data\nThese are indicating a warming planet and in terms of how normal if you will the temperatures have been for the first half of two thousand and Eighteen overland the temperatures are running about one and a quarter degrees Celsius above the twentieth century reference\nI wrote a piece of Michael thank you for a meteorologist MSN back in July for BBC San see an action as the weather extremes would just playing out but that was the beginning of it and then the next two editions of discovery I intend to look deep into ... the connection is between global warming and with the weather\nIs uh some progress so I've been following the postings from the but the U.S project a Clemence logical investigative group which detailed new records as they cropped up I've been looking forward to hearing about that was from that sons directs a robot rosy\nI very much a data nerd I have\nLiterally billions of temperature measurements sun by computers so that we do a lot of climate reconstruction and things like this explore toy data analysis are looking at various ways we can find interesting signals and the observations\nThan those big banks effects come from thousands of weather stations across the planet\nTens of thousands actually the currently active temperature network there's about twenty thousand stations and if you include all the stations that were historically active but aren't running today it's about forty five thousand\nAmong the charts robot posted was one showing day by day if and when one of those weather stations showing a record temperature for that date of the year and this summer it will all live with five she's afraid\nJapan has been hit by to Vassar again as a heat wave cause us to solve the region

Portugal three people have\nDied heat wave called ethic country tries to recover from the worst flooding Japan has seen in decades\nNow one of the analysis is this map of where have we seen records through the last several months\nAnd you can watch the heat waves as they move across the U.S and then sometimes at the same time sometimes at different times you see heat waves in the u._k. and Scandinavia in particular\nWhich saw all time record highs and you also see heat waves that march with the weather patterns across Asia and you know go from almost all the way from Europe to like\nJapan and some of these things are happening at the same time and some of them are displaced a little bit of time but basically most of the northern hemisphere was affected by heat waves at some point this summer\nMy own experience if this dramatic some it was the prolonged heat wave in the u._k. which reminded me of the previous record some weight back in Nineteen Seventy six went on sticking exams at school [noise] twenty Eighteen just squeaked into the record books on some counts\nFor England not the case a whole we ended up having the hottest summer on record the u._k. as a whole basically tied with some of the previous years\nBut it was a very substantial heat wave and the you know if you look at not the summer as a whole but individual days there were times where you had stations setting all time records and it does get a little repetitious that we look at you know it's hot it's still hot and it's going to get hotter\nAnd you know you can compared to previous\nYears so for example back in Nineteen Seventy six when the u._k. was having a major heat wave and the u._k. summer that was similar to the u._k. summer this year but in that year it was only the u._k. there was having this major heat event whereas\nThis year with the heat events you know spread\nAll across the world and those broad swath of heat are was concerning factors of global warming\nAnd I guess for the u._k. I've had to wait for four years to see that ... broken boats on the other hand there have been quite a lot of hot summers\nIn the past decade and I'll probably won't have to wait another forty years for it to be broken again in fact that the rate we're going by twenty fifty or so you would expect about half\nThe year is to be as warm as this year\nIncreasing numbers of climate scientists of digging into these weather data to understand better the impacts of global warming among them Oxford University Freddie also a founding member of the world where the attribution project which is already analyzed the European heat wave\nInteresting thing about global a more so when all that rain all thing no pressure and all in all in Europe may and then\n... ... I don't understand why they were very very warm summer winter\nAnd it was so widespread as well\nIt was a scenario and that's how all Nolan Europe at this way I think it's also interesting or surprising all that old time we'll wait and all and had a chair so that we're all the way to pattern that way he lived in North America is a long tail or\nAre they supposed to talk with all the way it was just a long way and\nOf course is the whole life but I think the biggest difference between for example the ... takes ... that was a big heat wave aware\nThat when he ran wild in Europe and not only that we had a ... a law now in Europe including one that we're also the heat wave shot one that different times over the summer and the rest of the northern hemisphere and I think that well that's what we ask\nWell maybe than I Am\nThe hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all kinds of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... La Nina setting and I would imagine that twenty eight team was going to be ...\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the uh system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nAnd then of course the lump sum it was crowned by a series of enormous storms super typhoons J. B. and mine quote in the western Pacific in fact another super typhoon Treme is developing after this break\nFrom an as an American Florence which quickly developed after long quiet season in the Atlantic North Carolina is still recovering from the flooding\nI called Florence a climate change triple threat climatologist Michael Mann was quick to ... to global warming up first of all the storm intensified very rapidly within a couple of days\nFrom a moderate tropical storm to a major category for hurricane\nUm that happened very quickly and we understand that warmer temperatures favor this phenomenon of rapid intensification now the stronger those storms the stronger the wins the more wind damage that can be done and there was a a fair amount of wind damage even as we can does it made landfall but here's the other thing\nWhen it was spinning out there off the Atlantic seaboard as a monster category ... storm for several days that build up a huge storm surge so it didn't really matter that the storm technically weekends to only a category one hurricane on the east coast of the U.S North Carolina in particular\nFelt the storm surge of a large category for storm and that did catastrophic flooding there is a town New Bern right on the coast it was basically in and day to do was flooded the entire downtown area was flooded well\nLess than a year ago last October actually gave a talk at a church in New Bern North Carolina where I talked about the coastal risk associated with climate change and it was just a matter of time before new burned in the Carolina coast was going to\nSuffer those consequences and sadly was prophetic because the very church where I spoke was flooded by this storm so there was the coastal flooding due to the storm surge\nAnd let's come back to those very warm ocean temperatures there's a relationship to climate change there\nIn the same temperatures that intensified the storm also meant that there was much more moisture in the storm more moisture that it was able to turn into unprecedented rainfall when it made landfall and here's the final ingredient because what really made it a catastrophic flooding event just like Hurricane Harvey last year\nOnce it made landfall it just stayed there for several days continuing to rain on those same inland locations and there are enough studies was a study published in nature earlier this year\nShowing that climate change is in fact leading to a greater tendency for these storms to stall when they make landfall and that was really the final climate change threat that we saw play out\n[noise] the last place I Want to look is the region with climate change is having the solstice effect\nIn the Arctic did to his being affected by the unusual weather is twenty eight seed in fact the impact that were parents first says Lacey always just Judy ... from the U.S national snow and ice data center\nPoll we had record Los yes conditions over the winter and we look at you know if you look at air temperatures over the winter\nCertainly December was I think the one that we've recorded in January February when maybe the second warmest months out of the winters since Nineteen eighty so I mean definitely had very unusual winter conditions Andy's winter warm temperatures are starting to impact sea ice growth\nI mean to put this seems to me that this is it gets warm when the sun's shining the main thing about the Arctic cases not shining the north pole on December the twenty second\nRight but what we have seen happening in the history of the last um three winters as we're having these storms that are tracking up into the Arctic bringing warm moist air so in the wintertime if you have ... coming up to the Arctic they're actually going to bring in warm moist air that can help ... the surface even in the middle of winter\nUm whereas in the summertime if you have a cycling coming in usually that's says it was cooler conditions you're blocking sunlight and maybe you would have less the ice melt so the cycle and are different depending on what time of year the coming into the Arctic\nAnd and one thing we have noticed I mean we don't necessarily see a change in cycling frequency in the wintertime necessarily with sea ice loss right now but we are seeing maybe an increase frequency of extreme cycling\nAnd they're trying to detract further north so the ice age and winter's pushing for North any cycle to actually tracking it further than they used to which can impact the sea ice especially like into carrying the banner and see where they usually come in in the wintertime\nDespite that very pull start the Arctic ice has not melted as fast this summer as it did in twenty twelve you wear a big regional storm pushed melting to the current record\nIn part that's because the flip side of those heat waves in the Americas Europe in Siberia who's being a cold ... system polo over the north pole but that's little comfort to Judy and ... says the strong decline in Arctic ice is still in evidence for him the trend ... since the exceptional yeah twenty seven\nI Would say that this summer circulation patterns we had in two thousand seven if that happened today we would have\nA new record low because it was a very unusual summer as well not in terms of a big storm coming in and you had this high pressure that persisted over the Beaufort Sea\nAll summer long and under high pressure you tend to have clear skies you have a lot of solar radiation hitting the ice\nThat that was that high pressure was coupled with low pressure over Siberia for example and so what that did is it created a very strong pressure gradient between high and low pressure centers which brought warm winds from the south into the Arctic Sea funneled all this warm went\nInto the Arctic he also pushed the ice away from the coast of Siberia and Alaska towards the north pole\nAnd you help flush more I set of friends straight so all of those things happened\nAnd that was able to cause at first to record low that we saw in two thousand seven which also took scientists by surprise because we didn't think he could lose that much ice that quickly\nAnd it did show that the ice has become quite vulnerable to these unusual atmospheric patterns because the ISIS thin enough now that if you have\nA very strong circulation pattern that sets up that will favor ice melt you going to lose a lot of ice very quickly if you have a strong come in and depending on the time of year that it comes in and where it comes in because you have a vulnerable ice pack 'cause it's thin it can create a lot of damage\nAnd so what happened in the Arctic is is the weather is benign you're still going to have less sea ice but it won't be as dramatic\nBut if you have a dramatic weather pattern that comes in you're going to lose a lot of ice very quickly\nAnd I think that's what we're seeing is just that vulnerability has increased for having a dramatic ice loss event\nIt's definitely a matter of when not if for the melting records will be broken\nAnd it was the opposite because it the rapidly changing conditions there that many scientists suspect oddest stapling whether fall away I'll be talking about that in next week's edition of discovery with the BBC\nAnd those pushing the view include climatologist Michael Mann who says we should smart enough to the connection between global warming and changing whether\nGlobal warming doesn't cause a meteorological event to happen what it does is it can take that event and it can intensified in various ways\nHurricanes can become stronger they can carry more moisture with them and deal more flooding potential and or even these mid latitude storm systems\nCan be much greater flooding threats in these high pressure centers in the summer are becoming deeper and hotter and that's where we are seeing record breaking heat and drought and wildfires break out so it's intensifying these weather systems in a way\nThat is doing great damage and it's a relevant to ask did climate change you know caused this storm to form it's a question we can never really answered the better question is once this storm began to form was it intensified by climate change\nAnd we now have great confidence that in many ways the answer is yes\n\nYou are listening to community supported public radio TV and can you teach do you want to

promoting massive new infrastructure projects like this proposed mega say the thousand Beijing\nIt's definitely going to be something but the question mark is if the market will follow this government let decisions that's that risk\nQuite what do schemes like this imply for China's growing mountain of debt business daily from the BBC [noise]\nLet's begin today's program that with the latest news a bit of positive economic news as well\nThe United states and Canada have settled that trade differences for the time being at least enough to sign a revised deal a successor to the NAFTA agreement long decried by president Donald Trump this came right at the last minute before Trump imposed deadline on Sunday\nThe deal will result in free markets fair trade and robust economic growth in our region according\nTo integrate statement between the two countries Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau was asked about the deal by reporters as he left his office late last night [laughter]\nAnd they had\nA good day for Canada you may just of the lower grade but from me excuse me the R B the wealth management company she told the BBC's dominant Laurie ah earlier today that this came as a great relief to say much trade disruption of light\nIt appears that we had seen some concessions on really three key contentious issues that but really sticking points in the agreement so one is around the Gary ... in Canada and to supply management is quite a protected industry so we are seeing that that will be open somewhat to the to other markets like the U.S and Mexico\nBut as well when we look at that speed sediment mechanism that is still going to remain in place which was something that candidate had pushed for and then when we look it looks like there's a site agreement as well but to respect the auto cats and the fact that threats on Canadian idols have sound like it could be an issue so it does look to the favorable for all parties and don't\nPay as you say well so traumatic listen to the ... just in the last few months before the midnight deadline of last night with with trade ministers flying around the place or do you think is a bit of a template if so what might happen between us and China the much bigger tradable which is blaming\nLike to get a positive for risk sentiment I Would say that it does signal of the fact that we could see more conciliatory tone between the U.S and China emerge but I Would say that's more of a medium term issue and really near term it's going to be continued further escalation with the trade dispute out on those two parties\nKnow recover talking to them and take a call while as indicated President Trump's trade war with China\nDoes show no sign of slowing down of the night last week introduced fresh Paris on two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports John and return is that it sixty million\nDollars all of us products to his import tariff list all of this spot by Mr Trump's accusations that China has been seeking to steal us intellectual property limited access to its marketing unfairly subsidizing state owned Chinese companies\nI'm joined now in the studio by George magnets he's a former chief economist UPS he's got a new book red flags why China why she's China is under threat\nChina on George is a big theme in today's program stuff do you see any reason for optimism here that this North American deal might pave the way for Trans Pacific they told\nA no not really because I think the um the the discussions which the United states has been having with Mexico and Canada um are really about the terms under which the country's trade with one another [noise]\nThe terrorists or the turf war the trade war that's going on between the American China is sensibly about the terms of trade but actually underneath it's really much more existential it's about\nUh the struggle for technological leadership or for ... tree dominance and about the rules and regulations governing accepted rules and regulations governing\nIndustrial policy intellectual property as soon as you indicated just now and I ... I think uh this is going to go on for quite some time I mean Jack Ma recently founder of Ali Baba uh recently said he felt betrayed well would go on for Twenty years I don't know about that but it's very difficult to see an off ramp moment\nHow um how how they affecting China's economy do we know yet ah too early to say yeah\nWell I mean it is beginning to clip 'em up the margin wherever the Chinese economy um be a very closely watch series of business sentiment indicators for September or who just came out to actually uh before we were on their\nUm indicated that the economy had a we can through September we export sector of the economy was beginning to um contracts actually out in the margin\nOr so I'm obviously it's not the biggest thing in China because China is not really a kind of a such a trade dependent economy anymore but it's it's big but it has a lot of\nInfluence over your employment and uh uh conditions for companies particularly in the coastal areas\nYes and we do know that we already that China's internal cause human to mom was decreasing that has been a chilling effect in recent years on on on China's own economies that have been precious they're ready for president she\nYes I'm I'm I think the reason for that just because at the beginning of two thousand Seventeen\nUm China embarked on this I'm a sort of crack down on finance to try to um a kind of limited but certainly climbed down on the most egregious forms of risk taking them for natural malpractice and it's been quite successful in some respects\nA in the sense that um you know leverage in the economy borrowing and bad behavior by a by banks and financial companies actually as being a child and so the consequence of that country has being we can economic growth and and uh weakening investment\nWe're gonna come back to all of that in just a moment George stay with us a China has general worries of course one of them is this debt problem and it's often brought about\nWhere it

apparently there is some uncertainty about how much warning was given how much preparedness what would you say\nThe fact is the national buddy for natural disasters already initiated the early warning for at least a half an hour at the time\nIt's just that because they are the people who are not aware of the condition there was a a an event or kind of festival around the shore so they didn't really know that what was coming after the earthquake or a pie into debt so it's very quickly and it happens that way [noise]\n[noise] but the warning was lifted wasn't it's not not it wasn't the people not

there was no time to go with the with the situation is very quickly\nI mean it's a time now for trying to recover people and rescue he's all but I Will just one more point to which has been made about

you're supposed to keep records but sometimes a ... records were done sloppy\nOr some landmines exploded for natural causes new ones who were put in place records were lost so very hard to tell I mean you're still there\nAnd I've spoken in the process to de miners who say actually even if you have accurate charts mine's actually move the ground shifts\nYes that's very direct especially when you have rain comes the mind will move our own and it becomes an extra danger\nBut this is an important step forward isn't it in in the relationship between the two Koreas do accept that that is at least the good news here\n[noise] yes uh it is the good news um so the mining itself is not the\nPurpose year we're going to do the ... de mining of the area so that recovery remains a soldiers who have

meant maintain a republic\nBut I've been speaking of David Collins who is Canadian but he's also professor of international economic law at City University here in London one area of dispute involves the importation of cars so I asked professor Collins what's changed in that area\nWhat seems to happen in this new negotiated agreement is that the Americans have put a close eye on the volume of cars which Canada can't export to the U.S without being subject to a potential of truck car specific tariffs\nAnd thankfully that quote just seems to be significantly beyond what Canada currently exports to the u._s. so I'm not concerned that that's going to be particularly relevant at least in the short term\nOn the other hand the access that the U.S farmers will have to the dairy market that was something that Kennedy was resistant to agreeing so what's been settled there\nWhile the U.S is going to have access to increase it free point five percent of candidates dairy market which doesn't seem like much but it is significant and I'm delighted at this development you're absolutely right it was a concession on the part of Canada it was something that candidate didn't want to give up but they should have given it up\nThere's no need for that very sector to have been protected in Canada for as long as it was and I think that's an excellent she went on under the new agreement ... you

hasn't spoken but to his negotiate to his we'll see how they ... she said we celebrate the friday Laffer agreement so underlining the fact that his try not to he said it closes the door to trade
