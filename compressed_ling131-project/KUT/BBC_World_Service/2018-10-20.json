{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "To develop a feel for the United states of America great seal a two sided emblem they want it to marketing materials for this new country they just formed and anyway these three talked with a design and Congress doesn't like it they rejected they come up with another design\nBy but Franklin in the ... and that process came up with three words that Congress did like in those three words were Latin word ...\nHe took those words not from a great Roman thinker but rather from like a magazine he liked it called gentleman's magazine\nIt was a literary magazine and on the cover where these words he pluribus unum\nOut of many one and what they were trying to say in the in the magazine was out of many fragments of literary works one magazine what he he he thought is out of many states and people's one nation and and I think what he understood it really very early was that diversity difference created great strengths for the country\nBut what was going to create that unity it was going to be our belief a common belief in democratic self\nGovernance so as we look at conflict I think it's maybe a fool's errand to try to suppress conflict the question is do we have enough in common to hold it together\n\nBecause scientists have noticed that both parties are becoming more ideologically consistent in other words Republicans a more conservative and Democrats are more liberal than they used to be I asked David of this kind of polarization might be leading to destructive conflict\nLook we don't know if I Want to be careful history and history and I look backwards I'm not so good at predicting the future and I think none of us are so we don't know if this type of conflict is itself dangerous I guess I'm I'm not convinced that it is I think a much bigger concern and if you look at for example Gallup asked this question on a regular basis [noise]\n... if you ask do you have confidence in your fellow Americans to make decisions as part of our democracy actually that number has been following\nUp quite dramatically and the number who say that they have little or no confidence and their fellow Americans has increased sharply from that Fifteen Percent in the early Nineteen Seventy two about forty three percent today those are those are big numbers I've just say I worry much more about those numbers than ideological conformity and someone\nThat I think the question is do you have some faith in those around you even if you disagree with them sharply do you believe\nIn the system are you willing when you lose to accept it and are you going to be treated with some degree of respect when you lose as well you know as we think about winning and losing we have to lose with grace and we have to win with grace as well and maybe we just have to be careful not to let the winning and losing become value of its own\nI'm Wondering as you're thinking about the long sweep of history it's clear there have been many many many examples where things look like they're falling apart and they have it\nAnd the case you make as a result is that the country's resilient but I'm Wondering if this belief in our resilience can hide the fact that sometimes actually we might be addressed in other words it's only in hindsight that you know there are certain things turned out to rent or badly in the moment how do you know which way it's going to go\nRight so I think you need to look at\nIs the culture of democracy strong enough to hold us together that's the question I keep asking how do you know you need to look at your politicians look at the ones on your side\nWho agree with you and do you see them ever putting democracy in second place and how often\nDo they do it all so\nI'll leave it to listeners to to make that decision my guess is you can find some examples of that and you can find examples in history the more severe that becomes the more dangerous it becomes\nIt's good I think in a democracy to be hypochondriacs that is to think that our system might be thing because when you think it might be second you start to take some action\nOne of the factors you identify that's different about partisanship today from boxes and ship in the past is that you see partisanship in the past was more ... what do you mean by an exuberant partisanship and how could we bring that back\nSo as you say I think if you if you go back into the nineteenth century partisanship was extremely extremely strong but if there was a there was a ... a life in it and excitement and that came out for example\nBeautifully on election day election day was a celebration it was a party it was completely different from election day today what do I mean by that well back then actually voting was public\nYou would go and cast a ballot you're about usually had a caller i._d. paint get might be blew 'em and it was reflect what party or voting for everyone could see when you put the ballot and [noise] and\nThere were a lot of people around you in fact usually at your vote and I think that you're voting place there was a celebration going on there was a lot of ah debating there was a lot of drinking there was a lot of fighting there was a lot going on overall the voting rights were up at Seventy Seventy five eighty percent or so very high voting rights much higher than we have today\nSo there was this celebratory atmosphere was going on at every election and part of that was something we wouldn't want to repeat so ah you know why we're a ballot so public why was voting so public well part of it was political machines wanted to be able to pay people off to vote for their party [noise]\nAnd you couldn't really pay people off if you couldn't see how they were going to vote so if you're going to pay them a dollar to vote this way or that you had to make sure you knew um how they're actually gonna votes he had to see you had to have someone at the polling place watch them I put the put the vote and so there was a downside there was a corruption associated with the with the solar system\nBut unfortunately when we fixed that we ended up taking the life out of voting and now most people do they vote they vote in a private booth and they make their decision they walk out maybe by a brownie to bake sale or something and that's about it\nBut there is a question could we have a little bit more of that celebrate tore atmosphere could election day B a B holiday could it be more of a celebration and what you see is a lot more people engaged in the democracy\n... so we got a cleaner electoral system ... wouldn't want to give that up but boy we lost something in the promise\nHave in mind is the author of democracy a case study he's a historian at Harvard University\nThis

week on this week identity politics around the world people are demanding attention based on their identity on their race sex or cough groups such as black lives matter challenged and opposed by blue lives matter or movements the light Paolo algae Beatty rights\nI think he's the moms to be included in the public debate legitimate what do they undermine social and political ... by attacking a brute a common identity based perhaps all nationality or religion is so cool to identity politics just a new name for an age old struggle waged by the powerless against the powerful\nCould the fragmentation of society and to have a smaller groups threatened democracy including the future of the very political policies who's deployed it as the U.S midterm elections approach will be examining whether identity politics ... democratic facade is that's the real story from the BBC coming up off the news\nAnd then the same way actually identity politics as quickly come to be appropriated by people who are in favor of tax so I I agree but originally it was pejorative\nBut now there's this phrase which a lot which is all politics into politics and that's one of the coal claims of people who want to defend the mood of politics and I think it's an important claim because it is important to be wrong\nAt the very hard to debate corporate preventative democracy is the idea that we can strive for common good for public but the ... is an idea of something but we have in common as citizens of the country irrespective\nOf our religion of our skin color which part of the country or from or what kinds of economic interests who might have and I think we give up on that idea altogether and the phrase all politics is identity politics does give up on that phrase when a lot of trouble\n... do you see these things right I think it's pointing out that the people who often make plans on the basis of abstract universal or abstract commonalities\nAre not lacking in identity I think it's simply pointing out more as a basic fact as a line of sight were born into groups um and very often what are we choose to or\nNot to I live with these groups we get treated in ways that are gender and why is that a racialized in ways that have to do with cloth\nSo we can truly all be about the fantasy land where we choose what we want to be on you know it'd be lovely but actually but we moving toward that shouldn't show or I don't accept the ... to ... examined binary between commonality indifference we cannot write that commonality through debt friends\nMost civil rights that we enjoy today will fought for and they were fought for on the basis off\nGroups wanting to be pulled off the common good\nWill go out at the same time many groups age right in different sides you define themselves primary against other groups rather than saying really what they're about and how that might relate to\nThe other but I don't think about the rights groups there or not they're not saying oh we want to be simply different and they are able to look at what's coming out like through the difference is whether they are situate that it's not about who you are or who you identify with the way you stand\nIn the larger structural a society\nAdrian past sure it is about ... aren't the same time if you compare the civil rights movement and say you know Martin Luther king and others\nTo some of the movements today what's the big difference Martin Luther king kept on saying this is about being Americans about all people in America being able to partake of that common life\nShow ... to democracy and sell them whereas a lot of groups today primarily say we want to play my different and we have nothing in common with others and that's where the government they are going on for a while yeah of course black lives matter keep on saying we have to be treated differently because\nNow I live in Manhattan and I don't know I I think and second I Want to do is hit just hear the voices of ... matches campaign as in Chicago\n[laughter] [noise]\nVegetarian wind carries carries Ronald John Kerry\nIs on the brink all bought out and in practice probably [laughter]\n\n\nSo that some of the ... of a campaign is who are protesting against police brutality pre out how would you define that place than in the spectrum\nIt's very clear they're saying exactly the opposite of what a tree and just sat there saying we are being treated differently we'll being singled out by the police and it is only when black lives matter\nCan we say that all lives matter so it's actually saying we want to be knocked\nSingled out we want to not be treated as different\nAnd you know and Martin Luther king that's a very sanitized kind of white ... should have Martin Luther king that floats around\nMartin Luther king didn't just say well we all want to be Americans one called me all the American he was not a he was not but in all in that way he understood that certain groups were excluded from what was pretending to be a universal ideal and he was saying that in order to achieve equality of citizenship\nAfrican Americans hatched a such that rights to civil right yeah we actually\nHave ... you're the one who are making just making it slightly of simplified binary because you I was describing a position which the race doesn't matter at all and we're just against injustice and be abstract and we don't recognize his ... ways in which obviously has been instantly as racial injustice\nUm oh everything needs to become about identity and but we sort of lose out of science ... society where met us led I think what we don't think ... between how Martin Luther king and by the way bronco bomb it talked about those things and how some people into space\nTo talk about it is it they said why should we care for example when African Americans are being discriminated against and how do we argue about that the majority population and one of the ... as you claim to care about universal principles you claim to care\nAbout the principles in the constitution and when you look at the American south right now you see these principles are being violated so you as an American have a reason to struggle against injustice Adrian ... we have some common as Americans and that has the right way I think would put his name was ... ...\nBy off and on piled high density politics that I was given black lives matter to you from the accepts that we just listened to the black lives matter one off a a different\nIdea of how well the point is you have to build bridges between differences so that people can build a common life and have a meaningful democracy in an economy that is actually open tools to the point of our identity politics at its base clues of ways the sense of belonging that everyone can shatter needs to redo the thing\nAbout what can I throw in a different at an event or if this is the difference between identity politics as we're talking about it now\nFrom say a civil rights movement to the sixties city that many more people have access to these ideas have access to claim on an identity whether it's through education whether it's through social media is that ... with Lionel Shriver\nI think we're certainly dealing with a movement that started in education that is on American campuses though it's certainly spread beyond that\nBut I'm saying it's a function of people being welfare having more access to to having a voice because they can access the media because they can have social media to spread their ideas in a way that just wasn't pulse\nOf yourself as a social media has something to do with it but I think that if you look at social media one of the things that distinguishes the character the conversation that's being had\nOn line from the civil rights era in the United states in the Nineteen sixties is a tone of of antagonism and hostility and even a tendency toward\nPredation it's that hostility toward the majority often from other white people ironically who are in competition with each other for who can seem more virtuous and more woke\nYou'll see that that is alienating to the white majority and I think that naturally gives birth to white identity politics\nIs it the ... that actually is destructive is there is a destructive force and all of this\nIf there isn't bent on us it is one that has been set up by the majority this is the key points that the charges that are being made of antagonism and hostility and\nFat protests them are in fact what is being done to people um what is really interesting to me about the kind of white victim\nNarratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege being coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed\nAnd actually feeling that no loss of ... which is outrageous\nAnd we thought rather an important point Adrian ... is it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand by techno classic can lead spending like abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have most of my knowledge she ... she was bumped his shoes off and I think none of it is very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim on whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue message to any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression mixed protection\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always repeating what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ... if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply don't recognize that but that's exactly in fact walk\nTo the beauty movement did they said look this is love we love like everybody out there don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately want in the cars exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so

from the b._b._c. World Service with me with a shop this week quit looking at identity politics and I'm joined by Russia monk Adrian pops Lionel Shriver and the embargo Paul and with us tough we talked about what lies behind the rise of our awareness of identity politics\nWhether or not it's new I think remains debatable\nBut if we move away from that and think a bit more about the impact of this fracturing well regrouping of people and causes\nAnd its effects on traditional politics\nLet's consider the changing political landscape the the election of Donald Trump immediately comes to mind and also traditional Republican or a conservative but certainly ... and then you view of politics [noise]\nDoes that view those people who backed him does that voice come at the expense of authors ...\nI think the um Trump phenomenon in the United states are definitely does some of its rise to a identity politics and if it's in reaction against it the shrill note that I observed earlier\n... is alienating to the majority and if I saw the statistics recently I Wish I could quote them but the proportion of white Americans who believe that they are the primary victims of discrimination in the United states is shockingly high\nAnd of course I look at that and I say well that's ridiculous but it's you know that's what they feel\nAnd it's partly the results of of fifty years of affirmative action so you know they feel discriminated against and um they look at what is often a a certain amount of casual racism against white people in the identity politics conversation\nAnd think that will you know someone has to stick up for us and you know I wouldn't simplified the Trump phenomenon as only coming from this small campus movement\nBut it hasn't helped and this way of of talking about people and prioritizing issues has definitely infected the Democratic party and is also alienating middle of the road and independent voters who might otherwise be on board\nPre I Wonder how you view this this changing of the political landscape\nYeah well that's a couple of things to say I'm really struck by the way of saying what she says in fact a sudden form of white identity politics um that Brostrom to power everyone else's child should identity politics and not the majority of the majority is playing\nA is being made to play a role that identity politics what I find interesting is the ways in which although we talk all the time about how fat snaps and help the truth matters and how fake news is a problem suddenly feelings\nHurt feelings of the majority of become the basis on which entire country is run their elections I mean what else feelings\nIf I feel that there are too many black people around which in fact does not borne out by the staff affirmative action has brought ... fairly small number of black people [laughter] nowhere near proportional into academia for instance I feel\nAffirmative action is upsetting but it does that have any bearing with reality are we discussing reality where the facts what is the truth\nWell on the structures I also find the ideal reverse racism really states just to see as river sexism the point is that racism and sexism are about Alice tucked [laughter]\nOkay so you can't really punch up well it's you can't you can't really say racist against white people white people don't suffer structurally\nNational races so a few points here first the Ford unfortunately or I Would say fortunately we live in democracies and an amongst you have to have these somewhat above the feelings of the majority because otherwise you vote for people like Donald Trump and but as a disaster for everybody especially from the most vulnerable so what I'm concerned with is how do we actually win democratic elections\nAround ideals that are going to help us come together as a society and help us fight discrimination rather than in French and so the reason to cabbage and feelings of people is but in a democracy you need to win over to cause in order to be a political\nMatter of fact we can't we can't and ... and the name of the\nLike I didn't think I'm I'm Talking about in countries like the other thing is that I I Do find it quite striking that you describe Donald Trump is wider than to politics which I think it's up to ...\nAnd ... and it's up to find a counter that with different kinds of fun to say that well actually I find it's not Donald am puzzled by officials in my mouth and finished offering you about Trump precisely shows what's the problem is with conception of politics but says we're going to fight for our group and for our side and we don't care about anything else prayer\nSo we should have a son have action because that upsets white people for the best thing to do is to deny a disenfranchised group fair access to writes in order that the majority of not they hook\nVerify but I did not say anything about affirmative action but what is interesting about affirmative action is that when you look in the United states for example eighty five percent of Americans including boss majorities of people of color and the United states against it so I'm not sure who's speaking on behalf of camps you\nI Want to move away from that point and bring you in a dream we were talking about this idea a that's a different interest groups fighting against each other in a political system is that in a sense because the establishment the establish policies\nActually has no convincing message new overarching message to to tell people what should you not like the\n[noise] I mean it's a big uh issue today and so many different a democratic countries and indeed others where I think the elites establishments simply a representative\nThat often very smoothly groups and yes often do you watch any groups but then as I said he groups which actually then bring about the system is unjust almost a father why people and many more such small the case that injustice and he lives with my allergies\nYou cannot ... wide working class populations in certain countries that are simply not be the winners of globalization off you know open borders and and and all that kind of consensus that we've had for the for the last ... years in terms of the two the two main policies\nSo that come in on that place um I find that the W. W. see either white working class has a very interesting construct\nWatching sausage this as a whole have not done while on the working class as as a whole or not white that they too white people but they're all working classes who have been at the shopping of globalization up near liberalism of capitalism if pressed\nTheir ... because they're working ... not because that ... there was no evidence to tell us that the white looking classes are doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino black working class which\nIs an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in Bavaria what happened that as a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see a few which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of it the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been hemorrhage face the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant AFDC on the other meanwhile the SP deep which is the leftist sent about ... ... ...\nIt seems to lose his entourage choosing policies which have clear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and the biggest face people pushing themselves into these\nWell I think now because the mainstream parties I'm offering something that's inclusive and off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with that of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working tells us off with an often suffered more than the white working class but\nSaying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide also you know will rebel against us sanctions quote and and who reached to tell them to somehow bad and the masses less and less of all this how does not like I said I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nOther people are going to keep imposing a kind of identity or at least a struggle on you\nThere there is an extra there is an extra fight to be an individual in that circumstance [noise]\nUm but you know we we\nAre as individuals also free to carve out who we are to ourselves and to an extent who we are to others um you know I left the United states I was born in America I live here in the u._k. for over Thirty years\nThat was a decision I took and it has abridged\nAlbeit not obliterated my American ness so I I expanded my borders if you will and that was my decision and it's been a very good one\nSo it makes me feel like a larger and more interesting person certainly my life is larger and more interesting so I was able to uh get out or or at least expand the bubble into which I was born\n... still has an American accent that people are going to make assumptions about background without pops even knowing how long she said to\nThis negotiation between who we think we are who people decide we all for whatever reason for our accent for our skin color or we're being told wedding show on how much does that then\nNegate the idea of this big or I didn't see in a world where being ... being encouraged to\nAssess how so to speak up can you go back to if you like an old school I did and much more hierarchical weld where's the adults who the much bigger broader light and see\nWhether there's any way you can go back to uh to go out and there's no such thing as a golden age that we should ever look back on with the full ... so there are lots of you know inequalities forms of oppression exploitation of policy we wouldn't want to revisit even if we could\nAll be content on history in in any case but I think the important thing to say that they would always be some forms of hierarchy whether it's a power or wealth those states is involved and saying we should move from how rich you to not use the questions what sort of bizarre but hockey's might they be Vincent ... hockey's of excellence\nHow the votes you they will be very difficult there'll be contested\nBut we Tom somehow pretend that there's a world without hierarchy of the world without power rug without defenses in wealth in states has sent problem is when when small groups often it leads\nThe pasta older leads new classes or new groups come on the block and simply want to claim the hockey for themselves rather what we should have as a ... actually works around you know roles\nTalents vacations and actually give everyone a sense of dignity which hasn't been an ... recognition\n... shares kind of a liberal fundamentalism that we will always have higher all can ... what kind of ... we have\nI you know I'm all for the human imagination and the human imagination has many times through history and in many places envision will without hierarchy what people are in fact able to be at once individual and\nPart of the collective good so I actually don't buy a we talked about you know the extreme left in the extreme right we need to talk about the extreme sent to an extreme liberalism as well you know these are the banal ideas about high rocky and tribalism and this is the way that human beings are and always will be I don't think that is the case I think human beings evolved\nI think the imagination involved in political imaginations changed kind of no\nReal idea what any of it meant but um and I know Katie I'm ... I Want to go back to what kind of society we should and visit and and imagine I'm On the question you asked about whether it'll ever be possible to get away from your identity entirely\nA I'm a liberal democracy which means but um for society where people have a a great amount of freedom and fashioning the life and that means that some people will deeply identify with the groups of him and say\nI was ... a religious Muslim and I want to be able to not just not be white but\nWhere for example the headscarf and be accepted as a full member of the society and treated a with equal dignity and respect but very much leave within my comment um sense of my life around ... percent of my life on passed on at the same time I also think I Want to live in a society in which the same person can grow up\nAnd make the choice about where to come from the time to come from this can kind of religion is not an old important to them and they don't want that to play a very large role in the lives at all\nAnd at the moment I think the vision that society which has doubled freedom is W ... it's ... from the radical right it's ... some people are like Donald Trump who wants to discriminate you don't want to recognize people have different skin causing them as these as equal but it's also affecting from people who say\nEverything is identity everything's going to be your top national belonging and there's no getting away from that\nAgent is that how you see a a a democracy that threaten from the radical right on the radical left\nAlmost certainly is that it's also threatened by the kind of a high liberalism that says that we're just all ruthless isolates individuals with nothing in common with anyone else so we we want to I think generally limited all those extremes and get back to the conversation about belonging about the things that we have in common his workers\nAs men and women and people have other you know orientation as people who live in the same places as citizens I think it's that conversation about blowing up masses rather than you know keep emphasizing all the differences in saying that somehow\nWe can imagine some sort of utopia without no distinctions all or we'd have differences in in in roles whatsoever I'm according for liberal extremism what type of ... an hour remark what I'm calling for as a society that recognizes people for the different roles and talents implications\nEnded affords public you know dignity to everyone and dignity means being respected fool the source of roles you've played for the relationships you have not being forced into warm identity when to just being a inoculation vigil\nPriya very briefly ... is that the world your championing hyper liberal one where everybody that goes back into the separate digested\nHardly I don't think anything on sets today has um attended in that direction and in fact I've I've no idea who these mystical people are hoping claiming this I think what we need to be looking at quite simply it's who has wealth and power and who is in fact inflicting suffering and\nExploitation on all the people and focus on that an off the real questions instead of having a false debate about how people who want to be able to use women's boxing is let's say are uh you know a responsible for the rise of racism I think that's just a\nA a really kind of a surreal discussion that we have sometimes at the expense of looking at actuality as ... as\nWell as a novelist and they'd person\nUm I get concerned that the identity politics in much like that just that last comment is now trapping us into a world where we think all that matters is human hierarchy that that's the only conversation we ever have identity politics has been very concerned of course with\nWho's privileged who's on top who's been more disadvantaged\nYou know life and the world\nAre bigger than that and I don't want to live in that in that space I Want to be able to talk about architecture\n[noise] I don't that thoughts that's it for this week on the real story Lionel Shriver\n...

nine percent of valid sites and for them to her dad will take forty one percent so it ... the news really\nOn how would you assess the way the campaign has unfolded since that first round took place\nI think it's become much more brutal rate it's become intense I think everybody expected it become more intense because it was a it's a runoff between two candidates who really polarized Brazil but\nI mean the last few days that have been accusations that the right has been getting it and the legal helping hand from resilient and put us that basically being funding a campaign ... ... ... with fake news about another had died and this is being an issue throughout the campaign so much of that campaign is being through social media\nThree ... and it says you need it you can really get

do we bring things together again off towards if we win\n... his campaign had been based on bringing together that it's one Brazil that won't count that goes against\nThat some of his narrative way he's made sexist racist comments but his campaign is being by much about one Brazil and I mean both men have been talking about how they want to move Brazil forward but when you have the attacks from the other side than you know that they've campaign promises picked apart and not that they can sign\nIt how how does move forward when you do have sought to a divided population I mean he stayed with Indians and no one really likes to talk about politics here or there are so many families who fall and outside of the issue if you vote for one side or the other I mean ... fat groups\nEverybody just despise really affecting family members whichever side that brought it said tense time here in Brazil\nWon of direct debates between the two candidates at any point has that happened to do\n[laughter] well that's the thing is that with Dr Olsen are becoming stronger and stronger he's become mole\nIntent on or not taking thought he cited medical reasons why he ... he was stabbed in a campaign right about them several months ago and he cited that as a reason why he wouldn't get to take part in debates I think it'd be signed off now he's he's able to take part in them but he\nHe doesn't he does Facebook lives talks to have supported\nAnd I think it is it a lot of people because they feel that they should say that discussion between the two men had died has even said that he'd go to the wards have these debates but nevertheless the Manhattan debated and we just have a friend both scenarios through his face that lives in talking to his fans that way and it seems to\nBe a painting to have

which you might see coming in very soon after he celebrates that victory\nNo I think that the issue is that he talks a lot he talks the talk that people want to hear about changing for sale about

who refers back to the minute tree jump to Brazil a relatively warm but he yes he looks as if he's going to win by a landslide\nWhile I think is what's going on in Brazil by the sound of it is exactly what some thing on them much with the rest of the world um it's the rise of a populism I'm sort of nationalist populism with a strong um sense of\nOr wearing the same boat I mean by that that we are old fighting against puppy for the survival of democracy and the rule of law\nWhich returns to the the we started the program where the image and cubby reporting from from some of those who come and take closely on the Brexit negotiations that I look at from just being perhaps the toughest of the twenty seven is that how you see\nI mean I I think it's in a sense that it it it's going to be a tough as it is the closest us geographically and in terms of historical connections that that kind of a love hate if you want to put it in human terms and they shouldn't ship is a is a long one\nBut I I also think that friends is very much constrained by DU I'm In the fantasy that the Tories have that somehow they're going to be negotiating one by one with every member of the year\nIt's actually factually unconstitutional Minecraft so far it hasn't happened then it's not going to happen because of course the biggest countries in the EU with which the u._k. would have to make a deal\nAre also

it does then that the foundation of the European project comes into question they will have\nLots of pushback from other places like Poland for example or another it today and they they can't afford to be seen to be weak\nA three foot from you both on an event that's taking place in the u._k. today specifically in London people voting saying let's have another referendum ... what do you make of that\nWell we have to be careful um I mean you know may sound like a good idea I think unless the there was a very significant\nChange in public opinion um the the pollsters picked up ... um and I know I I mean a big one oh so it becomes a sort of sixty forty I'm pleased with the ... percentage points um\nBreak a in favor of\nOf remaining I think the second referendum could be actually quite dentures and we don't see that sixty four we don't see that and I think you know even if the if there was a second referendum on the remain a would win by say it gives you ... you know fifty to foresee a walk\nOr I think that actually the the consequences of that politically it could be completely disastrous without\nNot equipped filled on that uh there was a very cruel joke a on social media yesterday that maybe all of these delays and the transition period the lengthening the transition period has said that all day I'm ... years with actually dials there'll be a generational

international correspondent leads to say he's on the line from the capital Kabul how do you assess the mood on on voting dailies\nWhat I think it's very difficult to describe a mood across this country because the situation will give her district by district we have reports that\nKind of on her blocking roads and some of the southern provinces to the voters can't reach the polling stations\nBut I've just been out on the streets of Kabul they're quite quiet but on every street corner and around every polling center there is a ring of steel with the police and army I just had to keep this date as safe as they can and I have to tell you I went into one polling station\nThat I have visited every time I've covered elections in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban it was absolutely packed\nIn the women's side there was a crush of women all trying to get in to cast their ballots and on the men's side as well as long queue winding around the school yard\nAnd at the tie him it wasn't really done like that because often it's your country to see it immediately how to fitness figure because fast the skin only turns red and it's a slow process so that's the problem why they didn't act doesn't mean that\nThis was eleven years ago but how much impact did you still have a whole new today\nToday is they they still ... mental queen ... who\nKnows who else he's eleven years I realized that this is a hard and that really will last for your whole life\nAnd it's something that hasn't only affected me actually there are many women in Columbia who have gone through the same it destroys your face but it also has an impact on your identity and the psychological pain is something that's very difficult to overcome\nYou mentioned the number of women in Columbia who have suffered in the same way as you why do you think there is a high number of these kinds of attacks especially on women in Colombia\nAnd think ... yeah they can now go to ... when the space\nI think that in Columbia as well as in other countries this kind of violence happens of learning women with\nChemical agents daily basically it's just a symptom of a cycle of violence that we as women sometimes don't identify as an artist stage and it's linked to a physical but also psychological emotional and economic violence\nThis is something that we feel in a ... culture\nAnd in a moment that we don't expect it can hit us with this form of very extreme violence\nYou founded the organization than survey most to help victims of ISIS attacks like you know what are the Ames what are you trying to achieve by by working for that organizes\n... when ...\nWas born as a\nFoundation to how to survive this need to provide a very comprehensive form of support\nAnd we include a women and men who are victims of violence not only of acid violence but also other forms of violence and that is the distinguishing characteristic of fence their animals\nAnd because of the foundation stone half this inclusive approach\nThere are more than eight hundred women in Columbia who've been affected by acid violence\nAnd our aim is to make the stone to publicize this and the world and to work on prevention and particularly to ensure that this kind of violence won't affect any more women in Columbia but also in other parts of the world\nMarket show me a little bit about the work that you do in this area will help you trying to provide\nI'm a psychologist I work with survivors in order to give them comprehensive as a sense I care understanding mental health is a part of well being in a lot of other areas\nUnderstanding the connection between the possibility to access to justice to war to education to support for their families in order to be healthy mentally and physically\nBecause presumably the psychological impact of something like this you are left wondering why it happened you're left wondering about the people who did each\nAnd your left having to get used to the fact that if you look and feel different\nExactly the psychological impacts are as strong as the physical impacts they're not that simple but they are there and\nThis is actually one of the areas that is neglected by a lot of the services that they can access to in Colombia we already have a very good service for physical health but a lot of times the follow up for their families\nAnd for them it's not available or it takes\nToo long for them to access to and they're alone in that so we sort of help them to not be alone to understand that\nThis has happened to other women and that they can also talk to other woman to recover and to feel like they can take control under live than transform their lives embracing what happened and understanding it in a very different way\nMontgomery Joe Rodriguez or psychologists with events or a most organization in Columbia prevents already most he's cofounded Patricia ... interpreter Irina Munoz by highlighting that kind of issue that I can make a difference\nI think it does and I think it is really quite important but it's also quite important to recognize that a lot of the current uh attack by often young men against women world over in various forms and\nThen in North America they take a gun and they go on mass shootings raised in India their rights are and happened across different casts and\nAnd of course acid attacks is something that we see in Pakistan and in here and on and on and in Columbia as well and I and I think that that is part of the backlash against the rise of\nA women's activism more visibility by women\nIs inevitable that women's activism and patriarchal cultures which is just about everywhere in the world is going to generate this kind of punishment mentioned the ... out of your collateral you think that's a big factor I think it's a big factor it's been a factor everywhere patriarchy exists everywhere but I\nThink that in countries also that have undergone some sort of violence trauma or there's some sort of an economic break down this form of backlash becomes that much more intensified\nCody what are your thoughts [noise] oh yeah well this is obviously completely horrific um [noise]\nI I agree I haven't talked about the um aspect that's actually very interesting um but it is a backlash um I think the mole yes I think the more visibility\nUm give us I'm the bus or a really and it needs

been raped and other ... instances not seeing somebody who's been saying that that I think that's the role of the activists say going on of course they do so at great risk to themselves but I think that's that's what's so admirable about a lot of these\nI think that also survival I mean in a way it's incredibly brave was\nThe victims do but it's also a coping mechanism to survival it's it gives

original slide reviewed had found so they reviewed over ... cases\nThat old has had essentially been done for educational purposes and as well as well intentioned but very poorly managed so women weren't told their slides had been reviewed\nAnd critically that didn't certainly two hundred and Twenty one cases they might have benefited from an earlier a diagnosis or a different intervention so that's an issue of group of two hundred and Twenty one women are families were identified\nBy the health service we now know that twenty women have died but we don't know the cause of death in all cases\nSome women died without ever knowing about this all just\nCervical check had told some doctors that several women shouldn't be told that the false negative results have been identified in ...\nThere was a dispute of sorts between cervical check headquarters in Dublin and doctors and hospitals around the country at the who should actually have responsibility pretending to women doctors who would not being involved in this all this\nSome of them didn't feed it was their job to be telling women that perhaps mistakes have been made by others but not by them\nSo it was the reason that they all knew by then that they had cancer that time it cost and time it moved on said those abnormal cells that are being seen on the initial Smith ...\nYes I mean that that's correct also the way some women were told is also an issue the subsequent inquiry found there'd be an uh what they said was a ... paternalistic culture by conditions\nThat some doctors told patients of the issue in a very

these drugs uh one part of the solution but we also need to make sure that they get to the right people need it\nA hundred million people are at risk of Republicans however the drugs are only getting about a hundred and fifty million people at the moment so what needs to also happens is significant expansion of those I knew it was being given to people to help treat this disease\nThanks for that James Madison new research on the curious link between obesity and ask that changes the known for some time that people who are obese seemed to have an increased risk of developing asthma why is that\nWell I don't have a really simple for your call you I mean some of them might be down to the weights and caring stuff that's in the way the lungs work other ideas surround the immune system information caused by obesity\nAnd how that impacts the lungs but there's also discussion around with a suitcase or just being missed diagnosis and the first place and this other breathing problems caused by white but it just presenting as having symptoms like aspirin so I Know ... because of the best one\nWell now a new study conducted in children and nine European countries has found it can also happened the other way round the children with asthma are more likely to put on weight needed Chauncey associate professor of preventative medicine at the University of Southern California has followed twenty thousand children who want to be to start with\nAnd monitored that weight and in Aspen symptoms until the age of eight\nWhat we found was that children diagnosed with asthma everyday life of the age of three to four years before school and say how about six to six percent higher risk of becoming obese compared to those with ...\nAnd the reason course my tier for the children who had octave asked for the children who have been diagnosed with asthma and who had octave symptoms\nAnd why am I to be that children might have ... and then become obese after that what could link they\nYes so the ... direction between us men obesity is not very well understood\nWe know that ... is a ... a DVD\nAnd that might lead to accumulate and I was talking about the another reason is that children are we'd see we're a smile on our own high doses surfing handle it gone through Coursera international medication and these mitigation has also been hypothesized to increase the risk of obesity being chosen\nAnd specifically for this hypothesis our started going from the children and we saw Smith who use mitigation how strong your risk of developing obesity\nSo it could be that it that it's the medication that's contributing to that it's hard to know what to do about that isn't it because they need to take the medication over to not have the aspirin chat\nWhile we're in you need to know if ... and I did good treatment of fast my kind of use it to ... to ...\nAnd we can expand our knowledge of that but they both ways leading us not to obesity and if we have enough information than we can better targeting generation for my children for example dated interventions ... died due to part they're reaching the off she dumps out just for example and indeed uranium diet pattern\nOr physical like DVD interventions and we can uh let's say advise the parents and the families with ... children and their physicians on how to help us not the job done to grow up and to prevent the obesity epidemic and his children\nIs it possible that as something else going on and that's the same children who have asthma or so I'm more likely to be a base and that is that some other reasons some other association getting home\nYes I mean in terms of the biological mechanisms we know for example the most prominent biological mechanisms to explain the observer ... any systemic inflammation\nWe know that the alterations in Libby metabolism ordering got micro by on that and also go among pathogenic mechanism for asthma and obesity\nAnd also we should take into account that the interplay between us men obesity is a vicious cycle because of these children with us now have usually increase symptom medication use an\nAss nexus invasion showing these two conditions are linked very well together and we should understand the cause of direction between them\nSo what do you think needs to happen next to be able to pin down exactly what's happening when do you need to follow people up for it you know twenty is\nYeah we have them going start is with long your follow up and a ... called the ... research project comprised of multiple cohorts in the United states\nAnd in this project we want to replicate these findings because you know the European study is the largest one that we have left now but we know we have to determine let's say whether early onset asthma and other asked my related ... for example to reunite these or an exam I raise the risk of childhood obesity\nAnd also to investigate whether factors like us months if he didn't do or sleep duration ... children no physical activity or should they do to behaviors or diet\nCould modify these associations show off to design the best interventions that is\nNeeded shot see now change before we get it as such out on a new type of calm down which lubricate ... self ultimately so house is different from the normal lubricate she called them\nWell this takes the basically ... out to be

to it and it stays on the surface of the ... that for making it very slippery and new protected\nSo the comes not actually missing anything itself\nYou know missing anything but it's been designed in such a way that it can grab moisture from its surroundings and therefore retain lubrication and the theory is according to the research with the\nTests that that is that it will remain slippery for much longer than either ... or lubricate the Columbus and they think it would last around a thousand for us for about sixteen minutes according to them of sexual performance and that is more than

what they see is not learn to hurricane season is telling us about global warming\nI Would say that these storms that we can expect in the future are going to be stronger they're going to produce higher syringes they're going to cruise more rainfall cause of the warming oceans because of greenhouse gases\nAnd we the demise of acclaim repeated on this program two years ago for evidence of the oldest fossil on the climate\nI still don't cook late in life and all the time they don't have good at and I think they probably want to take that\nWe saw with the end of a great city aren't cool which was one of the wonders of the world from the ... century to the fifteenth now it's just a popular tourist destination deep in the forests of Cambodia\nAnd a UNESCO world heritage site on the subject does much off the logical activity by groups like the great ankle project led by penny and with good reason\nAnd Cole was incredible as a city it was\nThe world's largest in the pre industrial period sprawled over more than a thousand square kilometers in area and was characteristic of a particular kind of low density urbanism which was popping up in the tropical world in the ... the common era an uncle was I think probably the biggest those on the largest city on it at that time\nA thousand square kilometers um but yeah no far off ... London or daily it's today\nYeah that's right to know missed by any standard in in comparison with for example London during the same time period it was a monster of a city and how many people that's an excellent question and effectively unanswerable because we simply don't have the historical fidelity to answer that\nBut the estimates range from seven hundred and fifty thousand up to ... million but again those numbers are very rubbery and it really depends he talked to\nWhat everyone agrees on was they open a gray area and says he was sustained by an enormous sum critical network can miles ultimately the weak point that down penny has been studying\nIt's an interesting system when you look at it\nThe water distribution network achieved several things it was a multifunctional network in Maine that was providing irrigation water to agricultural fields across and we'll say domestic water supply but it also played a role in mitigating flooding\nIn the city so large volumes of water was stored in the ... reservoir some of which were\nSixteen square kilometers in area the single reservoir on and storing many millions of cubic meters of water side of the systems which fed those reservoirs and the canals which captured surface water flow\nWere designed also to mitigate the risk of flooding and what is it very seasonal environment so this is critical infrastructure to the functioning and the flows of the city when I was active\nAnd am I right but what you be looking at is the ... that infrastructure played that in the demise of this extraordinary civilization\nYeah that's right I think we need to make an important distinction here in the sense that we're not talking about the demise of a civilized nation but rather the fragmentation of into the network certainly what we suspected for some time is this very large and very complex system was severely damaged by flooding\nIn the latter part of the fourteenth century and we know that in some way to kill I did with that period of extreme climate variability during the fourteenth fifteenth century\nAnd we have long suspected that the functioning of the critical infrastructure that was represented by this water distribution network was somehow interrupted and that led to sexual outcome that we say and they say the relocation at the Capitol\nI mean it's a very interesting phrase somewhere in your paper about cascading failure so it sounds like some parts of the system was pushed over the edge of men they bought ... it'll ...\nYeah I think the cascade is critical to the document and that's what we saw determine precisely whether they would be a cascading this system given certain conditions and we are all very familiar with these things as we experience them is blackouts in various infrastructure networks that we rely on his part of a ... and lives\nAnd so effectively the argument here is that you can have a very small disruption to one component of the system which can then propagate out very rapidly to create a much larger outage that maybe network wide or at least ... minute we're effectively compromising its core function\nSo you're saying it's a bit like when the electric power system goes down it might be just one link that goes down and then it brings arrest and you'll say one Lincoln this\nCanal network march of gone then others followed\nYeah to exactly right and it's precisely like a power outages the very small disruption which might be simple as and I've lived in a switching station somewhere can actually create a problem which may be much much much larger and more significant\nSo he said that there was an overload of some ... related to these monsoons\nYeah precisely said the I've been talking about in the system is not an electrical obviously but it relates to a period of a particularly wet monsoons during the latter part of the fourteenth and nearly Fifteen centuries which sits between two very large in prolonged drought so this is a period of\nQuite dramatic climatic instability so the evidence that the damage created by these floods this overload as you say is very clear and the landscape very easily measured what we wanted to know was does that damage create a cascade with tech have this entire system and I'm\nJust sort of try and work out how it would do what would the failure of one come out have a sense of the whole network of canals\nYeah it's an interesting question that relates to a feedback betraying erosion which you might expect in a flood situation and said imitation which you might not necessarily expect so al model\nEstimated the dynamics of erosion and said I'm In ... in these canals systems given a sitting magnitude of flooding what we found was if you're putting more water down a canal which is not designed for it\nYou will trigger incision and that's precisely what we say in the reminds of the network has single canal\nOr writing down into its paid several nations in doing so begins to style of flow from other parts of it with you and of course ... there's a feedback between erosion and sediment patient in a concentration of flow into a single pathway through the network\nEffectively stopping most of the network of water a day by fracturing the system breaking it into a smoke compliance which are no longer functioning\nI think it's pretty amazing that this cascade of events could bring to its knees this great just sit on the climate\nAnd indeed and it's an interesting question whether this was the act that caused that shift from encore to the cycle middle period cities closer to load and capital of no pin\nOr whether this was simply the final event mocking the end of a city which was becoming increasingly unwieldy and increasingly irreparable so it's an interesting question whether this was the ... or whether it was simply that the event that broke a system there was no longer being maintained\nThen penny from the University of Sydney his analysis of ... this week in science advances the small Web page at BBC World service dot com\nMaintaining critical infrastructure is a bit of a theme this week health is critical to modern society that into depends on access to effective antibiotics to treat the infection\nRipple from the bureau of investigative journalism since that\nCritical infrastructure is being undermined by ones and use

sided emblem they wanted some marketing materials for this new country they just formed and anyway the three top of the design and Congress doesn't like it they rejected they come up with another design by\nBut Franklin in the ... and that process came up with three words that Congress did like and those three words were\nLatin words ... he took those words not for like great Roman thinker but rather from like a magazine he liked it called gentleman's magazine\nIt was a literary magazine and on the cover where these words he pluribus unum\nOut of many one and what they were trying to say in the in the magazine was out of many fragments of literary works one magazine where he he he saw it as out of many states in people's one nation and and I think what he understood ... really very early was that diversity difference created great strengths of the country\nBut what was going to create that unity it was going to be our belief\nA common belief in democratic self governance\nSo as we look at conflict I think it's maybe a fool's errand to try to suppress conflict the question is do we have enough in common to hold it together\n\nBecause scientists have noticed that both parties are becoming more ideologically consistent in other words Republicans are more conservative and Democrats are more liberal than they used to be I asked David if this kind of polarization might be leading to destructive conflict\nLook we don't know if I Want to be careful history I'm a history and I look back where it I'm not so good at predicting the future and I think none of us are so we don't know if this type of conflict is itself dangerous I guess I'm I'm not convinced that it is I think a much bigger concern and if you look at for example Gallup asked this question on a regular basis\nIt if you ask do you have confidence in your fellow Americans to make decisions as part of our democracy actually that number has been falling\nUp quite dramatically and the number who say that they have little or no confidence and their fellow Americans has increased sharply from that Fifteen Percent in the early Nineteen Seventy ... about forty three percent today\nThose are those are big numbers I have to say I worry much more about those numbers than ideological conformity and someone that I think the question is do you have some faith in those around you even if you disagree with them sharply do you believe\nIn the system are you willing when you lose to accept it and are you going to be treated with some degree of respect when you lose as well you know as we think about winning and losing we have to lose with grace and we have to win with grace as well and maybe we just have to be careful not to let the winning and losing become a value of its own\nI'm Wondering as you're thinking about the long sweep of history it's clear there have been many many many examples where things look like they're falling apart and they have it and the case you make as a result is that the country's resilient\nBut I'm Wondering if this belief and resilience can hide the fact that sometimes actually we might be addressed in other words it's only in hindsight that you know there are certain things turned out when or badly in the moment how do you know which way it's going to go right so I think you need to look at\nIs the culture of democracy strong enough to hold us together that's the question I keep asking how do you know you need to look at your politicians look at the ones on your side\nWho agree with you and do you see them ever putting democracy in second place\nAnd how often do they do it all so\nI'll leave it to listeners to to make that decision my guess is you can find some examples of that and you can find examples in history the more severe that becomes the more dangerous it becomes\nIt's good I think in a democracy to be hypochondriacs that is to think that oh our system might be second because when you think it might be sick he starts to take some action\nOne of the factors you identify that's different about partisanship today from boxes and chip in the past is that you see partisanship in the past was more ... what do you mean by an exuberant partisanship and how could we bring that back\nSo as you say I think if you if you go back into the nineteenth century partisanship was extremely extremely strong but if there was a there was a ... a life in it and excitement and that came out for example beautifully\nOn election day election day was a celebration it was a party that was completely different from election day today what do I mean by that well back that actually voting was public\nYou would go and cast a ballot your ballot usually had a caller might be panic it might be blew 'em and it would reflect what party or voting for everyone could see when you put the ballot and [noise] and\nThere were a lot of people around you in fact usually you're voting at the ... voting place there was a celebration going on there was a lot of uh debating there was a lot of drinking there was a lot of fighting there was a lot going on overall the voting rights were up at Seventy Seventy five eighty percent or so very high voting rights much higher than we have today\nSo there was this celebratory atmosphere was going on at every election and part of that was something we wouldn't want to repeat so uh you know why we're a ballot so public why was voting so public well part of it was political machines wanted to be able to pay people off to vote for their party [noise]\nAnd you couldn't really pay people off if you couldn't see how they were going to vote so if you're going to pay them a dollar to vote this way or that you had to make sure you knew um how they're actually gonna vote so you had to see you had to have someone at the polling place watch them I put the put the vote and so there was a downside there was a corruption associated with the with the solar system\nBut unfortunately when we fix that we ended up taking the life out of voting\nAnd now most people do they vote they vote in a private booth and they make their decision they walk out maybe by a brownie to bake sale or something and that's about it\nBut there is a question could we have a little bit more of that celebrate tore atmosphere could election day B a B holiday could it be more of a celebration and what you see is a lot more people engaged in the democracy\n... so we got a cleaner electoral system ... wouldn't want to give that up but boy we lost something in the process of\n[noise]\nDavid mom is the author of democracy a case

[noise]\nThat many of the western countries are looking to the United states for leadership on how all of the countries the western countries if you will should respond but my sense is that we collectively a need to figure out a way to do that and that that entails conversations between us we all have some or\nIf you will and trust in Saudi Arabia I don't know that I can give you a specific answer I Know that uh I'm committed to working with their state palm pale and others to figure out\nPeople on the other side of the ... Senate to figure out the appropriate way forward and we need to be thoughtful about it I mean we need to we\nNeed to realize that uh you know Saudi Arabia is a very unusual place none of us have a lot of insight into who the next later might be a if in fact NBS is not the leader so this is one of those things where again we don't want or none of us need to react with pure emotion\nOr we need to think this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way and we're doing it in a way that is thoughtful but look I think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nSo are you suggesting the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mind should be sanctioned in some kind of way by the United states by the international community\nWhile I mean that's certainly something uh that needs to be on the table and then the question is does he continue to be the leader of the country or not\nIf he continues to be the leader of the country again uh you gotta look at who I let me just digress for a moment and say you got to think about who's next in\nWater they like what are their characteristics um but back to NBS if he continues to be the leader of the country than we might look at things that might deal with the country at large\nBecause the leader of the country himself as committed this crime if in fact that turns out to be the case so\nAgain I think we've got a little time I know everybody wants to fast forward to what is it we're gonna do I know that the United kingdom has backwards and you know they've got a quick meant that they plan to sell to Saudi Arabia the United states is the same place\nOther countries are also uh I think let's let a few days go by maybe a week or two let's get our heads together ah once we know exactly what has happened and figure that out but but all the things you mentioned\nShould be on the table but let's make sure that we're carrying out a policy that takes us to a good place if he's going to be the leader of the country regardless of what happened for the next forty or fifty years and that creates a scenario that all of us need to think through very wisely\nTo that extent do think western governments weapon ... too quick to embrace the crown prince Mohammed bin some man and a\nWrong to believe that he was a reformist\nKnow if you sit with him and I'm sure you've done that
