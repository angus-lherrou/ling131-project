mean because you took about ... what can you can follow the capital the divine right well I've been on just a basically saying but people shouldn't Jews is brought up\nRight well I mean they I mean I have to say that that story made it out a little rate but I have to say that I agree that people have we reached a tipping point and they use of our technology and that people are seeking some sort of\nUm rebalance in that um and so what they're doing is saying to their nannies week you know you actually can't use your phone I Would say that you know there should be some um leniency in that it sounds like they're being a little strict but I think the idea behind it is that\nOur kids today all they see is that our um the people around them their parents that people who love them the people they spend time with\nHave their noses buried in their phones and they're not paying attention to them anymore so I think there is some value in it and our national they haven't plugging\nIs about that balance and really having the conversation about where the balance it so they may have gone a little too far in having these contracts but I Do think that there needs to be a conversation about the use of technology\nWhat will you said it kind of the parents is William I'm I'm presenting with the Harlem due due to the parents will go in those is buried in the day you're going to stop using their friends as well do they have some contracts\nWell I mean I didn't see that in the story and I think that is an ... that's absolutely a problem I mean we see this all the time I'm\nWith parents you know restricting their kids use but they think nothing of that plan out their phones 'em and you know while they're kept trying to get their attention they're on their own and really were the

know don't do it I watched him cooks and the other day the gym blogs as well which are just so beautiful ... well\nI I I really think I mean I Do think that you know that's not realistic and that that technology has a lot of benefits but it's about finding that balance and being mindful of our of your youth and that's really what the national day of unplugging is about certain devalue causing\nThank you very much for talking the surface of from some ... ... should be open plugging drink as good as we make things\nBecause of the book will do for us bought fraud he bought for all

the rabbi of tree of life said similarly but he's welcome to come and I don't want to get involved at this point in the politics of it I like stick to what we can do as a community\nOr talk to kids some principle of the schools are teenagers a rabbi in a synagogue\nAnd my message is like my messages life my message is kindness\nAnd we've seen an outpouring of that from the broader picture

about the importance of showing solidarity a showing what a horrific incident that says I just don't think that this president is really the right president to do it I Know\nHistorically the president has some time served as console or in chief but\nIt's very difficult for President Trump in specific to serve in that role physically with the Jewish community specifically involving a shooting considering\nThat he has a history of using spiteful and dangerous rhetoric against immigrants Jews by and large are an immigrant community that ... and the shooter typically targeted the Jews at the service that tree of life\nSynagogue because they had hosted a national shut bought for immigrants the week before\nThis is a president who has created an aggressive\nAnd harsh rhetoric that has the

speaking out of both sides of his mouth\nAnd trying to console us while\nProbably yesterday or tomorrow saying something that will only inflamed the situation\n... bloom what do you say to that point that\nYou cool down which is obviously everybody's coding out the evil of anti Semitism but\nThose feelings of divisiveness I'm being told her rooms summer on during the that's being ... in part by what's coming out to the White House\nYou know so I find that a moment like this I Want to reiterate I Want to share with you that yesterday I took our seven Detroit twelfth grade boys and girls and boys and we\nWalked over to the a tree of life synagogue we stood right in front of the hour we locked arms with a police officer is the first responders the mayor and we pray together\nAnd it was very powerful for the students and for everyone who participated\nAnd I I feel that at this moment when we have this discussion about President Trump um then we sort of lose track or lose focus\nOn what we should be spending our energy and at this moment I think we need to bring him into the encourage him to speak out more and more against anti Semitism I think there's room later on to have discussions and how to stop these things\nRobert Goodman isn't there an argument that if you disagree with some of the rhetoric that President Trump will those in the this administration using what you should do especially at a moment like this\nIs to engage and to try if if you're saying that rhetoric is hurtful to try and change that\nI mean that's a that's a valid point\nThink with any political official it's important to be able as an American citizen I'm as a religious community to express our beliefs in our will\nMy experience over the last two and a half years with President Trump is that he's not a very good listener and to rabbi Rosen bums point he mentioned something about you know taking the focus off of\nPresident Trump and making it more about you know anti Semitism my experience and my understanding and might read of our president is that it's always about President Trump that he locate some self at the center of every fire storm\nAnd creates more tension and anxiety for the community\nThere are times as a Jewish community when we need to take a stand against violent rhetoric that exacerbate the situation this is a president who couldn't even bring himself last year to properly condemn a Nazi march in Charlottesville which ended in the death of a young woman\nBut rather said quote that blame exist on both side there are times that the Jewish community
