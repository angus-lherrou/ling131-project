folks and the response to the crisis and ask if the way the government's handled it make things better or worse [noise]\nThey're not saying Hey Nate same hunting the way we have [noise]\nIn the u._s. it's estimated that the crisis cost at least twenty thousand dollars for each person\nAnd overtime results in the loss of Fifteen billion dollars of national wealth equivalent to almost one year's economic activity the greatest pain is being felt in the old industrial cities in small towns where there's a great concentration of homes affected by the collapse in the mortgage market\nJeff Smith executive director of the Institute of housing studies in Chicago explains\nThe way that the foreclosure crisis in the financial crisis affected housing markets in the states is that it really started to most heavily impact neighborhoods where you had a high concentration\nOf subprime loans and you had a lot of families being evicted from their homes due to foreclosure you had a lot of vacancy in abandoned meant in those neighborhoods and it was really concentrated you know a lot of urban or an African American neighborhoods in cities and suburbs across the country\nSo in Chicago you got some neighborhoods where over forty percent of the housing units in those neighborhoods were hit by at least one foreclosure over the foreclosure crisis the house itself\nWas likely abandoned and overvalued so in many cases the value of the mortgage was much greater than the actual value of the property causing blight in many neighborhoods in Chicago and other parts of the country\nI also Jeff what happened to these people foreclosure\nIs a negative event on your credit score credit scores are very you know significant numbers of these days and when lots of people make decisions on not just if you can get a loan\nOr for a car or for mortgage for a credit card but also use if you can get a job you use if you can get a apartments\nSo it was a big event that hill a significant effect not just on where they live but also options going forward\nIn the U.S the crisis has skewed home ownership to older borrows with strong credit ratings homeownership rates will be under forty five have sued sharply since the crash\nOver forty percent of housing wealth is now held by over sixties compared to own your closest before the crash poor and middle income families and young people have not benefited from increasing housing values in recent years\nJust highlights the extent to which the diverging fortunes of the property market led to increased inequality\nThe economy at least for certain components of the economy has improved\nAnd you see investments coming into the city but that's really only touching maybe a third to half of of the city neighborhoods and the rest of the city is\nContinuing to struggle and really hasn't recovered from the financial crisis the neighborhoods still lack investments the families who live there struggle for finding employment and Ford will housing\nSo I think what you've seen in Chicago and yet I think what you've seen it a lot of cities is growing tale of two cities where the fortunes of the rich and the folks who have resources have been getting a better on the fortunes of the folks who\nAre struggling and are getting worse\nThe growing inability of low income people to sell their homes and move the dynamic cities with a new job

for economics explains the reasons\nA economy is hit by a crisis economy goes down tax revenues go down often expenditures have to go out for unemployment welfare benefits\nAnd so even countries with surpluses wind up having deficits and even more if you have to spend a lot of money to bail out the banks\nHistorically there have been many instances where government seeing that deficit\nSay that deficit will result in a loss of confidence we have to get rid of the deficit that way you get rid of the deficit is cut back expenditures which is called us therapy or raise taxes but that's really hard to do the middle of a downturn\nHerbert Hoover who was the president when the stock market collapsed in Nineteen twenty nine\nUsed austerity and I credit him with converting the stock market

least ... trillion\nKing's great work address the question\nWas should have been done and the answer is not austerity but stimulation what happens in the economic downturn is people get fearful their spending and except vicious cycle is that now spend the economy gets weaker\nAnd austerity is a downward spiral\nIn Nineteen twenty nine governments acted like people and when times got tough they\nReduce spending but while it's rational for people to tighten their belts in tough economic times came showed that if governments did the same they wouldn't make matches far worse\nAnd the government's needs to overcome fear and economic contraction by spending to reignite the moms\n\nIn Europe and the u._k. like in the U.

Newsday it's coming up to a quarter past the ... that is one of the top stories climate scientists are saying politicians in society must take immediate and far reaching action\nAs well to prevent a dangerous rise in global temperatures a that's a big story too and um we are going to now actually go to a headline was just from China investigating the former head of into ... they say for corruption and accepting bribes\nAnd then of course after days of speculation about what might have happened to the head of the local law enforcement organization named hung way who is also the Chinese vice minister for security was reporting missing last month\nAfter traveling from France were Interpol is faced to China and on Sunday as Lawrence was saying there and headline Chinese authorities\nBroke their silence to announce that Mr Mann\nWas under investigation by the country's anti corruption body for more I spoke to our correspondent in Beijing John somewhere\nKnow nothing up for among the way he himself a only a these are very scant details at all now emerging from the Chinese authorities the confirmation or that he is indeed being held here in China he wrote a ton of course\nFrom ... from sweating to his base to China at the beginning of last week a he was reported missing a last night we got the confirmation from the Chinese authorities that they are holding him I I we have also now are being told not that he is suspected of\nA law breaking and in in particular that are of taking\nBribes and I think what's notable shined ... is that the and now all these announcements have not come from a you know ... from a court buddies or ... or from a national prosecutors they have come from Communist Party organs at a particular dish the central commissions a disciplinary inspection\nThis is my story is shall we internal policy bought he talks with taking on China's fight against corruption and that would have cost raise concerns about if nothing else due process of calls\nAnd it it's almost as if the Communist Party saying well you wanted to know what his whereabouts you wanted to know what happened to him here's what happened to him he's being accused of that you know just to put some more information out there for people who are saying well where is he yes\nI I think China would have felt the pressure I mean you know when to pull is an organization that I'm specializes I suppose you could say in in tracking missing people across borders suspects in in criminal cases\nYou know he was this extraordinary situation in which it has lost its own prisons and I was a crazy demanding answers from the Chinese authorities so I think you're right they feel they feel compelled\nTo give them the difficulty of course is that um it it looks like Mr among has disappeared into a ... a ... a Communist Party controlled pro says he's not the first senior official to be called shopping these anti\nUh in these sort of corruption allegations is politics Xi Jinping's anti corruption drive or whether we couldn't have a judge 'em you know the case against him is a is a difficult question that's the point of a one party system of course there is no independent judicial read the news a political process\nI think uh you know China will play you of course as it has with other senior officials in some of the things we can already see elements of this it will claim that uh this case like this proves\nThat nobody's above the law\nOr critics would say of course it proves that nobody is safe\nJohn some words from they gene there just to know Mr ... name has now stepped down with immediate effect from Interpol\nUm of course into bull does have a missing persons page on its Web sites and these ... mentioned all messed up because we know where he is Eighteen minutes ... these must be kept him\nKilling in Boston I said he should've scored more goals even though he got full for parents aren't your mind said we live on five nailed to go to a record nine ... to ... ...\n... do the outer admitted he didn't know that ...

Zimbabweans not to panic buy fuel and other basic commodities it comes off of the finance minister issued a warning that there is going to be economic pain had\nLots of course along with the economic pain behind them or the government is trying to bring about some economic recovery or it's going to squeeze the newness is here from a business desk um it's not suddenly looking in such bad shape is it but what all the problems\nNo it's not suddenly it's just that it seems to have come to the full and the last few days the number of existing problems as you say one of the huge national debt ... has it's now nearly seven ... billion dollars in the red and not a long standing problem is that\nLots of difficulties when it comes to accessing foreign currency that a severe shortage of Martin

dictatorship of general Franco BBC News [noise]\nNone of the challenges of all the troubles and complex will bloom so law\nIs climate change climate change these upon us climate change is one of the major issue off all the time every wanting\nTo shrink gays to this year we've seen good reasons for them to be so\nI Want to talk about the European heat wave the wildfires have problems with the heat so extreme weather the climate vote even politicians understand you can't read too much into a one on one year of my friends with the Eighteen we've seen continental scale heat waves soup atomic foods\nThese thinking much rain falling off a day I usually would end in ...\nIs the face of climate change indeed that's where the rubber hits the road fourteen of the Fifteen warmest years on record federal on in the first years of the century twenty Eighteen has now joined those ranks [laughter] it's not the top maybe for the weather we've seen seems to point to what to expect in the future\nEspecially if we don't do anything about food so bomb is talking about\nThe global warming and that is a lot of it's a hoax some in some money making industry okay\nBut with the Carolinas counting the cost of Hurricane Florence last month not to mention the burning of reading in northern California the money seems to be moving the all the way\nOne hundred and Seventy five\nHas the raging Saturday\nClimate changes quite simply existential ... most life on the planet and specially the life of human guy [noise]\nTwenty eight teams certainly seems to be showing how it's no climate change at least not climate change alone he's the extreme weather that seems to come along with it many of us have lived these past few months\nBut that raises two issues which I'm going to address in this edition of discovery from the b._b._c. on wrote a piece\nFirst how shall can we be that climate change brought about by C. O. two increases is driving the extreme weather and sick and he says something about the way climate change was that does more than merely adjunct worse whether by increments\nThat second one will take us to the Arctic which could be locking us into patents have drowned them then huge like we've seen this summer the ... takes us to the new science of where the attribution as practiced by climate scientists like Oxford University Freddie also looking for the links between climate change and extreme weather\nWhat education brings is basically it's bringing climate change home where people is\nThe case while global mean temperature is a very good measure of climate change\nIt is not what kills you how climate change many tests is through changing extreme weather events and so with education\nWe can show which extreme weather events that people have experience and you can say is climate change really a game changer here and it still by how much\nBut that also extreme events that are not made more likely\nMean extremes are just part of the climate system they're part of the weather too they happen naturally but they're sometimes is a human induced effect on that and we want to be able to parse out what his natural from what his anthropogenic\nA very extreme and that is unique say you will never be able to say that an event was just caused by climate change I Would have an impulsive without planning to change how ... we can say is how the likelihood of an event occurring is changing the cause of climate change\nTiring this exercise is more ... of picks the ... Institute for climate impact research who twenty twelve co authored a study looking at the previous decade of extreme weather events including the European heat wave of two thousand and three still something of a climate milestone\nAnd the scorching rushing somewhat of twenty ten\nI guess around twenty ... twenty eleven I guess climate scientists more and more\nWorried about links between climate change and extreme weather and actually that's where we're already seeing changes in extreme weather you know with with one of his papacy contributed to that discussion actually showing that especially heat waves but also after rainfall events are strongly increasing due to climate change\nAnd that this is already a mini detectable observational data we have\nAnd it was just a few years find so I didn't lose the type of seems well timed\nThe ... cold temperatures above and sing in recent climate history and this year is set to join them\nAlong scientists global highs a host of weather records to and this year analysts like Freddie also ... to them as they happen ... outfit willed with attribution examines the European heat wave focusing on seven European cities including doubling you ...\nIf you want to find out what the role of climate change in that heat wave days and to what extent it has been made more likely or less likely you need to find out how likely is the heat wave that is happening in the well we live in today and so for example in Dublin it's about one in seven years and then\nAnd then we ask what what the likelihood of this heat wave occurring me and it well without end to the climate change and then the case of dabbling ... it's now with the climate change about twice as likely as would have been laid out and getting a climate change\nWhereas for example in Copenhagen they land was made five times more likely by until they're getting a climate change\nThe story was more complicated in Finland where temperatures of of uh thirty degrees were busting their records they seem surprising and according to the world where the attribution study they're likely to remain that way\nThe further north so in the to finish places we looked at like found that if a much much of it right then in the well we live and say I was in the south than it was at least in one Ninety year then and then the other one it was about a hundred and forty year then\nSo it was a match rare event but we could actually not quantify the effect of climate change because the observations in these places are all over the place and so you're uncertainties are much higher last in this house climate change actually made this a relatively common event\nIs pretty explains the study was based on a mixture of where the dates a climate modeling this is the managing former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system [noise]\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relatives to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from wells explicitly off to the it's finished and\nThen with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen is only now taking shape we won't know what they will make twenty Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the followed up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading\nThe extreme warms across Asia one study said would not have been possible without climate change floods in central trying to the Mets are two hundred and fifty seven and twenty two billion dollars of damage we found to be influenced by global warming\nAnd so one of the things scientists are doing is trying to unravel\nHow much of that is a direct influence of what we're seeing happening in the Arctic\nThis isn't just guesswork that his climate Institute ...\nDidn't ... is leading research that's revealing strong connections between changes in Arctic temperatures in the high level jet stream wins the guide ... much of the northern hemisphere\nWay we talk about the large scale so clay should we talk about things like jet stream and we'll be call storm tracks so the jet stream that's based on by the temperature difference between alone that to go to the shop topics and I like to do what's the what's the object to the optics of cost much colder\nTemperature difference Great Depression difference and that pressure difference flush the jet stream\nThe jet stream owes its existence to that temperature contrast\nMichael Mann has been collaborating with improvement in studying how Arctic warming is changing the north in with our parents and\nThat's actually what creates the jet during this band a very strong winds from the west in the upper part of the atmosphere that trope a sphere that we live in those strong wins arise because of the north south contrast in temperature and if you reduce those contrasts you can slow down the jet stream\nOr you can slow it down what that means that you no longer have that strong jet stream that's there to take those weather systems and move them along so they're more likely to linger\nThis is a study and we have done a couple of years ago and we showed indeed that in summer the jet stream as we go into an particular\nThese storms directs if we can and that is important because these stone strikes have a very moderating effect on the weather conditions over to Europe but in general over in the mid latitudes over the last regions are the reason is nice weather systems are generated\nOver the ocean over the Atlantic a dreadful torched it used to what Europe they have relatively wet Arab relatively mild temperatures and bad for the recording affects on continental temperatures so he sat slow it's weakening\nYou have less of that cooling effect and that's safe for us to build up of hot and dry conditions over the confidence uh this is yeah we've seen quite pronounced changes in that weakening of the weather systems that favors to build up a whole to dry extremes as we've seen for example this year\nBut the weakening has an even more dramatic effect because it is a slap cunning with the wind driven more slowly it's more likely to be diverted and increasingly all with the full cost of our pizza show or launch weedy lines sneaking\nNorth south around the north pole this is the jet stream being pushed around by global conditions and it turned his stealing our weather in more alarming directions\nYou know in one region the jet stream most north what's ranks warm air hopes of topical regions far north Korea it's very warm temperatures region slight Siberia\nAnd at the same time be just where the jet stream been south words it brings in the Arctic all of a self correcting relatively cold conditions so what you tend to see if you have to weigh the jet stream you tend to see\nAlternating are normal nice recall them off warm and cold regions and that's the kind of a very regular pattern around the globe and that that we saw it and do the two thousand I Do\nIn that particular version of the ways the most longest improvement in Michael Mann is called ... treat wave residents when are these ... energy become more and more looked into place the culprit this yeah it did happen\nIt did happen in the summer twenty Eighteen was an example we know this isn't published yet but if you look at whether diagnostics it becomes apparent that this phenomenon of planetary wave residents was playing out and that's why we saw this sort of global coherence it wasn't just\nOne particular region that was seen extreme weather we were seeing it extreme flooding extreme drought extreme heat of course and these are wild fires breaking out in these hot dry areas\nOr around the entire northern hemisphere in that corresponds to the fact that we had very large low pressure systems very large high pressure systems that were basically staying in the same locations day after day it is a classic planetary wave residents set up\nAnd it's not just the heat waves that were affected by the fixed passing the jet stream waves\nWhere there's a high a big high in one place that means downstream there's going to have to be a big low because it's a way because high low high low high low with those peaks and drops and that means that when the western and central us had that big high pressure system the eastern us here in Pennsylvania where I live\nHad this low pressure system that sat there again for weeks on end and it was one of the wettest summers that we've had because we were stuck under one of those lows\nNow here's something else in the eastern us and then the southeastern us where we had\nA tendency for that low pressure system and\nThere was a lot of rainfall and it was really wet and then we got hit by Florence that means the soils we're already saturated and many of these locations from a very wet summer and then all of a sudden you dump a whole lot more rain it's got nowhere to go the soils saturated that means\nYou it's got nowhere to go but to flood the surface which is what we saw\nPlanetree ... is a new plant in the discussion of global warming is not fully incorporated into the models it may not be the game change it currently looks to be research into that will needs to be developed but if they days and Arctic warming is the drawing in the news from the ... good\nWe find it very strong linear relationship between global warming or global CEO to emissions and they see a decline in the Arctic and we see it in summer but we also see it in all of the year that's really strong relationship and what that shows is that there's a really dominant mechanism of\nRadio is warming from increasing the greenhouse gases and that is the overriding factor in terms of a long term trend that see a change in the Arctic\nAnd an hour or two thousand sixteen paper we computer that for every metric tons of the year two that's added to the atmosphere you lose three square meters of the ice and this relationship seems to hold both in the observations but also we see the same kind of linear relationships and Clinton a lot of forecasts\nBut the models tend to be showing a slower rate of sea ice loss per increasing CEO to\nWhich leads us to believe that when we look at our future forecasts of CIA conditions from climate models\nThat there'd be conservative and that actually will probably be seeing an ice free Arctic in summers much sooner than what the motives are forecasting so according to our calculations if this linear relationship or to hold over the next Twenty years we would see an Arctic Ocean that would become ice free first in September\nBut with more to it also is that became the ice free in August in October and sort of extending out from there and we cheer in about Twenty years\nIf this is going to go by indeed and he's the policy is that has to be very alarming\nClimate scientists are currently meeting in Korea to debate what the world might look like if nations do manage to keep average global warming below one point five degrees above\nPre industrial levels an ambitious and probably impossible to get\nWhat we are learning is the worst the weather can throw at us can be more dangerous than we did mentioned\nAnd that the climate is reorganizing itself to amplify those was asked the twenty ninth team will bring our way well that might be a topic for another edition of discovery from the BBC will service but for now for me run and

BBC News\nHello and welcome to business daily from the BBC wouldn't even when I saw that coming up he actually is dying road with a defiant message for the European Union it's all money and we'll spend what we want to\nGo to the movies because it's the right thing to do for our economy that European Commissioner reject or a ... face or the costs of restaurants\nGrown and Brussels looks set to clash of the Italian government spending plans we off what's at stake for the rest of the that's the only business daily from the BBC\nThe European Union is not happy with the new populist Italian government spending program for the next three years it doesn't like Rome's plans to lower the retirement age ... taxes invest in infrastructure and boost welfare why well because all of that will end up adding to its knees already massive public debt\nAnd Eve sets limits on how much the government can spend Italy is already the most indebted countries in the euro is in Moscow beach in the European Commission of economic and financial fast had this to say on CNBC TV a few days ago\nWe started going to tell the truth can be done but he's more of the truth and can make you live for a while but then you end up with a very high debts he says he is the country was inexpensive\nSo we shouldn't be a Jewish voters to thirty because we're not supposed to read the just the two of the defense of the human interest the European interest\nBut Rome is defined it won't budge and ... financial markets with interest actually pays on his government debt going up that's not significantly higher than what Jim and he pays because investors see actually as a bigger risk\nIn a moment what that means for the rest of the year isn't the focus initially the difference between Italian borrowing costs and Jim and borrowing costs is known as ... spread and Italians and follow its ups and downs in the same way that Americans might keep an eye on the Dow Sharon ...\nHas this year I was sitting down and I believe the spread is the difference in in trust between the government boomed recently in Germany\nWhen does it mean to you [laughter] fat despite the between nighttime bonds and Jack ... is very high water in the ...\nSee good yes because all the media shout about the spread so this worry for me comes from the media but to be honest I Can't understand exactly the economic dynamic solve it\nWas spread to ease a lot of these ...\nYes I Believe I Know what the spread is the most famous one is the difference in the value of interest between government bonds essentially centers of Germany I Do worry about ... ... in some ways I'm worried but in others note because\nAs I've seen throughout the years these things have highs and lows but generally this is not a nice thing\nThat are big risks associated with increasing the deficit if we don't succeed it sticking with the parameters of the ... from us that will be sanctions and in the end it will be ordinary people who pay the price so what\nDoes it mean to you when you have the spread between ... is very ... I Do worry about it I learned how to be talking he died yeah and\nWe are so used to they said ... since the ... to be alarmed by the spread there was a time when we talk to that was the spread and that it was the only instruments with which we could measure our economic policies we saw customs\nIn this period to keep an eye on the spread as soon as it rises we get more into debt so I Do worry in a sense that he is an area to pay attention to\nMarket savvy Italians that speaking to try to obtain a in Turin\nMany of them may want to give the new government or the right wing led got an anti establishment five star movement a chance though\nProbably the problem is invested in the European Union I'm nowhere near as keen cloudy above the is the lake parties' economic spokesman I put it into playing the budget deficit initially to to put four percent as his government now plans to do puts Rome on a collision course with the IV in Brussels\nThe actual number is perfect in line with what was the Boston backed off all other major found three said they are they are doing\nBut I think this is the perception is isn't it an and the fact is that for ... you could save France and other countries are given different treatment by the European Union when it comes to exceeding that budget deficits but she has\nA much much larger debt the question is really kind of even a full load these kind of budget deficits that kind of question is not present in other countries\nBut I probably there is something that that that wasn't the way at all because they're running the possibility that that does change though because uh I I was a banking that but there was these uh bring it to this was a sixty percent of their ... and\n... the debt that level should not have to say yes\nSo basically if that really is a bit or that that should not exceed the sixty percent of the well I don't you're going to be trust between when I'm there to strengthen when I'm going to otherwise it'd be a matter of money but I don't know if if not the last of the reason other rules that say you start going through your ... that the ... let's say\nThe sheiks the and the one I'm but I've been saying that they are free to do what they like that so far is it is beyond or when I'm going to end up then you should do procedures or at least ... a barrel damaging\nBack out on me at that point isn't it initially markets I'm not convinced that the economy will grow at a rate that can fund that kind of a debt level that's the issue and that kind of discussion is not present in other countries and other ... countries there are many many more questions about Italian growth\nWhether that if the question you're that young girls that do you think\nThey would be more ... as it was proposed by the previous government that because that pledge of doing a one percent that they can say about ... or was based on it but I'm ...\nSo maybe the grief I pick up on me as if you know and they raised ... boxes a substantial way to think that we're going to go more or less\nMy perception that you thought he probably is going\nReal life so\nYou don't mind your line is basically the tax cuts necessary to stimulate growth well if you will run and so what does that growth that you'll planning in the budget does not materialized surely you must be worried the cable than get into some serious problems when it comes to set a thing it's that\nIs a new servicing of the day the ... is something that you say it's a monster drifted only in Europe because in all the other war the ... and also in the European Union we've gone through that that doesn't have a Europe yeah some of ... ... there is no risk or off or a finance during the day\nProbably there should be restricting the rate of inflation or other kinds of east coast of course I've written about the ... the the risk of the answers to stay out of the market I Know you said\nYou said that at most to actually from this would be sold if it had its own currency but the fact remains it doesn't it is part of the euro being passed the euro involves various pledges\nAnd promises when it comes to spending when it comes to that and that the European Central bank has said it will actually the ... salt they ... said he will do whatever it takes to save the euro but there is this concern out that it's only if everyone's into problems would be just too big to save does that not worrying\nAbout whether we have to understand the ... of the show because a ... as you probably know we are and that's when the thought of the European or basically we are paying the European Union if he doesn't who she was single penny by European Union about the cost of these we have to understand what is good for the economy\nAnd the at the moment the February ... the last thing lying the of the growing on me\nIn Europe but I Would say in the ... the ... and that I don't think that is lost the infamous off the ... show and they don't solve the industry brave though or something that these will have a positive ... but it's so basically\nWe export much more much more ... more than what we\nHave a primary budget so blessed so basically we collect the ducks is much more than what we spend and these numbers is not a section or something at the end of course we have a wonderful county so it's a lot of potential but to do stand with

b._b._c. on the program today a major new report once it without huge changes the impact of climate change will be felt false sooner than previously thought we'll talk to one of the office\nBasically we're saying it's sometime in the twenty five days or twenty four days if the company creative warming continues\nWill say the far right candidate shared above Sinatra winds the first round of Brazil's presidential election the Chinese authorities sort of a head of Interpol is being investigated for alleged corruption and then you play examines the trauma and divisions costs by the Spanish civil war\nYou cannot to carry on ignoring something I think as a civil war sites in that\nPart is the way to actually show the complexities of\nThe issue like that I'm going to bring people together\nThat's coming out of this world me\nWell we ... we put a quite a big range of on south to say on it because there are some unsettling tasted by so you know the rate of increase all of warming basically our best estimate is that it will be around twenty four tea\nIs a emissions continue if temperatures rise that they've come level\nBut we have to ... going to white bond on stepped in Tehran ... basically we're saying at some time and the twenty first taste of twenty four days if the current rate of warming continues\nThe point is that twenty faulty isn't very far away which doesn't leave us much time does it\nKnow there's a very strong message in the report to buy the importance of of uh taking him Egypt action on that if we don't take them agent option if countries don't to increase the level of ... they've already expressed\nTo get a mission is done for the by twenty ... then we will it it becomes the owned challenging to take measures after twenty update\nTo ensure that ... global warming is cut within one point five degrees so very very strong message by your image it Ellie action\nI'm what does it mean in practice how much less fear to do we need to be producing to to to keep it within that limit\nWell we we just saw a fairly dramatic number ... say that carbon dioxide emissions globally we need to fall by about forty five percent by a twenty ... taken by compared to twenty ten rifles or not is just an enormous level of ambition\nWe hops on goods good stories to tell for example progress with renewable energy has been really good over the last ten years we've seen the costs following and we've seen you know the deployment of wind and solar energy going affects financially\nBut what we need to do is take the progress that we've made in renewables\nAnd ... and to other sectors you for example transportation electric vehicles are actually in the in the future you know changed lunge lawns management practices is also going to become extremely important\nIs it technically possible to get that sort of a decrease in the amount of Syria too we produce in so short of the time\nThe scenarios in the electric chair the IT cc is assessed and but just to say the IT see doesn't do its own reception assesses the electric chair and you'll get pushed that the story together\nThere are scenarios I there are so will result in solving less than one point five degrees warming boss to involves these radical kind of changes that you know that we talk about\nThis is an economically possible I'm In the ... well isn't that to people's livelihoods\nTheir calculations I mean there's no summit\nTo a a case of increasing investment but switching investments away from things like investment in also fuel infrastructure\nTowards investment in low carbon renewable energy energy efficiency electric vehicles are cetera\nBut does mean that overall energy investments would need to go off to keep within one point five degrees but it does not look as little as a kind of a show stalk or you know for for economic progress\nCarbon dioxide accumulates and the atmosphere for hundreds of years on we are now living with the consequences over to the taste that previously being taken you used the fossil fuels in the last ... last few decades and even before about\nAnd I think the message we go there it is not too late you know one point five degrees can be done within the laws of physics and chemistry but perhaps the most important point is the political will the kind of institutional changes that might be needed to take up the opportunities that would have like available\nBut that's kind of not for the scientists to do I mean not the message that\nWe've taken to the main audience for the port which is the governments that will be meeting in Poland later this year to take the next step son to the framework convention on climate change\nProfessor gyms ski so does that political will exist Mary Robinson is a former president of Ireland and a former un special envoy on climate change she's also author of a book called climate justice\nBut first of all I think we should acknowledge that it was the climate vulnerable countries the least developed countries ... developed in states who insisted on having one point five degrees Celsius in the Paris Agreement so we have to work towards us\nAnd hence the politicians off the scientists office this mean what's the difference between two degrees at one point five we've never had that before we've never had this kind of a wake up call of how serious it is and how we have to do\nA urgently needs to be done in the next eleven years and so that by twenty thirty were in the right position and\nI you know not only did the ... countries insist and that that would be in the Paris Agreement but they're also the ones that are most ... at the moment the Marshall Islands\nHave made a commitment lost during the U.N General assembly week the time as we can do you look that they published their twenty fifty\nI'm a agenda which includes net zero emissions\nOr Fiji is about to do the same let me put it this way it's the Marshall Islands was on the Security Council this would be the priority it should be and I hope that this report would really encourage a new thinking and new political courage\nBut shouldn't the message ... I'm I'm I'm playing devil's advocate I shouldn't have message be look it's not just about those low lying island states actually this is about everybody and the consequences if the science is right to see the guy that you know thousands of studies\nThen we ... we all have to act in our own interests\nWill absolutely I couldn't agree more other than to using the small islands as having secure are just so we got this good scientific report to show us how serious it\nIs the you know what I'm saying that if they had risen to other people just single actually you know I I'm not going to change my behavior because we're just talking about a few you know ... remote smoke you know under populated on a long way away there's still some concern me\nAnd that's the value of the scientific report it makes it perfectly clear that uh we have only that small window of a lesson years to twenty thirty to make sure that we take the necessary steps and they are ambitious and we do have to move out of ... and into clean energy very quickly and\nIt's really important that we do it\nAnd it will be take the steps we take protect coral communities including their land rights civil rights and already we're seeing some abuses in a clean energy being introduced in with big projects that don't consult with indigenous peoples or a ... or a small community\nAnd from a climate justice point of view this really is the reports we've been waiting for to warn us that's two degrees is dangerous that the we must stay at one point five to have a safe world for our children and grandchildren it's a kind of ...\nThe reason though as far as I can say there isn't the political will to do that at the moment I mean it's it's just not what's being talked about isn't well\nI'm going to king that women worldwide wake up do we want to say for for our children and grandchildren it's urgent us and we have a window of time when we can and should take the measure is necessary and they do is click here from the report their doable but they require\nGreat political will and some of the allergy\n[noise] Mary Robinson former Irish president and the author of climate justice residents in the fight for a

let's discuss a little bit about there's a first round results and what it means for round two let's talk to your book on who's a a correspondence in London for Brazil's a global news and so there will come to the program festival you'll reaction to the result\nOf it I'm not surprised that he came a hit the right wing ... but I'm surprised if the if the level of of domination that he has done this for slow forty six percent is way up ahead of of what the poster predicted that around thirty thirty two percent\nSo that's quite a wave quite a conservative wave along the lines of a right wing achieving power in many countries are just one more yeah so what do you think is driving that\nIn the case of Brazil or several things that the anti corruption feeling in the country is very strong and that is pretty much associated with the with the workers' party which was his main opposition there's the security questions in Brazil has been suffering high levels of\nCrime especially in the big cities you know something like sixty three thousand people were murdered last year this gigantic and when somebody comes around with his background which is a military background\nPromoting hard line on law and order and promote promoting easy solutions to those problems there there's there's quite an appeal to that\nDid for them to do better than expected that\nHe went up as well in relation to the what the posters were indicating beforehand but the one thing we have to keep in mind both candidates have a very high level of rejection in other words people who say I will never vote for one or the other you know depending on what camp there\nAnd the the big question now is where will the voters that went for the other candidates or half a dozen more will vote and the second row\n[laughter] yes and let's talk a little bit about that second round I mean are there enough people opposed to both of those some brand\nOf politics to stop him or his email and unstoppable fools\nI Would say he he's got the so called momentum at the ... it's a wave that is going with the dad would favor him\nBut it's it's still a big question mark on how the others will vote or the people who voted for the other half a dozen candidates how will they split and that as we can see from these numbers most of the NATO needs to just a tiny bit to reach the fifty percent plus one vote\nThat he needs to win outright so in in general I Would say he is he's got a better chance to win a prize\nSo many things to joining us this morning suitable can enter a correspondence among for Brazil's global news we can also talk now to talk to them out to see me Electra in sociology major City University here in London who are\nOn the phone and they don't come out just welcome to the program you'll reaction to the ... do you think that both to do much much better than people expected\nAnd while I was already expecting it so many to watch you know feel has mentioned um there is no surprise in this election in terms of how many votes he has caught and they were just a few things to highlight and it's not possible to include in the right wing for basically\nIt was very much on an extreme right wing on that platform and also they tend to write in in Brazil has access sold\nWeakness that by the pets they end up paying that they have a ten\n... actually with both of these people have proof that they are the main loses in this election so what you have is a kind of strength and Ali aware that it has actually managed to recover from walked\nOff to the criticism and and the ... but to a certain extent it has also not being enough so the big question mark now for the second round is who is going to win obviously I'm from following from what they said yes both an adult\nDoes have a strong good song we can equate him very much within a tradition of rise of leaders and I'm a\n... a somewhat call him like a tropical version of Trump right though the law and order off coming strongly\nAnd and also not because of corruption they because of a sense of a crisis of democratic\nRepresentation yeah a lot of that that the vote is it that way this no politicians\nWere not would you would you characterize him as a fascist dizzy that fall to the right\nOh yes he is he is and uh it's extremely and so basically what we have in the in the last week is the whole world shock to the possibility that he could when\nYou have have easily\nThing not to not true and I think an extreme weight tolerate hatred tolerate such a thing that he would not great\nOn one end and particularly off some of his voters shouting to think that would kill homosexuals he also has a loft and Joe how he would even show to do though\nAnd also other opponents and so it's quite shocking that I'm elements from the center right including some that they have access to enforce a law\nIn relation to and so at that moment there is a big question mark because it's also a lot of movement toward that need to maintain a civilized and democratic representation in the country which is more towards the center and which will not go towards an extreme form the politics of hatred\nAnd I'm totally dismiss it may have of other opponents\nHuh well thank you very much for your analysis was covering them after a mature in sociology\nAt City University here in in London will updates from the BBC [noise]\n\nChina's says that the former head of Interpol who vanished stuffed a returning home to China from from two weeks ago is being investigated for bribery but\nIt's unclear way home way is being held or exactly what he's accused of doing it with me in the studio Michael Briscoe ah Asia Pacific Michael what more do we know\nThe commercials and that we choose and perhaps a lot more than we have you know the cases in China just sat 'em at home wave dissipate a couple of weeks ago he was on a flight back to a homeland from France and where he lives with his wife and child is that what he was he was the head of the Interpol that\nUm and at simply vanished ... on Sunday evening they turn Sunday evening the Chinese authorities indicated that he being investigated now we got a little bit more detail about the bribery charges\nThere was a little bit more set in the press release issued by the public security ministry in China saying that investigation to him was why correct and timely suggesting uh they've already decided he's guilty of those ...\nAlleged crimes what an extraordinary story surely they\nTell us a bit more advanced him how does he fit into the the hierarchy of the Communist Party I mean I'm thinking before he became head of into president Vince ...\nSteve Lopez is a columnist with the Los Angeles times who go to\nRomero over the last Twenty years back in Nineteen Ninety eight his editors at the paper mentioned the thirtieth anniversary of the assassination of Robert Kennedy Lopez remembers they asked him one question\nDo you remember the photo of the ...\nIt was that I kind of photo that ran on the cover of life magazine and also ran on the front page of the LA Times and a long time ago and I said of course there were a member of the photo everybody remembers that because I was only a few years younger than want when Bobby kennedy was assassinated and and I remember looking at a\nTeenager you know squatting Kennedy's side trying to help him and I thought my goodness he's not much\nOlder than I Am so I set out to try to find one that I found them living in San jose and I did the first story about one or Ninety eight\nSo take us back to June fifth Ninety sixty and remind us why one Romero was right next to Robert Kennedy when he was shot\nHe grew up in Mexico and the family moved to Los Angeles one one was about ... won recalled back in Mexico being an homes where there'd be two photos on the law on a poke in one of JFK\nYou know as a teenager after moving to Los Angeles was really young to be politicized but he did feel kind of marginalized of Mexican immigrant what do you remember of the counties was that they spoke of Mexican people as hard working God fearing family oriented so if you have to respect\nFor JFK and um he found out that Bobby kennedy who was touring California the Democratic primary that you're running for president of the United states someone had gotten a job as a bus boy if your bath or a hotel and when he heard but Kennedy was staying at the hotel and went to the other bus boys and he said I really want to meet this guy and\nIf there's a call from Kennedy's room\nI'll do anything I'll buster transfer a month I just want to be the sky\nSo for the call comes in and won with another bus boy and I go up and he said the Kennedy was in the room to move to the door but was in the room on the phone and kind of a threat to the one thought while I get to see 'em but that's going to be about it and then Kennedy gets off the phone goes up look some in the eye\nAnd shakes his hand and one said it was a hand to shake and he remembers the blue eyes of Kennedy and he said it was the first time he felt like an American the first time you call it like a man and he said he walked out of that room feeling ten feet tall so the next night\nI'll be community wins the primary he makes a speech and the Ambassador Hotel auditorium when he was making an exit through the pantry area\nAnd one was on duty and wanted to push through the crowd Kennedy remembered him reach out and congratulated him so he grabs communities him and here's the shots and next thing you know Kennedy is flat on his back and won didn't know they were shot thought it was maybe somebody had firecrackers and it was a prank\nBut won his writing under communities where the back of a hat tries to ... blood on this here and then he realized he was on my goodness and one was carrying rose remain with him he says you have them in his pocket pulled them out and he said he shut them into communities here and and uh he was ... it can away was grab my college\nCourse Robert Kennedy died um one Romero only Seventeen years old at the time incredible what happened to one Romero after that what kind of life did he live\nOne was haunted so much so that you have to get out of LA guests would come to stay up in a basket or and they were asked to see the bus or a bus or\nThey wanted to have their photos taken with whom he got some letters and he said most of the people who wrote a hammer contacting her more you did a good thing but he got some negative stuff to have people saying holy you hadn't reached out to shake because he didn't offer to shake your you know maybe you wouldn't have been shot\nAnd other people saying why couldn't you do something couldn't get between Kennedy and the shooter and one is Seventeen year old he couldn't deal with it could have a job and moved all the way to Wyoming and miss California came back but not to LA to northern California the San jose and eventually you know started his family and became\nA construction worker paving and I think the one one was Carmen one\nLeft a really difficult like and I think he was always on the run you wanted to go\nOn er and remember the moment and what he took to be the Kennedy legacy of compassionate tolerance and at the same time thinking about it back to the most horrible moment in his life and he didn't know how to express themselves\nAny kind of disappeared and he didn't talk to the media ... you didn't do much of anything except work his tail\nIt was only in recent years that he began to it began to snap out of it a little bit he began to listen to people who are telling you know you did nothing wrong\nYou have a relationship on Facebook with a woman from Germany who reached out to him when I wrote one of my columns and so you don't need to be some trouble you didn't do anything wrong and when I see that photo of news squatting accounting side\nI see somebody who was a brave young men who wanted to help someone in need while other people retreated and won began to see it that way and in his last year as I think\nThat a little bit of relief he was still kind of a search her he was always looking for something some ... some explanation as to why he was in that moment on and to figure out what he needed to do with it\nYeah it is unexplainable as an as you said you'd catch up with one Romero from time to time and one time you went with him to Arlington National cemetery to visit Robert Kennedy's grave tell me about that what was that like\nWant to talk for years about wanting to pay his respects\nYou wanted to go to community was gray and I was in Washington at the hotel where the night before he was going to go to ... it was a long time good buddy of has a retired TV newsman guy by the name of ... we were talking\nAbout has visited one was saying that he wanted to apologize talk like that for a long time in Rico and I said you have nothing to apologize for\nMe and said I just I just want to call him up you know I miss him but I Wish I could have found a way to stop the bullet so the next morning\nWe uh we go and wanted worrying who who's got the times square and we walk across the cemetery won one at a moment to himself with\nUnity and he walked over on the milk down you drop them any wept and he later told me that you just talk to you know what he was sorry and then you would never forget whom wish they could have done more\nThan just incredible to see some people live with their entire lives that was the LA Times reporter Steve Lopez remembering one Romero the busboy in that Nineteen sixty

World Service and you're listening to news hour with James ... live from our studios in central London\nWhen countries signed up to the Paris climate agreement in December twenty fifth ... they were allowed a certain amount of wiggle room on the big headline figure\nThey committed themselves to the goal of limiting the increase of the planet temperature to between one point five and two degrees Celsius by the end of the century\nWell three years on you and scientists think that the room for wiggling has disappeared at the time for an agency has come a major new report by the inter governmental panel on climate change all I eat PCC\nHas included that the lord of the two figures shouldn't be an aspiration but at some time if we want to preserve the planet the future generations are environment correspondent ... McGraw is in in ... in South Korea weather report was released\nThose are two key points really about this report the first is that's keeping temperature just a one point five degrees is far far better for the fun of them getting allowing them to go to two degrees which has been to stand up to now\nSo they're talking about things like coral reefs to talking about millions of people being flooded all those are actually much much better if they're kept to one point five years rather than allowing them to go to two degrees\nThe other big point in this report is that it is still possible to keep the one point five degrees if the world takes major steps such as cutting emissions by forty five percent of the next twelve years\nDispensing with cold as a power source altogether and\nBoosting renewables massively and actually getting people to change their lifestyle plus on top of all that we're going to need carbon removal technologies remove ...\nProfessor gyms ski is one of the reports all says he said the government's needed to waste no time in taking action\nWe really need to start working very hard right from ... if we're not going to see the options slip away so the the bold ... is that we need to see carbon dioxide emissions reducing by forty five\nPercent by twenty ... J uh compared to recent levels if we're going to put yourselves on truck on by the middle of the century we need to be taking as much carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere\nAs as we could turn on really these on dramatic changes that need the deployment of new technologies new approaches and also changes in behavior\nSo the message is indeed a very strong\nMessage from the scientist says that governments and individuals already have the tools the technology to shrink that carbon footprint but what's being lacking is the political will perhaps nowhere more evident than in Washington where President Trump is committed to pulling out of the Paris Agreement\nSo well is only PCC reports have any impact in the United States I've been speaking to Gina McCarthy the former administrator of the U.S environmental protection agency she was the lead on President Obama's climate change policies\nIn the United states at least ... people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public\nUnderstands that the real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as a faraway problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines are maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California in the west\nBut frankly you know climate change changes everything it really is the biggest threat that we have to public health today the U.S safety you know to uh wellbeing to our economy's to jobs this is about national security as well and people need to understand it and personalize it\nAnd if you look at the American it's not monolithic picture of it as you say the the White House the current administration Seventy takes a different views the administration usa but if you look in the Twenty one states say they still signed up to the Paris or agreements many cities many local ministry rations\nBots without central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's that long term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't the short term problem\nThis is this is a challenge where we have the solutions today\nWhich is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector but it's a long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about an hour jobs on yeah it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs are on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Austin", "day": "08"}
