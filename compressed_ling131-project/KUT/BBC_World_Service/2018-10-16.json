{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Just thinking about it does this really makes sense to me but then they're sitting with it\nAnd it enters into ... different level deeper level so how do we call to cultivate this way of being\nWith ourselves and each other and the world that supports\nThis kind of radical intimate engagement you're just\nJoining us we're talking about mindfulness a climate want I'm Greg Dell from I guess are Josh treatment and make levy let's go to our first question welcome\nWhen a return of the question about the Koch brothers\nUm [laughter] I'm sure people are interested in that\nI don't feel a victim from the Koch brothers but I Do feel like their perpetrators ... and I'd like to hear a little more I appreciated what Chris Jones said about not wanting to get into the place of dual ism and victims and perpetrators\nBut they are clearly perpetrated a crime upon our children when someone comes\nAnd tries to break into your house and kill your kid you're not going to pause about cheese in mind the right mindfulness moment so can you help me with that because I I sense where she's going with it and I don't quite get there\nI mean are they to be on one hand there's a you know questions of of ethics\nOf harm and a societal a how do we work with that and that's all very real and necessary and not just to say oh anything is fine and it's all love but it also is all love\nAnd the sense that what I think what's being asked and I think what she was trying to to also say is\nI think we're being asked not to other ... not to put that wall of separation\nYou know that they whoever they are there you can get you know we're we're talking on one particular part a set of people here but it you could go on endlessly and our tendency is like oh no no\nThe and in fact even when a when we feel a sense of what's unfair just in our brain we actually start to shut down and don't feel the pain is that person as much so knowing that we're wired to do that but how do we get beyond that to include a sense of\nOf justice and a communal decision making about how we work with is that not do the other thing\nThat it's much more vastly interconnected than that and I that's that's kind of getting that the key I think of when all of this is\nJosh raven I just I also don't know I mean I've met a lot of people and I met a lot of people that I disagree with a lot but I actually haven't met anybody who I could say yeah they're evil\nEverybody that I've met is doing the best they can with what they have and what their perspective and what they have is different than what I have\nSo from that life experience\nI guess my inclination is to consider that somebody is making the decisions that they're making that from there if it from their perspective those are the best decisions and\nI don't always get there I really don't you know sometimes I just I Want to something like foot and scream at the right\nBut then when I sat back and I say what what is the most powerful place for me to stand would come back to his standing in that place of ... they're doing the best they can with what they have I'm doing the best I can with what I have\nHow can we bring those together and we can't bring it together\nIn less\nI'm willing to see them\nAs equally good and me as equally good which is really really hard\nQuestion yes welcome

very difficult to do\nWe came together to deal with World War two to deal with Hitler and we we all had a purpose that was common and that was because we were afraid of Hitler\nHow can we come up when you see her as a positive\nUh inclusive energy rather than thinking of as simply as something that you wish you close down and protect ourselves it's a beautiful\nQuestion I mean I think fear is a huge gift\nRight I think so is anger so is joy so is the light you know so he's jealousy like these their all their their teachers um [noise] so I think the first step is to become less afraid of our own feelings and for me that's been a\nTwenty plus your journey says like hey it's okay it's okay to feel\nUm has you know sort of Buddhist sting\nSuffering comes from denying what is so I'm feeling something All right\nThat's interesting you're feeling something okay that's interesting a fear is about something we care about is at risk what is it that we care about hey guess what\nThere is something we both care about [laughter] we may have we made it she be the cause of that risk to the different forces but can we find where that shared commitment is and maybe it's you know that hey we all we would all like our children to be able to breathe\nYou know maybe it's just simple as that and so if we can if we can find where that\nWe're that common ground is instead of whose fault it is and we can focus on what we share what ... what we share that were really afraid about and maybe just being able to speak to our own fears and being able to admit\nPay I'm scared about this that's a

Rosenbaum of Northwestern University in Chicago\nSo what we found is that the males who spent the most time what we call affiliating which in this particular case means grooming and resting in contact\nWith the infants in their group are also the males who ended up firing the most insects and this was definitely not something we expected this is not a monogamous feces the males don't seem to discriminate between their infants and the influence of other males are and yet in spite of that it appears that it may have some sort of benefit for them\nSo what you'll speculating is the more ... tunnel the guerilla is the more females choose to mate with guerilla\n[noise] yes so that's our speculation we can't prove causation yet um we are working are coming up with some ideas to try to test\nA alternative possibilities for this but right now we think that the most plausible explanation is that the females prefer to mate with those nails in particular\nWhy wouldn't they because they want to help us I mean that's the kind of like a rather blunt sort of I suppose a human way of looking at it but what could be the Russians do they look and do they know the ... between\nThe father and the child does the father only bummed with his own child will just she bummed with more children in the guerilla group she\nDoesn't seem to bond only with his own kids so we published a paper a couple of years ago that showed that they don't seem to discriminate between their infants and other males and fence it's hard for me to believe that the mothers don't notice that you know they they pay attention to what's going on around them [noise]\nUm we don't know exactly why female should prefer this ... where it's not exactly clear what nailed care is getting them\nBut what we're speculating right now is that perhaps this is basically a signal that males are giving to females\nThat when they meet arises for them to do something really important like protect and in the sense that they're willing to do it and this is how they show females that one\nThing I'm I'm intrigued by is that the mothers will obviously be involved in specifically maternal I imagine ... kind of thing when we when we say that the males have a stroller paternal row how strongly about or they just like washing the dishes once a month kind of thing [laughter]\nSo what are the things is very striking when you study mountain gorillas anytime you are around males you are also around infants so from the time that instance art all old enough to be moving around independently from their mothers\nMales adult males specifically are seem to be there are other preferred adult companion\nSo males do a lot of um what we have colloquially call babysitting or in the literature but they also do a lot of behaviors like playing with them wrestling with them grooming them a rafting in contact which is basically the equivalent to sort of sitting on somebody's lap if you're a human um are sitting right next to someone on a couch\nUm you know certainly the amount of care taking that they do is nothing compared to the females but again for a mammal it's incredibly unusual and it's really hard not to watch this behavior and to see something in it that looks a lot like what we see in humans\nAre that's what's going to be my last question when you'll that watching in the wild obviously you're watching as a scientist but surely some of you is sort of tracking across in sinking in human terms what this would be looked like a ... this would look like I mean you mentioned\nSitting on the sofa does it sometimes looks to you that they are sitting side by side on the sofa or sitting in dad's lap\nAbsolutely yes it is impossible you know yes of course you're you're a scientist and you're trying to be as objective about this as he can but you know you wouldn't be human if you didn't see some sort of parallel and it really does look like the sorts of view relationships that you see between many fathers and their children\nAre ... amazing not the best jobs in the in the world pretty good data that amazingly would be humans and you can almost like really humans are the best well anyway uh but the grill is a pretty extraordinary and those I should say all the mountain gorillas of Rwanda that are being studied\nBy Stacy Rosenbaum levy a cruise in the midst of a damn ... bunch of ...

I\nThink it\nWould have voice but on a more serious note ... was a fierce opponent of the commercialization of the Viennese press and she won't give us an idea of what he was actually attacking a bounce it\nWould invite you and your listeners to visit the website all student newspapers online of the ... national library\nAnd just browse through some of the issues there of the press of to be a nice dress around Nineteen hundred so but you will find there is that around fifty percent I'm often use a paper pages\nOf those newspapers without a ... party political background or they consisted of ... ... s really played an important grew\nForties newspapers and I'm more overdid voice perfectly normal at that time in Vienna to buy an article in the new section so this means that promotional text book published like news in the form of news um without labeling it\nSo he was raging against the commercialization in an under corruption as he put it all the newspapers and um\nToday people often cool called currents himself a journalist but his was a very particular type of journalism and he was in a unique position and he was able to\nIt and publish his magazine de facto which means the torch\nIt rent is thirty seven years total nine hundred and twenty two additions is about six million woods and that editorial independence they had meant he was not beholden to any special interest beat a political or commercial but tell me seem on how unique was grounds his independence\nWell just a hug with um ... financially independent because he inherited a lot of money from his wealthy father on all skin Jewish papal men effect or a cold um yeah I could cause\nThese means that ... did not have to ride for another paper they didn't have to become a tradition a journalist and get paid for delivering news to save for a newspaper but apart from these financial independence I think it's more important to emphasize\nThat cows both really independent in an ideological a fence or what I mean is that he both never really ideological if you understand this\nTone up by I'm\nThinking about people who are totally fixed into political ... so he in this sense in this political sense evil is never ideological at all\nAnd I suppose when you till till the hidden being ideological sense that it was that reflects hidden sometimes seeming contradictory as well I think and and to be fat what he was doing wasn't vanity publishing the the magazine often sold between thirty and forty thousand companies ...\nAnd in a typically shocked tongue sentence Crouse commented on ... plus as\nI Am my public understand each other very well it does not hear what I say and I don't say what it wants to hear [noise]\nNow ... says studied punishing de facto in Eighteen Ninety nine offers spin of working as an actor and a journalist for other publications I'm Ari tell me what was he rain against in general what motivated him to write\nYou saw most newspapers and most editors not all or I should add but most\nI'm as always beholden to particular interests and so in a sense a when one read something in the newspaper one was not reading news as for cross it sort of ought to be delivered um these are not agents of information as cross I think thinks that are thought that a journalist should be\nRather individuals that were beholden to various political and economic interests and yet this was often disavowed or at least not made explicit and so you know one of crosses\nConstant targets of critique I could say is the is the inherent sort of do the city of journalistic language the way it claims to have some kind of independence but really when pressed or when exposed in different ways shows itself to be either ideological are motivated by economic interests or\nA more dubious political and that that were not made obvious to the public and so that's certainly one of the main areas of of uh of concern that cross expressed in his writing\nAnd just to be clear in nearly is difficult published not just across the ... on the original writers from Vienna and beyond but from about Nineteen twelve grounds basically been laid ... the magazine himself\nI no longer have collaborators I used to be envious of them they repel lose readers who might want to lose myself\nCross was less interested in in breaking news stories that in commenting on what others have written as we've mentioned already\nHe would find a piece of of pull report saying oh sloppy language use or human fully in the articles of the time and then you take you to punch through such typical comments he would often stop by exposing it's absurdity all by simply clicking debates ... printing the only thing\nHere is an example ... advertisement\nWanted a father in law to go into the women's Web business with me I'm twenty three years old and will know who knows a women's west salesman no matchmaking\nAnd then there was no mention of the bride and the and this is who they were serious

Lyndon\nNow as I alluded to before the break cross match his great love she's only nine hundred ... in Nineteen Thirteen just a year before certainly things in your which turned upside down by the outbreak of World War one\nThe Austria Hungarian ... played a key role in the ... not least because it was in Nineteen fourteen assassination of the edge to the end pies thrown that became a trigger for the war\nAnd I like many of his friends ... was skeptical about it from the stones so tell me what was his reaction to the declaration of of hostilities\nYou know we already talked about how he thought that the press destroyed imagination and he was one of the people who really tried to imagine what would happen and from the first date on he knew that would mean death and and suffering and direction\nAnd I think he was kind of shocked to see people celebrating and thinking is with the ... and then nothing much Manhattan\nHe did at first ... probably also hoping that it wouldn't last too long and maybe yeah it was ...\nAnd he also I think he needed some time to find a position for which to speak because of course they didn't and so easy that whole nation is celebrating and supporting the when you ... [laughter]\nSo he had first declared that he would be silent he would just remain silent and not say any [noise]\nYou sound like that did not last very long and only a few months later classes they decided that he would publish defecate ... he would take a stance against their will\nCross also thought that the press was implicated in starting the war how is the will rule didn't lead to will diplomats liked to journalists and believe these lives when they see them in print\nSays you know that's a general observation but what will cross his main objections to the way that the Austrian press was reporting on the war\nFor ... to vote for both Maine to an amplifier in all the problems of looking at the same is true for the press or the ... the press problem and this problem for coal is lost from the beginning\nThat the press is not reporting they are not reporting fix they are not establishing fix that day has spreading opinions moods rumors\nAnd yes he he was particularly skating listen the of some of the the war reporters who instead of concentrating on ... ... ... soldiers inane questions and in fact here's how cross immortalized one such ... in his play the last

[noise]\n\nAnd that's from a radio version of the last days of mankind dramatized by Giles half ago [noise]\nUm crafts began writing the play in about Nineteen fifty and it turned out to be a mammoth undertaking some seven hundred pages whereabouts ten evening's performance is\nClearly it's possible to give a show somebody or something so long and complex but I Would tell me get an idea of what ... ... is trying to do here and how he's doing it\nBut it's important to probably first emphasize that nearly half of this play consist although I don't think it's ever been determined the exact amount but nearly half consists of actual quotations\nCross lifted from either newspapers or from conversations that he eventually overheard on the streets of Vienna or in the cafes where he spends his days\nAnd I say this because this fact has led to some commentators to call this play something of a documentary play which is not an entirely an accurate description Kraus is definitely documenting the war in words we could say\nAnd in part because I'm Simone and Katrina have established the journalists who were supposed to be doing this or not for the most part is cross thought they were swept up in the nationalist fervor that cross identified as something of a of a kind of collective ...\nAnd so Kraus has um we could call them an alter ego in the play the grumble or\nWho maintains a running dialogue with his dialogue partner the optimist\nWho is presented as a much more naive figure than than a malicious figure 'em and and I say this because the optimist\nTends to be someone who kind of reproduces newspaper headlines\nAnd he takes their content at face value so he doesn't have really any critical dimension to his his audience is and this is precisely crosses point that what was counting or what constituted is healthy commonsense over which of course the newspaper editors held dominion\nWas the very problem and the play we could say puts on open display the actual motives of the war is cross saw them profit\nNationalistic muscle flexing techno mania we might call it and romantic ideology in this kind of mixture and cross would say you know the collusion between among these impulses is what led to and what perpetuated the war\nIf I could also maybe reduced the drama to another crucial inside and and as you said reducing this drama to any you know number of insights would be a kind of insult to the to the complexity in just to the massive undertaking that it was but it would be this that crosses\nAstonishment that an entire civilization appeared willing to destroy itself in part because of the new media technology so not only the press but in this case also film and photography which play roles in the in the play\nHave made it actually possible to become a spectator to one's own self destruction and cross actually write something of this sort in the sort of the forward it actually even prior to the place prologue cross I Would say prefer to be a witness not a spectator\nSo either way you could say it's kind of ... of them look they don't keep drama isn't it that that play I'm an old she took about ... the mania and as with so many things you can crush that's due to technology will as complex\nHe liked the convenience of something like the ... but he also dislike the noise and the ... they created\nContradictions would seem to be running through his his life then again he also felt that far too often technology was not being employed well and as far back as Nineteen weights he rose complicated enough to build machines and two primitive to make themselves\nAcross the just bad of the war and the ... of humanity that exposed as he observes the devil is an optimist if he thinks he can make people mean\nOff the horror and probably ... of the wall came the dissolution of the Austrian Hungarian and planned this happened a hundred years ago in October and then of Nineteen Eighteen tell me what was crowned says reaction I mean after all his native country what his great no seed money still resigned as\nIt became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to us and then Katrina said early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than probably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy has actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic um I Would actually argue that cross as the war was dragging on especially did not only really anticipate the outcome of it was\nBut that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what you saw was holy and moral institution to ruin that is a very institution that actually ... who is the war on subjects and the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what the scholar Edward Tim's is called the quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring what concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war\nWe wore no shoes to a straight poverty was taking place the bees represented the Lynch is that is taking place throughout the south so

from the yield curve right now what you're really thinking is it this is as good as he gets on the world is ... now than ever is going to feel some some pain in the future that's what you'll frightened don't\nYup today's show is all about gazing at the economic reasons and whether we should be starting to get good well maybe not this is\nMy problem is everyone is forecasting crash accepted me so I think we're actually at the beginning of a period of remarkable growth probably the most interesting period of innovation since the industrial revolution\nReading the tea leaves business daily from the BBC [noise]\nSo you may or may not have noticed that in fact you probably haven't but there is some things are you on the ball market these days about a certain kind of a curve on a girl off but threatening to bend the wrong way\nOr that you know hey look I just kept getting flash at well now that was not sane in about a decade and ... that's such a huge worry because it's probably a reflection of inflation expectations\nBriefly mentioned ... something that people are talking about a lot of how do we know where it is and what are the consequences of being above or below it that's really what what people are talking about the the slope and\nSay that strives to show and the cat and tens of the hills and what we see in the coming months with the\nHealth care of but I think we all\n\nYeah you wonder why more people to to watch the financial media anyway well they're talking about now I have to give it its proper name as the bungee all kind of a kind of the measures the various interest rates you can get for different kinds of us on market investments basically\nThe kind of it's flattening out which is unusual and it's making some market watches pretty edgy why what is it is just in America is Jewish he's co founder of seven investment management to explain\nShe's very simply ... which measures the yield over a new guest on bones over a period of time\nSo it will be going from say one week one month one year five years ten years and so therefore what it's telling you is how much that ills or to get to go up on this will be over that period of time and so you can measure although is he okay up we're going down and we would expect in a normal economic situation\nThat you get a ... on a ... a ball and then almost to the phones would we we don't expect that as he would with us she went along she'll building solve your bank and said I'm going to give you my money for five years in ten years I'd expect to get a better return\nBut sometimes you can get the opposite occurring and that she ends up going down the longer it is a ... cup it's going the wrong way people get very interested in that because there's no ends up with some strange events they're often you\nKnow just strange some say the flattening or investing curve is pretty terrible and find some experts reckon inversion deal cubs have successfully foreshadowed each of America's seven recessions over the last fifty years\nWell as some say anyway others disagree the fact is it hasn't fully inverted yet unlike old economic indicators it may not be took to infallible right now it seems downright implausible to some people the United states is enjoying record low unemployment high record high growth rates for the last decade so\nHow worried should we be his ... and he can only ... but\nIt does give out false signals no rule is completely infallible if he was making money from financial markets will be easy and it isn't that easy but I think ... the ... suggesting effect will continue to raise rates now but that in the in in the traditional way it will overdo it it will do too much too late\nThat the U.S economy will begin to slow down and the and the future it would have to re cans and stop the cult interest rates and that's really what he's saying and I think if you do believe in the signal coming from from the yield curve right now what you're really thinking\nIs it the U.S economy although he's doing Britain they now this is as good as he gets under the Trump tax cuts came at the wrong time of the cycle putting juice into the system when he wasn't needed with the results that are on the world it's called ... that now than ever\nHe's going to feel some some pain in the future and if you believe the the ... that's what you'll frightened all\nRight so basically the U.S consumer will feel start to feel overloaded as those interest rates rise and the fed will lead you notice is after it's too late\nYeah not just the U.S consumer the consumer is an issue but I think it's actually corporations they've taken ... two thousand and seven a lawsuit to fund that was a ... a little bit to fund share buybacks and dividends which you could use a little bit of financial engineering so I think if you are going to see a squeeze on actually think he might be that this time around\nSo the United states remains the weak point potentially in terms of the global economy\nI think at the moment is the strongest point I mean we've just had some numbers option to the U.S economy is going to do the full percent year along the lines basis but I think you could argue that it's the weakest link because everybody so convinced he's going to stay that way and I think when you look at\nThat being so much highs and lows inflation is just starts to creep up a little bit from St Pete investment points of view you've always got to be ... you'll most nervous when people are out there most confident\nIt does seem counterintuitive though in a way of

Norway is there a problem because nobody has a reputation for being excellent in its approach to gender balance in power for example\nIt's a sad reality that also and\nOh I think is happening and I have\nTo go back home now and make sure that there is a place for those women that are members of parliament ... who has said this experience that there is a place for them to go I'm not sure even in in a way which isn't there a democratic ... at a country which is very interested in being\nEach call between men and women and men I'm\nNot sure if there is a place for them and um but that's not something in the parliament that they care so that they have been listening to that ... days later the head and even if they let it be and tested that day story are correct I'm not sure\nIt's a bug powers and to be abusive power\nOf course it is and I felt so bad that Christie it is about you're right that this study shows me that we have to do more\nGetting so then in two thousand three there's this fire drill and and and it disappears\nRight that so the fire drill was supposed to be the perfect cover for this heist a it was a a group of uh uh of prison guards who worked at that jail decided to uh have a fire drill during the overnight shift\nAnd that ... pretty much the entire staff to one wing of the jail away from the painting and during that died about Fifteen minute drill three of the guards managed to take the painting down and replace it with a fake and and not very good fake\nSo they mess up the forgery how long did it take until uh people noticed the Dolly wasn't any wasn't there anymore\nNot not very long at all the painting was snatched a probably a little after one AM and about maybe six hours later one of the ah guards\nNotice that something didn't seem right about that painting had another guard look at it with him and they realize that is definitely wasn't a fake and from there they alerted the warden who quickly cordoned off the area\nAnd an investigator was called to to find out what happened\nRight this investigator his name as my career so he was with New York city and kind of in charge of finding that internal affairs among a corrections officers in the city and the like uh some suspicion landed on several wardens at Rikers right\nThat's right well not ... but a a system deputy ward and these are basically the highest level you can go in the ranks before you get appointed to being in a warden um and er during that\nGraveyard shift the where the uh there was two of them are a guy named Betty news out in a guy named Michel ... and they were basically the top man in charge that evening so or something was going to happen like a fire drill they're the ones who would have called it so suspicion immediately turned to them\nAnd inspector Caruso starts seeing that they're actually had been a plan a foot for some time it was not an impulsive thing right\nThat's right so a ultimately for guards are accused of taking the the ... uh one of the guards on an officer named Timothy opinion are the morning after the highest he uh is immediately wracked with guilt and remorse over what happened\nAnd he decides that he needs to burn themselves to investigators and tell them what happened and he goes in two days after the highest to the investigators and says I was part of this I was instructed by many news though in Mitchell hock house or to steal this painting\nAnd their plan was to sell it because they believed it was worth quite amount of money\nThey were planning to sell it on the black market for a million dollars\nAnd Timothy opinion is cut was supposed to be fifty thousand he was essentially supposed to be a one of the lookout man and ultimately he was uh involved and actually taking the painting down and putting up the fake which by the way they they uh they put\nUp the fake what the stapler so again not terribly loaded up just a replica\nUm so once ah my Caruso had a Timothy opinion talking to him he wanted the officer to help them even more so they convinced him to wear a wire and later that evening he met up with another one of the guards this time it's a gardening Gregory socal and they met at a a\nLike a little donut shop in Staten Island Timothy pen yeah and Greg socal again talk about what happened and they're both filled with\nWere Morrison paranoia that they're going to be caught and unbeknownst\nTo Gregory socal you know Tim ... is wearing a wire so once the conversation's over investigators swoop in and they take\nGregory socal into custody who once you've taken into custody also and burdensome south about the highs and again points to figure ad Michel ... and any news or as the ringleaders\nSo he has or convinces\nGregory socal to wear a wire himself\nAnd uh later that evening when silk all supposed to start his graveyard shift at the jail\nHe and many news though in Michel ... agreed to meet and talk about all the the heat that's on them about this heist\nAnd they meet in a a a an old locker room underneath the jail where there's like a hissing boiler and there's music playing from a nearby a weight room for the officers and they discuss\nThe case depending on who you ask investigators they would say that a Benny news though and Michel ... implicate themselves in those conversations and they you know talk about about how the heat is on them they talk about how this would never have happened if they use the better replica\nAnd the investigators after they have this they give us recording the conversation they feel like they have enough\nTo at least I'm actually get a search warrant I'm betting news those house rather his ... his mother's house they ransacked it they you know open up filled in fire places they look in the ceilings they don't find it\nSo there's some implication from the two thousand three highest that it it wasn't the first one that this piece is still on the art last list even today because the one stolen in two thousand three may not have been the original ... what's that about Benny\nWho ah who spoke to me for the article he had his his thoughts about what happened to what he thought that you know\nThat painting had changed hands so many times over the years you know it was it was in the cafeteria than it was it was a boxed up and then it was sent away to a gathering and Virginia than it was boxed up again and kind of forgotten about and then found in the trash bin\nAnd then went to a ... office and he believes that somewhere along the way\nMaybe somebody else might have taken up you know when there was a little less chance of being caught and and so many things that the the painting that they actually took from that lobby that jail was and was was already a fake was already a replica of the original one had gone missing long ago\nI got to say your story has enough young yang to it that I think they would really appreciate it himself\nIt is it's just a real story\nJames finale wrote the great
