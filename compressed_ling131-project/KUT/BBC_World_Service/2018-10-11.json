{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "[noise] how did you overcome your sinus\nI got over my shyness by forcing myself to you know in my career I was doing pretty well I'm kind of thing behind the computer screen and being I'm kind of an actual one on conference calls and and knowing kind of the new ones and the statistics\nAre pretty well up until I started to see other people\nKind of advance faster than me and when I Would think about why they were moving out for getting ahead or\nBeing successful in ways that I wanted to be I realized that it was because they were talking about their success they were sharing their story a and they were being up front and in front [noise] so I knew that I needed to\nYou know push myself to you know to do more to be seen to be heard and so I started asking\nFor both opportunities to do that a and to you know be the one who is leading a group or be the one who was presenting or offer to go on the radio show or the TV show but then I also knew that I had to kind of situate myself in a place of of leadership so that I could\nUm take advantage of some of those opportunities and and not be afraid to talk about you know\nMy own story in a unique what [noise] what\nWhat's the best advice that you've ever been given about convincing yourself to go outside your comfort zone\nSo this is my actually came to me uh not too long ago um I was talking with a friend about self promotion and this idea of self promotion uh and how sometimes for women it can feel icky or gross or hockey or brash\nOr what have you all the negative stereotypes that can be put on on the idea of\nBragging about yourself so to speak and we set up kind of a test and I said I said well I I did that today I sell promoted today and she she's like oh really you did and I pulled up the tweet that I'd written\nAnd she's like Cape this is not self promotion this is not it you need to do more than that and I got really uncomfortable because what I\nThought one that I was being super successful and smart [laughter] and here was a friend of mine saying no this isn't enough you need to do more and\nIt was really hard for me too and it you know it's something that I've struggled with is how to talk about myself and my achievement in a way that feels a natural to me and feels you\nKnow kind of acceptable by society you know this is the thing that I think most women and women who are looking to run for office it's a challenge that we face how do you talk about your success as\nWell not turning people off returning people away from you and you know the advice that my friend gave me was to to not be afraid to not be afraid to talk about myself I'm In a way that that felt\nGood for me but also was truthful to the awesome bad as work I was doing and to not you know be shy about that and it was easier said than done believe me\nIt took me a good twenty minutes to rewrite that's we [laughter] and\nI felt really uncomfortable when I hit send but it was even just a small thing like that on on social media that that kind of turn the corner from me and then when I started getting the positive responses back I was like oh okay so so\nIt's not as bad as I thought it was going to be or that that someone was gonna say oh I Can't believe Kate said that about herself how dare she it's like people actually lovely and supportive and you know and if they're not they're not um but at the end of the day I needed to do\nSomething that felt good for me and true to my my story and myself and I think for women candidates\nYou know who are navigating the space of of women being authentically themselves a and leaders and um you know being at the front of the room\nA in a time and space where we know that that women in all of our identities are often seen before we're heard\nUm I think anytime we are trying to uplift our own story Our own self it can feel not not great\nBut if there was this piece of advice that would be to be not afraid of that because in most cases it's going to be fine and you're going to gain more friends than you\nThan you lose thank thank you so much great great thank you for having me

countries all ... national regions of followed suit and it is now legal in more than two dozen countries\nIncluding the United states most of Western Europe\nSome other large countries such as Brazil and Mexico\nBut whereas marriage divorce\nA few days ago the ... case office for national statistics published it summary of the data so old of all she's in England and Wales into thousands in Seventeen ... section caught our attention divorces all same sex couples\nSo here's a question which same sex marriages are more likely to end in divorce those between men all those between women\nAnd the dates were clear about Seventy five percent of same sex divorces have been between women\nThere have been slightly more marriages between women but not nearly enough to account for the difference so women are getting divorced from women a lot more than men are getting divorced for men and this isn't just the u._k. the same problem shown in Belgium and villains Norway Sweden\nEverywhere whether a statistics on same sex divorce it's the same sex during the ... the divorcing\nThis latest won the war was going on but who could help us with such a question the onset of course is I was always an economist\nWe spoke to dump some arena a shade the Vancouver School of economics in Canada\nSo she's the author of dirty money a book which applies economic counties to the study of sex and love and she's been digging into the data for us to try to find a few reasons why it's more likely that women will most women and men will divorce men\nOne of the things that we do know about opposite sex relationships is that women are significantly more likely to be the one to initiate the divorce so then you might think well if there's two women and their relationship thing you're twice as likely to get somebody who wants out of the relationship if that's true that's one possible explanation for this story\nOkay so what other explanations if you have\nThe second thing that you think about is is how long people have been in a relationship so there's a joke that you might have heard about which is what does a lesbian and bring to a second date\nAnd the answer is and you're moving van with all of her possessions this is a stereotype the evidence is anecdotal but we can't say one way or another if this is the case just because the data doesn't exist there's always\nThis factories hype is true if the stories we don't have the evidence then the idea would be less new relationships move more quickly than we got married earlier and then maybe didn't realize I made a mistake\nThey are absolutely so they're they're not spending as much time getting to know each other before they get married there or not ... for several years for example before they get married\nMaybe that would be reflected though in day to we might have for example about the age of the people going into the relationship\nYeah no this is actually something that's very interesting and and it's interesting for me too because this new data set that has just come out as the first one where you've actually being able to observe this\nIs we know that people who marry younger are more likely to get divorce is a predictor of divorce\nAnd if you go and look at the data that has been provided we can see quite clearly that women in same sex relationships are younger than men who are in same sex relationship so they're broken down in in broad age category so it makes it a little bit difficult\nBut in the data that they are only thirty eight percent of women who edited the same sex marriages in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen only thirty eight percent or over the age of thirty five\nCompared to fifty two percent of men so women are marrying much younger than the men and so that could be one of the reasons why we see female same sex marriages divorcing at higher rates\nThan males same sex relationships\nAnd that makes sense or expose it then poses the following question as to why there is an age difference but we are we going to be speculation about about anything else\nWell this is not a thing is that we know that people who may or may first second third maybe fourth time are much more likely to get divorced and people who are marrying for the first time and that's another thing that we can actually see in the in the data that we've been provided\nSo among the women who are in same sex relationships thirty seven percent of them have already been married once before that is a very high number\nCompared to about twenty three percent of the men this doesn't prove anything but given that we know again that being married previously as a predictor of divorce then that's one possible explanation here and\nIt was it was surgery looked into this and related questions or what do you need now to go deep or is it more detail and the dates of the officers ... have what was it different kinds of questions or is it just that you just need to wait ten years rule is to become a little bit clearer because these divorces wanted to be happening for probably three\nYet time will definitely resolve a lot of these issues you know for example\nOne other possibility is as to why you see females same sex relationships divorcing at higher rates than males same sex relationships could simply be that women divorce more quickly after a breakup than men do and this is actually in that data so among the people who've been separated for two years before divorcing\nThere's Twenty one percent of the men to Twenty one percent of the couples\nDivorcing that our male same sex couples have waited two years before they divorced compared to only eleven percent of the women so given that marriage is fairly new\nGiven that divorces even newer I think that if we wait a few years we might see a leveling out if it's just simply a matter of the men are waiting a little bit longer they've separated we don't know if they've separated but they're waiting longer to you know file the paperwork August\nIt's interesting so we implicitly we're talking about observing relationship breakup but she would notice every relationship ... serving the finding of paperwork and maybe men just omitted from paperwork\nRight and that could be a function of a bunch of different things but it could have something to do with the fact that the women are probably more likely to have children and that if you have children you might want to get these details sorted out more quickly than if you don't have children\nAnd the ... to teach Christian was posed put you researched relationships and how they work and how they work\nSo I'm the same sex marriage that your friend witnessed recently if you'd been out for advice as to how to keep it together and how to keep that relationship going what would you have said\nIt's annoying to have a friend who is an economist who has all the stats on this because you know\nI see people get into relationships with somebody who is a lot older than themselves those marriages generally don't last at nine your age gap\nIs almost certain divorce statistically right not knowing each other very long these are very high numbers for divorce so I actually try not to dispense relationship advice to people but there are a lot of the most people do\nIn the corner of the the wedding who instead\n[laughter]\nAge of what is the one that I think comes off the most it's interesting because when I first started thinking about this issue of same sex marriage and women my first response was actually age differences because women and same sex relationships do have larger age differences and people who are\nIn opposite sex relationships but this is actually worked for making comparisons with men and same sex relationships because it turns out they have even bigger age differences than people in in opposite sex relationship so\nDoes so hard to analyze the argument our reasoning of a tweet\nTo two hundred eighty characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major permission minor permission to conclusion it's much easier to just use a two word phrase or hash tag that usually ends up adding to that kind of political division between my side and their side\nTo more and more we have to learn to be critical consumers are the messages around us and we need to understand what it is that makes it persuasive and then ultimately make a decision for ourselves what are we willing to be persuaded by\nProfessor Phillip ... is also a past president of the rhetorical society of America\nOne of the things we see particularly in politics around the world these days are what would be considered fallacious arguments one that we hear a lot especially in democracy is what the Romans called at population which is an appeal to the people and this is when you sort of say well everybody agrees everybody knows\nWhen you talk to every single expert and you just talk to ordinary people and you talk to businesses everybody understands but the problem is not getting better\nIs getting worse when maybe we actually don't all agree to this but you're just creating the illusion that there's some public opinion whether it's actually not any opinion that's been articulated by the public\nThe other that we hear a lot in contemporary politics of the ad hominem which is an attack on the person and so especially I guess in our country it seems as last few years that politicians have been much more likely to go negative attacking aspects of the character of another candidate and not actually dealing with the issues\nThat St matter reminds you know just ... you probably are worse to a gym but [noise] I Will say anything nasty guy now I Know why he does not one endorsement from his own thing gets covered over\nThrough had populism or it goes negative as an ad hominem we may find ourselves persuaded but we still don't really know the basis of the stance of the candidates were now support it\nLet's say you're reading an article on line about whatever's going on in the world and the rhetoric and there is so when you one way or the other the more you know about rhetoric the more you can see when you are maybe being persuaded in a way that you don't want to be persuaded\nCare meisters one of Kendall Philip students for her there are clear reason to concentrate has studied on rhetoric and its influence on her generation she's twenty two but that doesn't make it easier to describe the cost to friends\nA lot of times they don't even know what rhetoric is there like so what are rhetorical studies in to this day I still struggle with explaining it but I think it's frustrating when people are reading things that are kind of your swayed but you're like no really read the tuna lined see what they are saying\nIf we can be so easily influenced by the words around us is this yet another arena when machines may have something to teach us\nI think that one of the claims made by ms ... was that people

there's no question that\nThe financial crisis puts a damper on the possible outcomes in that very parking Copenhagen climate summit in two thousand nine and I would argue that one of the reasons given off and was\nEven behind the scenes the discussions with political leaders especially from the so called developed countries was that you know we can deal with this right now because of the
