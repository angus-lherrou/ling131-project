World Service we find out from both sides of the money to bring that will stick it\nWalking does you for me to you is the definition of\nWho I Am and all I Know I grew up in the chat with burst into the church and it defines everything that I Do all the choices that I make this is going to go to our existence\nDo too long it was all said the state to the church raised in face by her mother and a black church in the white Patricia herself would be molded but as she grew up she no longer felt that he said\nThere's a portion of the service where people who have not yet accepted Jesus as are loaded they walk forward and as soft music and everyone looks at the person they have to walk down the ... the entire congregation\nIt was almost like a rite of passage like if you grow up in this church at some point do you have to get up and walk slower and it's the expected\nSo during this part of the service my heart would be up to slap my palms would let because I Would think I have to get it at some point but I don't feel palace\nAnd I was worried that something was wrong with me\nThere was a profoundly unsettling moment for an African American family in alone has journey at that time\nFrom the dog ... Denver hope Patricia describes how her daughter came across a particular passage in the Bible possibly lesser written in the early days of Christianity where the author refer to slavery a practice also comment of course much more recently in America\nThere's a push up the ladder where he says slaves should obey their masters which of course was a passage that the slave holders used to justify this slave history of this country and when she read that in the Bible it was a huge turnout for her\nThat the vitals she'd been taught to believe said that slave should have made him\nAnd says ... increasingly driven away from Christianity\nFirst I strayed completely away from religion at all but later on I started to feel like I still believed in God and so that led me to the nation of Islam\nThe nation of Islam was moving founded in the United states in Nineteen fifty which sole Christianity has a religion for whites and a black Americans to follow Islam\nAt that point I knew nothing about [noise] orthodox Islam or anything like that I just wanted to find God and I knew about the nation they were familiar and so I sort of went direction\nOf all those father done since it was something else closer to home that pointed towards the nation of Islam\nI think the added issue which you know I'm not really addressed fully is the fact that you didn't look black\nBut I didn't need it for that matter\nNot really what is he is he Puerto Rican too busy [noise]\nWhat is he you know what is she so to some extent I explained her coming into the whole Muslim thing as a way of achieving something to identity at a time when you're looking to find a group to belong to\nLumping Muslim\nSo the nation of Islam was perhaps a way of reinforcing allow new sense of African American identity a trip to the supermarket on them unwilling to compliment from a stranger was the catalyst for longer taking another significant step towards becoming a Muslim\nAnd then mom and even though I wasn't wearing full he job I was trying to dress modestly\nAnd so when the person said to me I think it was like you know you look good or something like that I was so offended and I just immediately took that as a sign that I needed to cover and so I went home I open the car on and it open to the chapter on the job\nRight on that same right page and I read the verse Henry before but this time when I read it almost felt like God was telling me that this is for you and it just basically says you know for men and women to lower their gays in the address my sleep\nAnd I met this guy was speaking directly to me at that moment I went in my closet and I found really scary and at least share it and I went to my mom's closet and she had these really two maybe three really ugly seventies style scarves [laughter]\nThat's used there were over her shoulders and that was the style but still had faded and so I just took it and put it on I didn't know where it had a bunch of ... like all over the place is falling off\nBut I felt really good I felt safer I guess he would say from comments like that man had made and the guy she star from that moment I worried dad\nSo Patricia as on this adoption of the job stood echoes of unpleasant and cruel experiences of heroes\nGet on the school bus and nobody would want to sit next to you because you're black or\nMy dad would take us in the mountains for picnics and we get out of her car\nWith other black families and all the white families would get in their cars and leave and it's a lot of\nEffort to live through that\nAnd survive it and then when I finally got to a place where I Know I Am I'm comfortable in my own skin\nThen my daughter puts on his job and I can't go anywhere with her without getting the same glances looks and I remember thinking I already did this I don't want to do this again and so I resented it\n... the owner was becoming comfortable with this law far from it but with what she felt was racism of a different kind of the nation of Islam doctrine of black superiority of white people\nDidn't understand how a group could believe in God but also believe negatively about certain people based on skin color\nAnd also because I was so light skinned as an African American and felt like it was almost like self hatred for me to feel hatred toward the white race for what happened in America and so at that moment I got a big trash bag I Do all of my nation of Islam stuff in there\nAnd posters read books and I only kept my car on and my Bible\nAnd I went to the dumpster and I came back to my dorm room\nThen I just picked up the phone and call mom and said mom and decided I'm a Muslim\n[noise] the morning she called me\n[noise]\nI thank you for calling and then I asked her how our car was running after fighting with a lot of four\nYears I had no more energy left\nConfronting that mutually exclusive views about face including the Christian belief that the only way you're receiving God's forgiveness is by believing in ... following Christ for Patricia wanting alone to return to Christianity was a key issue but she still won't that no\nI still believe that I still feel that and I hold those feelings still for everyone and her family but argued about that it has not been helpful\nAnd what does a loner feel about this\nI understand why she says that because she has a sincere conviction interfaith and I appreciate that about her actually admire that about her in the town I Know that about her it doesn't\nBother me that she wants that she feels that way because I understand how it feels when someone says you're not allowed to feel that we're seeing that are\nThat if you have lots of protests the judgment to mental might not be around not just an important issue\nSummit perspective is that got holds the ultimate decision where people are going after they die my point of view on it is that\nI Know that she sincerely believed in what she believes in and I really don't see a plane debating about whether or not I think she's going to be rewarded and the afterlife or not Patricia agrees\nThat really hasn't said to me to worry about that when I hear in my spirit from God is keep loving people and the detail of heaven and hell we'll get taken care of\nI could see people who have hell on earth because of the choices in arguments and fights and that they have every day I'd rather have heaven on earth and after life\nOr keep having to remind myself with these two women were ... speaking to for a long time\nAlone or a poll ... down in Texas and tend to see along

all that to more they're going to be really\nQuestioning what's going on in their lives\nThey watch them grow up I think about what my mother and I went through I think about how difficult it probably

capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to learn the navy and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved\nAnd respected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing his life\nIt was shot to death the day after he gave us Sunday sermon directing himself specifically to the members of the armed forces in saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral ordered to go out and and kill people\nAnd he ended the famous words I beg you I plead with you I order you in the name of God stop the repression and that did not go down well with some of the authorities and there was a phrase that people use a lot about him\nThen that is that he was seen as the voice of those who have no voice and had no voice\nMeans they were afraid to speak at themselves because of what the consequences could be and they saw plenty of evidence of other people who has spoken out and had paid for with their lives so he was he was regarded really as speaking on behalf of a lot of other people who dare not speak at themselves\nAnd when you say he spoke out what was he speaking out against\nAt that time the economy was overwhelmingly agricultural people out in the countryside

his movement here to ensure the\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so

heading to Abidjan quit the what to do a fellowship at the African development bank um I'm back in the u._k. a as a post doctoral fellow at the very early career fellow at the University of Oxford department of international development and I'm looking at race citizenship and postwar reconstruction in Liberia and Sierra Leone\nOkay and say well specifically you going to be studying in as well\nAs opposed to a research though I'm not studying I'm doing research um and doing quite a bit of riding around um Liberia and Sierra Leone have to re space citizenship clause is effectively state that only black people people and you go to the same can be citizens and it's precisely because of the colonial on slavery history of the two countries\nSo I'm trying to figure out how this is it impacted the twenty first century postwar reconstruction in both countries given that you've got large populations and Indian and Chinese and I'm\nA Lebanese merchants who I'm not allowed to be

ministry in Berlin LAX where they were holding today conference on the legacy and the contemporary meaning of World War one\nAnd it felt like a very contemporary discussion even though of course it's a hundred years ago because of all the changes in ... in Europe but that was that took that China which many people often didn't it was actually ... all of World War one up people in West ... perhaps of the the trenches flown to feel that\nThey didn't know that and it was actually a hundred thousand Chinese workers who are involved in taking those trenches and the Chinese were actually involved in the war then expect like she gained Kevin ... an other concessions from the west and tell us from lake George and\nCamels so often and they didn't get it and that was one of the sources of the resentment against the west that brought grew up is actually into the Chinese Communist movement says what one is about a year at the ... this year it's not just about\nEurope how could something so huge shift being so I looked\nI think in some senses let me sit in the west as we all doing now we forget that when we talk about the world was faced with us then the second that they really were global particularly close the ration self confident\nSo it's worth remembering that live of course we tend to concentrate on the European side in fact or to the way in which countries deal with each other in Asia has changed just as much if not more because of this conflict the festival a war of course but of course in a sense the second World War and what happened to Japan China\nKorea is also a product of the huge devastation in Asia at that time and sometimes we could do well to just look a bit more those pumps the world and they sort of from where we sit in the west\nBriefly it's a hundred years since the end of the ... has that increased interest or is it now becoming ancient history to some people [noise]\nI think in some sense is the legacy of that remains with us even more strongly if you think about British high schools people that still read wall poetry and concentrate on on that\nI think the biggest problem is that World War one still at war in a sense which doesn't have all these meaning people are still trying to figure out why on earth so many millions of people died in such horrible second stances and in a strange way\nThat keeps the ... because it's not a war that can provide and meet harmonious ending in terms of the narrative behind it and\nThey story ends at least that remains a very fascinating subject\nRun up rub do really good to see this morning here's

the same for a right to\nBe a detriment to the violence is very very alive we will be hearing from\n... to about shortly my two guests are Ron I'm is a professor of the history and politics of molten China and Rob ... highly Liberian or thought and academic and anti corruption expert which is important because\nIs corruption on the rise my feeling is for most people the chance to that question is going to be either an emphatic yes all\nCautious maybe according to Transparency International one in four people around the world\nAdmits to pay a bribe when accessing a public service in the last twelve months the organization has launched a future against corruption will this month that his inviting Eighteen to twenty five year olds\nAround the world to submit ideas for new ways to fight corruption and I'm pleased to say that I'm joined by two guests down the line Casey Kelso runs Transparency International policy and advocacy to we'll hear from him in a moment but first that speak to friends is a\nDean ... who's one of the organizers of the youth will that I just mentioned from Cisco good morning welcome to weekend what\nYou want to achieve from this why don't you think that you can offer a solution here\nMorning well the idea behind the future against corruption of war it was to give young people around the world the opportunity to become agents of change and have their ideas be herds\nWe wanted to give them a platform to express their ideas but also to be able to connect with each other for them to know that there's others out there and just like themselves who wants to fight for a future without\nCorruption so it was really about all the gene that young people today are the leaders of tomorrow and if we empower them to stand up against corruption today they will have the tools to shape a fair a future\nLet me introduce you to Rob ... nature I highly who's with me in the studio here in London ... you'll book takes a similar approach may be at a slightly younger age but there's a there's a definite connection here\nSure some anti corruption children's book about buying a sequel or ... which is coming out later this year which focused primarily on integrity um I wrote the books because I really wanted us to have a conversation with\nYoung children about how to be accountable to some of the nation to globe 'em and beyond that you know I've gotten some critique from people about the books and they say well why are you focusing on children\nUm they can't change policy and yes precisely but children have the capacity to change practice and for me sometimes changing practice\nUm is more important than changing the foot of the high level policies because quite often there's lots of policies and regulations on the books about how to enforce anti corruption I'm I'm actions\nBut a those are ultimately ... uninformed um and so if we can change the value systems across the globe about what it is that we actually valued devalue honesty to be value integrity between value\nUm you know people living lives that are that are accountable then perhaps we can enforce those policies much more meaningfully and so that's what the intention of the book is so it's great to see that you guys are now targeting I'm Eighteen to thirty five year olds which is an important demographic\nI'm In the scourge against corruption\n[noise] for instance is neither based on fat to expect young people to fly the flag of anti corruption when the grown ups have set off a world where they either blend in will file\n[noise] yeah but you know corruption is a major threat to the CIA people as well and their development in terms of access to education and employment for example and many\nPeople are forced to pay bribes in order to get ahead so I think it's really all about a change in attitude that's why it's so important to educate young people for a very early stage so that they can learn that corruption does not have to be the norm they can learn about their rights and see how much better society is without corruption\n'em and only then can be really build a movement of young people who challenged corruption and even resisted and not become part of the system that grown ups have battled for them and it is easy to feel powerless as an individual against the system\nAnd and that's why also with the pitcher against corruption awards we want and the winners to have the chance to work directly with our local offices in their country to support them with implementing their idea\nWhat kind of young people do though\nI mean you know if young people maintain the status quo there will be no change and young people especially a more open to social change they use a lot of ways of communication to connect with each other\nAnd they're at tech savvy so there's a lot of potential and that and I think it's really about empowering them and giving them a role in the fight against corruption and it's really about\nYou know trying and and of course ... is an option but complacency and indifferent or not\nThat's bringing Casey Keller so Tracy you run Transparency International policy and advocacy to Australia whether corruption is on the rise what do you say\n[noise] uh yes I we see are starting by your decade or more ago crushing globalized so instead of\nJust petty corruption and there's a grand corruption system or a criminal service industry that of all with\nAccountants and lawyers people who set up a show companies and these huge dirty clothes have gotten larger and larger which means that a lot of the fines get larger and larger and there's no mobile policemen there's no\nThere's no natural enemy of these ... financial flows that gold from London to Africa or back and forth worth or Singapore\nPanama there's a lot of money sloshing around up there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about really big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah but um I Know well I'm a the author and ... I can talk about for the local level which is extremely important at the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure to a banks or or\nA lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts of money billions of dollars that go into ... dictation laundering or into a contract so one of the biggest of their schemes words in Latin America were billions of dollars were spent auditions\nRoped tells you you wanted to come in here\nYeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples up because I mean although Transparency International has that corruption perception index with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've got billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through you know invading taxes through transfer pricing\nI'm mostly from Poland foreign multinationals and you have you know they'll do with the leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of a corrupt practices um and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence spaces more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be Transparency International should be thinking about looking at\nThose evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa and then the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that rocking story I did mention it you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days it's been one of the series of high profile arrest this time ... who was the head into pole may seem to be picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery an innocence what China's been doing particularly the last year also with the setting up with something called the national supervision commission\nThis is a fictional and uh I didn't want foods only the group that I can see the the guilty guilty in my family of course how the right wing or meters but I have to concede that are so nobody's all the points of view so I boosting the boot some conservatives have\nMore right wing characters and so I'm more left wing characters so that everything is present or is it ... ... how you get yourself into the place where you can do that given what you've been through [noise]\nWell I think that these are my ... having a journalistic point of view\nBecause only politicians have one point of view and they know everything and they know what to do and they know who is ... ... they know who who is not guilty you know who you have to put everything do you hope to politicians read your book\nOh they can read they only [laughter] the ... of a pet or be shown some programs on TV and it's a it's a gay Indian although not even the landowners we read the book is a book about ... about ...\nDo have rights to have a ... do you have right to have a land that's a difficult discussion I didn't end to in that discussion but I didn't want in Columbia my ... to become a booth for\nProperty for some ... we wear landowners no for them for the big landowners\nOr if you seem possible to imagine they are very macho so for them to imagine something in their minds are being gay hands no they don't they don't like that\nI have to ask you one thing before you go because it's one of the standout features and you'll see the un expelled from university for rushing offensive things about the pope and then you move to actually was that just to sort of Rob soldiers into the [laughter]\nYes it was because of a lead to the pope John Paul ... on the road to about ... and they move treats early because of sex for you because I was in love\nWith any type of young guys who uh went for studying singing so I went food for the same reasons I wrote the article for being free of loving wherever I Want to and a free sex before marriage that was was Boop was against\nColombia and author and journalist Hector Abad speaking to me that about his latest book the from listening to that rubbed ... round that Rob tell I saw you lost particularly when ah ... mentioned politicians\n[noise] yeah he said politicians don't read I mean my first response was that was perhaps politicians need to read novels who wants to be better politicians and to be more humane and their policies\nUm that's the beauty of of literature and the beauty of people who can create a canvas of characters that really bring the human condition to the fore and\nListening to him talk just made me so so enthused and excited but again I I I think my response about politicians not meeting that they do need to read more and they need to read novels so that they can become more humane in their policymaking Rona\nSome politicians do read we should remember that President Obama actually it was a great novel reader and that's a wonderful conversation stood on line up with him talking to the Pulitzer Prize winner Marilyn Robin send about ... ... in fact\nThe situation that the president being the interviewer and a novelist thing the interviewee there's also something about land it's very contemporary in China too\nMany peasants being moved off the land there to the cities and one of the major reasons they didn't want to go in many cases is if they lose their right to have that little patch of land that they had that in the countryside\nAnd for Chinese workers it's still birth rate the it to the hall it's rather like Colombians it seems to have some patch of land that's really the\nRub tell this land the land issue is universal isn't it\nIt is absolutely I mean I'm across the continent of Africa where you have a large multinational corporations taking over large fleets of land\nUm and communities being very very up in arms about that and trying to hold their governments accountable um is a testament to the fact that land as culture land is um is everything about who you are as a human being um and the the the tendency to to sort of negate that is really problematic\nAnd everyone now moving to the ... and even the countryside behind I mean\nOut in the countryside in China one ... is that his grandparents and young children who are left in the villages well the study buddy men and women that going out to build a city is so that's

of the ... somewhere in between but we do have\nA full once when your papers in their minds how lucky unlucky we are and they start young you know you can go into schools and children they'll be able to identify the lucky unlucky kids in the classroom and\nSo this is something which is something to do that psychology is an ass signed keep this notion even though it's a rational of being lucky and I'm like [noise]\n... is the idea of luck tied to something that we've been talking about and that's where I got an idea of magical thinking consider yourself lucky you I'm lucky is a form\nOf magical thinking because clearly crossing their fingers ... probably doesn't influence the well directly however well my research shows is is does it affect you mentality of psychology your beliefs you have to choose and they then have an impact on your life\nSo lucky people are most successful the unlucky people they do get to policies and chat with people end up getting job office or they do their best to in life because they're far more positive and that helped me someone drives them for so you know we're white it's rational to be irrational\nRight okay so there is kind of such a thing as lucky unlucky people because lucky unlucky people\nBehave in different ways and all that for influence I Lived in different ways it is that right [noise] yeah yeah I mean my research I spent a decade looking extremely lucky unlucky Pete's about thousands\nOf them and we can save the lucky people were far healthier they tend to have more long lasting relationships are they tend to earn more money or they tend to ... ... certain that sentence yes they're lucky yeah and the average that showed that they were doing things\nOften unconsciously Craig that good luck the way they're thinking the way they're behaving so yes that is like psychology there is a science to lock ... amazing so what kinds of principles these ... or ... people living their lives by some kinds of things were they doing different needs to each other\nOne the key principles is that they are more open to opportunities and so they tend to have a gold Israel will do in terms of being happy and healthy one sack but how they were going to get that well they're very open to different groups through self I met some of the poppy seed and she said well that's an interesting personal keep in touch with that person or that they will go along with that routes\nWhen unlocked the whole are often stuck in a rock that go one way which they intend to be successful in relationships will help for whatever the case and they stick with that no matter what happens so that kind of flexibility\nBehavioral flexibility is very cold this some experiments that you have done the kind of showed what the difference is between the people who identify as white cat a couple of toss based experiments so for example might have to click through a newspaper and\nThey might be opportunities in the newspaper or like big ... saying you know till the experiments you've seen this when a hundred pounds\nAnd the lucky people tend to have quite a large what's called attentional spotlight they're very relaxed and so they said they truly say over the world was spotless opportunities and go out like at my money\nAnd give them the money to not that lucky but still\nThe unlucky people are anxious about themselves right small spotlight did pretty don't see those opportunities lucky people say optimist I think cats are like work out well for them and so because of that they're very Brazilians went bad things happened they will bounce back because this underlying belief in the future good things will will come about\nUnlucky people exactly the opposite pessimistic for example if you give people a scenario such as you walk into a bank to invest a robot like foreign gum and the bullet hit you in the arm you're lucky you I'm lucky you seem\nTo different cities in which white rich people respond slapstick resilience of the lucky

he ... at the beginning of this program we heard how magical police or sometimes the result of our brains making fools connections and getting things from the richest reset seem to show that believing you're lucky can become self fulfilling and actually make you more lucky\nOff to hearing Richards advice maybe I Will try to adopt the mindset of the lucky pests and stop staring at the pavement

normalizing nuke us North Korea relations\nOr it was I was for all go on to Christian or a\nYou know these are actually being done and exchange these measures need to be taken in parallel\nIn a comprehensive manner or because he's told churches and so you could see there are many measures North Korea has already taken it has already return the remains of us soldiers it has already put a moratorium on additional nuclear and missile tests\nAnd has already completely dismantled the only nuclear test site\nIt hasn't ... so furthermore it is also in the process of dismantling the missile engine test side as was the last platform and ...\n... con ...\nIs saying is that subject corresponding measures from the U.S\nIt is ready to take even further additional denuclearization measures in the form of dismantling the nuclear facilities that young soldiers and their own\n... you can see the end of war declare ration is just one of many factors and did question to an end of war declaration as a political statement that expresses that the longstanding hostile relations have ended\nSo once we get this declaration and subject to further progress in denuclearization we will be able to engage in negotiations him to sign a peace treaty and at the very end we will be able to sign this peace treaty ...\nSome unfortunate was hung on me to\nA vote on this is the kinds of

the future of climate and we ended up ... or ... or so of course if we reach a certain point of denuclearization in North Korea\nThen we also need to fiercely thing about relieving sanctions vis a vis

important to recognize the women in science technology engineering and math\nRightly say okay well that's the thoughts with vice allegations over the last week of Chinese hacking off server equipment destined for the big technology companies\nUh Bloomberg investigation has concluded that the Chinese manufacture head and said so vitamins chips and see seven equipment they ended up at the likes of apple Amazon and some US government agencies\nThe organizations have dismissed those claims leaving many to question the evidence underpinning that Bloomberg reports but whatever the truth is off the instant it is an opportunity certainly to us whether such a hack could happen\nAnd just how secure out all the supply chains of crucial computer equipment technology correspondent mark world has been covering this story ... at the BBC\nWell this was the cover story in Bloomberg Businessweek\nAnd it involved a Amazon and apple such as the company's us warships the department of defense enable oil companies organizations that we're using video so it was made by a company called elemental technologies ... and was interested in that company ... getting video this was a few years ago twenty Fifteen I think\nI'm an elemental had to come up with some hardware and software that was great to come pressing video\nI'm the service the elemental was using were made by another company called super microcomputers ink on these computers were assembled in China surprising given you know trying to become a nation of the\nGlobal electronics manufacturing markets and apparently while Amazon was doing some due diligence on the technology is making sure they worked as advertised apparently they tripped over a tiny chip the size of a grain of rice that'd be added to the servers\nAre being made in the Chinese factories and the claim is that the tiny chip has a little ... that effectively can sample anything passing through the ... and has a backdoor that can lead you into any organization that I'm using those machines and that's what's Bloomberg was claiming this week\nHuge ... which was then rapidly denied by Amazon and apple\nThat's right yeah I mean I don't want you to quite a while and genuinely was always very launched tech firms you get really wishy washy statements they hate to say anything definitive but that was striking about these statements how was how detailed they were\nThe language using um an apple boldly said there is no truth in this story Amazon was a little wasn't point so definitive but said it had investigation as well and was really struggling to understand how Bloomberg reached its conclusions\nSo far for us to sit here and onto the kite as to whether the Bloomberg report is true or not I mean is there anything we know about\nHow likely it is to be true either because the blame by half said they put a hold of evidence together obviously that I Would have been very strongly rejected by the ...\nThat's right yeah I think ... it's been investigating twelve months have Seventeen inside his including former spies as those people who have apple and Amazon and\nCertainly if you are a nation state and yeah and you could do something like this they should just be tough I Would because you know it's a growing area video and if it was that ideal by deal with an yet absolutely you'd want to do it but equally young I talked to quite a lot of security companies and they say that you know there's been a big sea change in the white those nation states operate\nLike getting less and less about the big ticket to the operations and that certainly this would have been because\nYou're talking about involving people in a factory you talking about changing a production line you're talking about a lot of people it's a lot of moving parts that to coordinate and you know China may have [noise]\nYou know a a good handle on the loyalties of those people but you got to think at some point someone something someone would get out and it would be more obvious that this had happened\nAnd I and I think that the change that we've seen these ... those ... those nations and now going from which will still the campaigns\nAt that tend to use the kinds of techniques that you see from you know just your standard organized criminal because that makes it much easier to hide where's this is you know each family overseas where are you going to point the finger if something images from a Chinese factory was a sponsorship on it\nAnd that's why as whatever is or isn't going on in this particular story at least it's not what you mean if you
