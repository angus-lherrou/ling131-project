time last for about a few of the thing that I was\nLike I said it's only five thousand people here in Brazil where we took a lot of the class is talking about politics is talking about the system\nHow it works how can be a politician Brazil what is important to know on this election is\nRooted in a kind of ... as he points the nine year old engineer reading her first campaign for Congress

for us to be part of the system in our that you can that we know that it's a lot of chaos here so that's why we new faces with new projects with new ideas have to be part of this in order to change it and what\nDo you think you can do differently in the system that ultimately is very corrupt for everyone I Would\nSay that is very very important to change or electoral system because it only for tax the all politicians I think this must be the focus we have to change that before I before king he everything\nOut but he's not sure that our families\nWho taught me political reform the deaths of corruption and visit in politics is astonishing let's take the twenty sixteen impeachment former president ... set for instance you're hearing the Congress session in the back where\nDoes she barely beat you know the ruling\nAnd opposition parties both the ousted and the new president absolutely everyone was involved in graft scandals half of all five hundred and Thirteen Brazilian and peas in

people who\nCan roll up their sleeves and get things done and the target is the willingness to serve\nSo we believe that we need to bring that back to the table and so people understand that they when they are voting for someone they're hiring someone to do the job that they can do\nBut even if they're very qualified people it's a very tough systems to get in because there's a lot of corruption and those were corrupt to have a lot of advantages in this so can an honest person make it in this world that at least enter politics\nI think they can if you do any research with residents voters would they do essentially give you two answers that they're fed up with the current politicians and that they would like to see new practices and new individuals and we felt we had to start somewhere\nSo

controlling the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nBut they've got all these savers going on and actually outright the buying as well and the going rate was around a hundred

searching\nFor what was the holy grail of ... at the time and material that would he'll ... too large to recover busking graphs\nThe project consisted of having my students and myself synthesize membranes made of substances called partners and we took a very pragmatic approach\nYou ever seen his team used trial of Arab working their way through different chemical family's plastics rubbers textiles fibers tissues from the Baltic the membranes were placed on wounds in the skin of guinea pigs by train technician\nAnd then we waited to see what will happen\nAnd what was the mood amongst you and your team at the beginning of the work well I'm the mood was that of people who are blissfully ignorant\nOf what was going on I had never had any training and wound heating or taking care of losing animals do people neither did any one of my students\nBasically where we're rather ignore a bunch but we had the optimism of people sometimes don't know very much about the problems that are trying to solve\nWhat does the research project stretched into bumps in the years that optimism began to fade\nNone of these membranes had any effect whatsoever on the speed with which so close so we're basically making no progress where we're not learning anything we're we're not coming closer to our goal we were very unhappy\nBy Nineteen Seventy four ... to books have been struggling with the problem for five years yeah this is research ground was about to end and with no progress to show for the money they spent time was running out for him to find something that would work\nAt the end of my row so to speak I decided that we would try courage and membranes and we did and this is where we found out something that told us that we're doing something very wrong what happened was that when his courage and membranes\nWere placed on the animals the wounds just refused to close\nSomehow these membranes of college and appear to be slowing down the speed at which the wound healed when\nHe's collaborated up to ... he was exasperated\nAnd he said Yani we're wasting our time we're going the wrong way so at that point I almost decided to give up my excursion imagination I said Yani urine

at the microscope it slices of tissue that were taken from animals after the experiment was over\nFifty look to the tissue tested with the synthetic polymers membranes you found that way the wound healed over those old Scottish you\nThis was perfectly normal because both animals and we as humans close our wounds with formation of scar\nThat he looked at the tissue from the wound\nCovered with a seemingly counterproductive collision membrane\nI could not see any scarring anymore there was no scar you set up scar there was another kind of tissue\nSkin has to last the ... is the academic ... it's called the ... is professor you're honest took his slide and went to see a friend there was a full of just it was very knowledgeable about skin\nI said look could you help me with this there is some kind of a tissue here it doesn't look like scar but I don't know what else it is\nHe looks to somebody ... said this looks like ... we looked at it again and again and then ask other people and they confirmed that the ... we thought we had the failed the experiment in our hands and that's you know we didn't we had to very successful experiment so it was\nOh you ... come home and then uh it was a moment are right yes but it was a eureka moment was not shared by the majority of my colleagues in the area of medicine or biology\nIt took a long time many years to convince people that this

which we know that Michelle Obama and Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton all worked on\nBut then again if the restriction back home in the U.S is actually contradicting some of these efforts or not actively working to support some of these initiative that I think it's definitely not very helpful is seeking to make this visit I successful\nI'd be how have other first ladies generally been treated
