Jones but bottom and\nRobert Plant were fairly young guys when they got to this band like this is the first big time thing we're in\nAnd you can hear that sort of bravado and that talking is and that you know the usefulness of in that record and you can hear the leather pants yes you can and the way this ban fetish eyes is the details\nOf Led Zeppelin does it it it's kind of fascinating I mean the courtroom immigrants song in Asia man\nThere was a drum splash again you're the one that just I go wherever I heard that before oh it's your time is going to come by living in LA it's apple is that a whole lot of love wailing lover lever take her\nDay of listening to those Led Zeppelin records and absorb them and they're going a couple of layers deep and how they're going to read purpose those sounds for their own purposes\nBut I I think you're also under selling you know let's not forget there's like working man by Russia's and\nWell yeah I mean here's here's part two of this you've got a number of bands in rock history that have done the same thing I mean you can't be a hard rock bands posed apple and we had at least referencing sums up when I Would say\nA ... and I'm Talking about good bans and not so good bands but there's there's definitely a little bit of ... everybody's played metal and hard rock so I Would argue\nAh so you're you know let's think about ... mother was thinking about white snake or maybe we shouldn't think about them too much because our head or kingdom come as exactly these are the bands that have done what Greta Van fleet has done and had momentary success doing it\nBut does anybody care or remember about them ever since I've already forgotten ... another band of brothers I mean I hate to go on about ... ... you know I shouldn't be calling out a ... Greta Van fleet about lyrics because Robert Plant lurks weren't very good early on either he was a young guy really that much about except babe I'm going to ramble\nLike can I can I Do lyrics cause I prepare something special for it in the history of sound opinions we're at what show six hundred and Seventy four I decided I'm going to limit my review or to home that I took from the words of Greta Van fleet itself can I read the dramatic of are are are you ready yeah you're right\nYeah the words you know so well you're in and out of fashion in Hollywood of hell who was the wiser to help us here and what we know when the end is near oh sweet mama lay me down in my grave the wicked shepherd\nChills me down to my soul wash the castle fall and winter takes us all darling you gotta pay any to kiss the sun and fight the fire oh well it chokes the death within the smog it wise where is the music in the darkness way below [laughter]\nSo they ... they don't do the word very well done very well from every song you know what that reminds me of and and I was thinking of this as I was listening in parts of the show my go that's the Jack Black seen a Little Rock where he's telling the kids about the song he wrote and he never quite finished India okay\nA dark stage\nThen the other night and you can see me and my guitar\nDamn near\nNow than in the end of time there was a man who news rude and writing was rich and ...\nThat's a pretty dramatic reading of that song yeah uh I mean that that's what this is what these were these worst I Believe we're inscribed in tablets are held and the darkest steps of more yeah yeah well absolutely and\nI think when these guys grow up maybe we'll see something but right now we we have a ... basically a ... Led Zeppelin tribute band they can't escape that [noise]\n\nSound opinions as always has been produced by Brennan ... laid out of ... and [noise]\nIt is a little quick [laughter] sound opinions does\nGood evening I'm Tracy Schultz you're listening to Austin's NPR station this is Katie Katie HD when often you can find this on line a K. U. T. dot O. R. G. thank you so much\nFor lifting the ten o'clock it's time for the BBC the curious through\n[noise]\nPreviously on everyday Americans\nSome of the ladies that you see laying on the floor or detox\nAnd they're physically sick\nToday are critical of one Kentucky newspapers coverage of the opioid crisis continues\nThere's many other ways around that test\nWhether it's dumping\nWe think Thomas child abuse trauma seeing your mom only in that in front of you and we've had the thing that\nYou cannot get emotionally involved\nThey issue and the magnitude of it here is so great that it would\nBe that's happened swallow I I'm just a mom\nI Want to say I want people to stop dying and I don't think that's too much that\nEveryday Americans on the b._b._c. World Service to the news\nIt's a story about pain patients who say they're the un Vernon victims of the opioid crisis and some of them have just searing unrelenting pain and for a variety of ailments and\nThey say that the reduction our nation's having on the opioids could limit the pain medicine they need to live ... lives\nIt's just very um [noise]\nYou know sad and an aspect of the crisis I haven't really thought about enough so I'm hoping that readers will respond to it\n\nLike man I'm\nPutting them into her ... term giving them a medium care for Russia to the helicopter\nOr Martin Zucker I'm a faculty member with the department of emergency medicine here though so I train residents and took care of patients you treat quite a few overdoses about three a day [noise] you know it's such\nA spectrum sometimes someone gets reversed right here you know family roles might have a car we put them in here we given the medicine and five minutes later they're happy they're normal no lasting damage and it's a great intervention point like hey you you almost died you would have died a few didn't make it here\nAnd so let's make some changes in your life will help you but uh you know other people it's not not so happy when we you know we don't get them back\nOr um during my mind\nAs far as oh good related visits that can happen any time of day but we do see more of those in the evening at night time will do in a [noise]\nYour proper here [noise]\nI'm pretty progressive about ... news non opioids for pain relief as much as I can now too fractured her thigh bone sticking out of your skin will generally used ... for smaller fractures you broke your hand you broke your food or your toe I personally don't send them out with any opioid pills\nBut that's tough for patients to get upset with you about that and we want to treat pain I'm you know we but we have to explain to some people you're going to have pain\nI Can't take your pain down to a zero sum of that's to be expected and so what we want to do is make a tolerable and let you cope through it so that you don't have a long term issue out of this I just heard a statistic that\nI prescribe opioids after being admitted for a car wreck is what they quoted updated about ten percent chance are still being on opioids a year later so if I'm looking at and that this is people at MIT and so they're pretty sick they had some major injuries but\nIf I think every time I prescribe pills for that person on their way out there's one out of ten is going to be still on them a year later you know you've got to think twice about that [noise]\n\nI I envy to Morgan I'm the director of community impact for the Courier Journal\nShe's my awesome boss and I am the boss of best Warren yeah it covers extensively the opioid crisis here\nIn law and Kentucky so we're looking at saying something like I think we're gonna have\nTo crack down on drugs um as opposed to opioids so that we can use it in a quote back what do you think\nWell what do you mean because I thought more people do note of egos are these days and it really specifically to crack down on up you\nKnow what yeah what I meant was we had opioids it was either I'd take opioids or kill myself I don't like long term medication which we that's what she said I Know we don't have to put that part unquote that right we can just take opioids clothes or I'd kill myself that's the way of doing All right All right a partial quote yet either I take opioids\nOr kill myself and then that way we can call it cracked down on drugs pain pills pain hope yeah crack down on pain pills words to me All right I got up to fix this\nOkay crackdown\nOn drug sleeves in patients on edge either I think a lot of the lights or I feel my stuff\nYeah I think that's good enough yeah I Would agree that okay ...\n... ... ... ... ...\n... well\nHey I'm Alison Ross with the Courier Journal\nAnd we're at butler high school in Jefferson County Kentucky\nWhere at the end of a very long call way to get to marry worst\nClassroom she is it health teacher here that we were working on a story right now taking a look at suspensions and are we hearing a lot about you know trauma really causing some behavior problems in some schools right now we're looking more at the elementary level but you know looking across the board as well now I Know you've got really good reports\nYour kids are you seeing you know just school wide or even hearing from other colleagues that other schools about more behavior issues because that that might be tied back to some of the trauma going on at home with the drug issue\nThese kids come in here with real\nLife issues and a lot of it revolves around drugs drug use drug addiction and there's a lot of trauma you know we think traumas child abuse trauma seeing your mom oldie in down in front of ya and we've had students at the thing that\nWe had a student at pool to a couple a couple of years ago young man that his uncle died in front of him and he's he's the one that took the needle out of his arm\nThat's trauma I mean I see these students every day but look in their eyes every single day\nNow I you know what the kids are living in their cars or the kids are there going without food because the money is being used for drugs now we had a last year and a few other teachers bought a food cart for a child because there is no food in the house he date rama noodles and catch up\nAnytime he wasn't at school that's what he was eating and it was because step dad was a drug addict and all the money was going out for drugs\nMarried we we talk a lot about in education are reporting in education about high stakes tests\nAnd like you know how critical things like math and reading are you had some high stakes\nAre high stakes our life and death or the tests are important academics are important math and science are born but when we're doing health education\nIf we're not getting to those kids and there are a dying by suicide or a drug overdose at Nineteen methods and English don't matter in the state of Kentucky unfortunately health\nIs only required one semester in high school that's it it's just alarming to me that comprehensive health education drug education if not across the board all the way through the state of Kentucky [noise]\nUm [noise] the is that we get emotional so many of our kids come in and they feel hopeless because this is what they're living this is what they're saying so not only is a critical that we educate them not just about drugs an addiction that they've got to have hope because a lot of them were helpless they feel helpless ...\n... ...\n[noise]\nHey how's it going\nThere says Rachel or take is on the breaking news editor\nToday is September Eighteenth it's

the allegations in here and I've got to flush it out this is an FBI agent\nHis one statement unfortunately they use initials for the key witnesses and I'm going to have to try to find them which will be a little difficult so I'm really I'm at the early stages of just using this document as a launch pad\nTo try to see how I can flushed this out and see where it takes me\n\nUm detective bath roof with Louisville metro police narcotics division that prescription diversion unit we work with any type of illegal prescription diversion we also investigate prescribe are that are over prescribing really anything involving any type of illegal prescription drug\nWe have ongoing investigations and the difficult part of prescribe or investigations is they're very lengthy and they're very labor intensive\nOur hope when any of these happen is to get the person's prescribing rights and to get their medical license suspended during the length of the investigation\nUnfortunately a lot of the addicts that we work with we do try to help them but it\nYou cannot get emotionally involved because it is that the issue and then the magnitude of it here is so great that it will eat us up and swallow is whole if we get too emotionally involved we have to do what we can to help and if we're unable to help we have to move on and just continue to do our job and\nFor me [noise] the thing that I find the most rewarding is if there are physicians who are preying on their patients who are addicts\nI find it very rewarding to make sure that they can't prescribe make sure that they're not able to treat patient that's the way that I feel like I can help the most and not it not be detrimental to my own personal wellbeing\nI'm Emily Walden a mother that lost my dear son TJ six years ago and like many other parents that have faced this tragedy I Want to make sure that does not happen to anyone else [noise]\nAlthough she is quite the campaign or in like very passionate about that I think

World Service it's hard to talk with me Stephen ... Afghans will have to wait until next month to get the results of last Sunday's parliamentary election\nBut in one sense the verdict is already in the ballot again exposed widespread insecurity and the actions of government control in many parts of the country my guest today is president Ashraf Ghani has recently appointed and strikingly young\nNational security advisor having below well hey\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is that changed country as a result of your investment\nThat's how we do a lot more ... on Hong talk often the news\nWe had some technical issues on day one um but it was repeated an unfortunate too was provided station and we had well actions on the second day\nYou're you're giving me a plenty of of the title but I feel that you're not addressing my main point my main point really is a very simple one how come\nSeventeen years after the Taliban government was toppled how come that Afghanistan has never been seen as secure in those Seventeen years as it is today\nWell that's the perception issue that's when you think ... what makes no no no no with respect has on why laying table and I was\nA whole host of independent analysis including from the U.S government as well they all think and it's backed by figures figures on the amount of territory that is now controlled all operated in with impunity by the Taliban\nIt when when we talk of control we have to have a definition of what that means if control mean providing governance and services to the people\nThen I don't think that's what the Taliban provide if it's fear yes that exists and we are at war Steven we we're not denying that we're at war in a ... a witness Audubon into twenty of so terrorist groups that operate\nA because of the instability that the Taliban provide a ... I asked for calling a ... and and making it sound like it is all falling apart I think we're not looking at the detail in this matter one\nHas to look a lot closer than just the mere headline I Do not really what the situation in on that transformed country I Am\nPainfully aware that it's very it's easy for me I Would ... missed my ground you're easy for me to sit in London and tell you about the situation in your country and\nSound as though I'm being extraordinarily arrogant I Do not mean to do that but I Do wish to ask you a very direct question you all the government's national security advisor\nThere are experts on security in Afghanistan who say that if you drive an hour in any direction\nFrom the capital Kabul it will in effect put you in Taliban Tara treated quite well next but actually Jackson in foreign policy magazine he says they may not be a Taliban flag flying but every one will know who is in charge the Taliban may can enforce the rules they collect taxes\nThey decide how much of a president's the state government can retain is that true or not\nIt's not ... there are areas there are districts where there are a ... where Taliban are collecting taxes and they are\nAre benefiting from illegal minds and they are a ... exploiting a in a in the businesses in the areas are from the jungles illegal logging in the likes of criminal activities that they are engaged in\nA but to say that they control those areas is I think a a very big exaggeration yes they can drive fear into people in those areas they can they can get ... they they will be able to kidnap and there'll be able to attack people but do they govern those areas I think that there is has to be a distinction between does\nWell if you're telling me is it popular now yeah every inch of the country yes yeah is it possible to man\nEvery inch of the country no do you know but no country does that but to be able to bring the ah the population centers the Afghan population central under control and provide them with security is an effort that we are a than we have that we've been working on and are not working\nWell Lance or even for the areas where there is a there is in security so that I have the support of the people in New solutions to uh to bring stability to those areas and security for the people I I understand your ... do you I understand you're working\nOn the challenges and the challenges are real just explained to me if you can because you all the president's national security advisor as over the last few months explained to me why\nAccording to the Pentagon inspector general the civilian death toll in Afghanistan has reached a new record high in recent months the last year\nWhy is it that the trajectory is it in the wrong direction and the the most important function of any government that is protecting civilians your government cannot achieve\n... where we are under attack as the space for the insurgents grew smaller and they're not able to launch the kind of attacks they wanted to to take territory in two thousand fourteen after the international security forces the majority of the un to national security forces left\nOr they try to take territory and that has been there a strategic objective but they failed they could take it could not maintain so this the tactics which two attacks in cities in populated areas\nTo bring

the plastics drew a little bit wider than that but it's an example of something that could be consigned to history and European Union countries soon on Wednesday the European Parliament voted in favor of a ban on single use plastic products\nThat would apply to such items is draws plates ... costs in ... which make up more than Seventy percent of waste material in the world's oceans other plastics such as drink bottles will have to be collected separately and recycled at a rate of Ninety percent by twenty twenty five on the ... law\nSpeaking during the debate before the vote the Irish any ... look ... look men Flanagan described encountering his first plastic capturing the Nineteen seventies and he said nobody thought then that it will prove to be such a threat to the environment\nAt the time we were worried our main worry on this planet wasn't new care Holocaust nature we realized that the plastic far as food that I had in my hand was actually going to turn out to be more dangerous and I said that now even with who we have in the White House\nBy twenty fifty there will be more plastic in the oceans and there are fish by weighs a hundred and turkey different Marines theses known twice ingested plastic\nCould have been like this work elsewhere in the world specifically could work in the U.S Peter Morici is an American economist and business professor at the University of Maryland I asked him if he welcomed the legislation from the European Parliament\nI'm a little puzzled as to what the objective is if it's to reduce carbon that's fine but you have to consider that a sweeping ban\nMay cause producers are manufacturers to come up with solutions that are even\nMore harmful to the environment ... airplanes there's a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal or some kind also and takes resources to make that metal just like it doesn't last night and takes energy\nAnd it's heavier as a consequence that may cause the airplane thing get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around a metal a knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one that doing the wrong thing or they\nOh I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right across the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhile it's not out right is it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throwing it in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single used plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived with them surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of a bottles in the United states had about twenty five years while there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to scrimp those bottles up and use them again it's not a single use plastics you should be used\nAnd it's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nAnd what we need actually in Nigeria is not necessarily a reduced population but redistribution of wealth and natural resources\nAn ... and an economy encouraged to grow in a way that reduces inequality while and mitigate against in my ... is environmentally sustainable\nThanks a Danish government bill aimed forcing parents to put that toddlers in day care if they live in height immigrants neighborhoods is progressing through parliament berets face little opposition in part because they carry the norm even very young children in Denmark the idea\nIs to improve integration by making sure that all children learn the language of the country they live in but as John Lawrence

I just got back from two weeks and ... and this is a research study conducted by Adelphi funded by U. N. D.

Maine full so some years you have lots of rain that other years you have less rain of course that's normal and has been going on for a long time but actually the valuable if he has increased in recent years\nWe've also seen increased heat increase speeds of wins and then changes in the lake Chad itself which is this wonderful um Liesl if the people in the sponsor the wild\nOn on a who a lot of livelihoods depend on before the conflicts that we've been seeing in the region people are adopting in coping to these changes when it came to the climate but actually the conflict the combination of the conflict on climate change has reduced people's ability to adapt and this was really striking ...\nLamb due to climate change people's land was normal at that time is it had been before and so people move towards like chance whether ... file to graze the bomb and and also to fish but they fight over those areas\nBut yes exactly and unfortunately now with the conflict that has been declared

are now moving back to areas that was not that's not enough of that practices when they move ten Twenty years ago and then having to cope somehow\nIt's also affected relationships within and between communities I've spoken to a lot of women and all four countries who've talked about the high number of divorces that that thing and that communities because men are not able to take care of that families in the context of ...\nBeing a husband means we've also seen conflict of natural resources and access to land and what's\nFor example in Nigeria whack contract between palm is I'm a journalist has increased in both incidents in scope and whereas\nBefore you know if I'm a person with that cows would accidentally eat someone's cops that will waste to deal with that\nBut as the number of instance has grown those natural conflict resolution mechanisms have really weakens and we've also seen a depressed livelihoods in a context you now have um deposition groups not use

that I co edited a which is published at the CIA together with my co edited does he know Mohammed and ... and we had a panel on friday talking about Clinton is I'm In Nigeria\nWith greatness as he put it in Nigeria homosexuality is illegal isn't it\nAnd say yes sets in session sexual acts are legal and as well as the vegetation and oppression of gay clubs and societies\nOn same sex marriage and

great to see how the festival has changed in this regard I remember the stuff that's what I had when he was in twenty four team from that you had\nAnd people making intensely homophobic statements to audience applause\nAnd then you had a number of years led the organizers quite consciously I think\nHad panels on Quinn is interviews with ... women working with algae the organizations like the initiative for equal rights and and here the atmosphere was still a bit combat says with lots of questions and questioning from the audience\nIs there a little against promoting homosexuality is the government of some governments put it in Nigeria in which case you might have full and found that just discussing the issue\n[noise] well and then the little actually talks about promotion and operation of gay clubs in societies and\nI Would say that promoting homosexuality as he puts it and any such legislation against that would actually infringe freedom of expression which is guaranteed by the nature and constitution and but in the end by his panel was the room was just filled with positivity and warmth\nAnd I've been really moved by the number of people who've come up to me and my ...\nAnd that really excited about the book\nUm and really wanting to start having these conversations in ninth Jan\nAnd I think we also need to see that and the contacts of changes in the culture

vote is in the state of area\nDeprived Mrs ... conservative policy partner rather the sea su policy of its traditional majority that we'll we'll talk to our correspondent in building Damien McGinnis\nDamian what are the big issues in today's age\nWell as you say oh this is a regional election but in fact as being seen as a referendum a certain extent and I go to ... national government votes of density and it failed hasn't already to interrupt you all sorry I lost the whole thing on the votes of destiny\nExactly that's what people are calling it I'm not really because ah both of them don't necessarily in that region dissatisfied because the economy's doing well\nThe regional governments is is pretty popular actually but what we've seen across Germany and the national government is a series of spots squabbles between the two main government policies and coalitions ...\nOn the fence a left STD on these crises that have been response by personality classes to certain extent I really irritated versus across Germany that's sick of seeing politicians in Berlin squabbling among themselves say what we could see today\nIs versus in ... in this region punishing the two main governing policies up in Berlin which has nothing to do reading the reach of with the region but this means that it could be a big problem for the two main governing policies across Germany because if I'm going to medical conservatives do about the un has so\n[noise] well this wasn't exercising explicit exercise in listening and that's what Obama would and he did he told me you know that kind of was that the the core of his political floss\nFaith that this is how democracies are built in his mind that listening is the key to building a relationship to building a community to building ultimately a country this kind of exchange of ideas in a democracy depends on it and that's what these letters for for this was his attempt to keep listening\nOkay so we listened did he change policy based on any of the lessons was he re persuaded issues\nYou can follow trends certainly you can see for example with el GB teach you writes a lot of the early now coming forward with like\nHey why are we allowed to get married why's my grandfather not allowed to marry this man he's been with his whole life a lot of that stuff or why am I why am I not allowed to reveal that I'm not a gay soldier\nThat stuff early on the kind of constant drumbeat of that which was not really a a conversation we were having an America explicitly the way that it was happening in the mail\nAnd then you see policy start changing now was it directly because a letter I don't think you could ever say that but you could sort of trace these trends definitely\nPresident Obama didn't make a big deal of this reading this habit that he that he followed every single loss of his presidency but he likes that you were writing about it now definitely\nYou know what he he seemed to be glad about that I think um [noise]\nThe people who were working in the mail room so many of them were young um who had started with him during his campaign knocking on doors\nYou know this kind of like set off to to talk to regular folks and knock on their doors and they were still there and they were answering the mail and they were reading the mail\nAnd that piece of it I think he found really touching and like important that people knew\nSomething peculiar American back writing to the president the optimism that they really have an impact\nYou know I hear that when I talk about this book outside of the U. S. I hear that often and it's it's so striking to me I I I Believe it is because I think that we have this naive kind of like\nSense of you know that we matter that we that we shouldn't matter to our elected officials and here's the president is saying yes you do I think that I don't know that a lot of other\nCountries have that sense that sense of entitlement probably thought\nIs that how you see it maybe [laughter] Jeanne Marie Laskas her book is called to a bomb or with love joy hate and despair quite interesting that the American talked to his with love joy anger and hope\nTo publish was still to British ... could take something DACA or we could talk about Obama's legacy should try and Matthew and I imagine that you'll speaking glowing terms about that let's start with the importance of lead is listening to their citizens Chitra\nYes absolutely and I read the New York times article that that is young marine ask us votes um which she then they invest into a book and I was really struck\nBy how President Obama took the time every single day to reach tend to let the which ... and think about them which is really an incredible actually thinking about how busy someone is in that I'm In that an office\nAnd and it's of course it's important to remember that the Obama administration wasn't perfect and especially the number of drone strikes that will open a and that will authorized um some of the policies and practices around immigration and it's easy to look back within the sounds yet to another way of governing but I Do think\nThat this whole um practice of reading the left is just shows the grace and the empathy that Obama exhibited and attempting to try and bring the coming of the country together\nAnd trying to engage in all sectors of the population including those who did not vote for him and specifically seeking out those news to try and understand\nAnd not just have to face which of course is very different from what we're seeing now by the current occupant\nYeah I'm not sure that as opposed to Mr Trump ... which would see that in such glowing terms reflecting on Mr Obama but how important do you think it is generally messed you to take the mail from people who voted for you didn't vote for you\n... I'm Still reeling from ... from the ... talking about he's had these ... ended up and they'll show quite why we picked out example but it was I thought it was just an eloquent be worse than the idea that he could explain his hands with soap callously could explode ... his voice fine yeah I mean and then ... costing them in ... was ... [laughter]\nBut I mean I think on the on the board of not only are they were also pro I said you know it must have been amazing when you were sitting there was one of his assistants going for I mean they took about a mile back I'm assuming that all these ... but it must be the icing to find these gold nuggets occasionally from time to talk\nHe mocked um kid's homework occasionally there was that there was an example of saying\nPretty good you went on this federal law and keep it up but it was yeah talk show and can you imagine being one of the recipients of one of those ten lessons you wouldn't lose it would you you would never forget that I\nMean of course you know the the question is how did that affect policy and it was fascinating that that she seemed that it did affect policy on on Sunday maybe possibly\nBut I still see I I think you know we live at a time when so many people feel so dissed empowered by their political systems and I'm Talking about in western democracies as much as anywhere else\nAnd and the idea that there's like that kind of spirit of individual connection between ruler and ruled it is something very very ... I was in ... by the fact that obviously lots of rice has\nSwords there was a real possibility that the president would read that led to I I Would tend to something to to read them I wouldn't pendant reason but I actually but if I were dependent something to reason why I Would absolutely going if you would never be read I have no faith whatsoever in that happening would you if you read such a lesser in Nigeria\nNo of course um I think yes and I think that it's something that's very particular about the U. S. mindset icon actually still comprehend that people actually thought that the president would read that letter um yeah\nI like it would be limited to learn either to end our title of the book ends in despair and that is ending hope\nSays it old man who maybe that's why I I'm ... I'm Still going back to your comment about the reason why I buy mentioning her dressing up in disguise ... and ... Singh Britain's tried to walk out of the people [laughter] right and also home [laughter] I Know\nI Do know politicians in the u._k. undid Nigeria who read that treats the dimensions that they get on with the\nCity yeah I'm an ego thing you might read tweets about you because you can't you know come back and not to look at them in case I say something nice\nYeah but come on politicians mostly it's not nice the the comments that they get as well\n...

far right politician he was not an outsider as Donald Trump\nBut he has been in Congress for the last twenty eight years but he was not so much well known for his proposals for bills that he managed to approving Congress he was much more well known for these highly controversial remarks\nThat he made on such a number of topics like we meant the community and the military rule in Brazil he's suffering since that he would rather have a that some that are gay son he said that he would not pay the same salary to a woman as a man and he said but the biggest mistake of Brazil's dictatorship\nWhich lost it for Twenty one years in Brazil was the fact that they tortured and killed their political opponents\nThis election is weird to many outside observers teddy principally why this is this is just an opinion we've got Lula da Silva former president and leader of the Workers Party who is in prison if he will not be in prison we know that he would almost certainly when the ... election\nSo the fact that so much support has gone to ... ... means that many people who are keen supporters of the former president and the workers policy have switched to the opposite end of the political spectrum almost overnight\nYeah true well there are a number of things that we have to understand first of all Lula had to drop out of the race because he was buried for for running for elections these here because uh because of Brazil stopped electoral court we must remember that he was arrested\nAnd then he couldn't run for re elected to the election was again so are his vice
