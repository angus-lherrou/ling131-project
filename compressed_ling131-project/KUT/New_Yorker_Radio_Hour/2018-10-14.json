me tell me a little bit of a whistle down when they have this album came to be what ... what you want it to be it seems to mirror in some way your very first record that in some ways the recount yeah\nDoes it mean to start the very first thought about it was some kind of book end because I had already started thinking about oh I Know pretty much winding down um it's like the first album it's um simple there's certainly a hint of social consciousness in it\nUm they're pretty songs couple of them were written for me um I think the depths of it comes from the two songs which actually listening today one of them is another world and the other as the president saying amazing grace because those are the powerhouses of songs and without those it would have\nAnd really beautiful album but wouldn't have the depths that it has\n... how do you feel about songwriting as opposed to doing covers lately is it more interesting to you to do covers well first of\nAll you have to know that I quit songwriting about over twenty five years ago and I quit it quit quit quit yeah the channeling or whatever is going on just stop and Rob I mean I didn't really want to go to round Robin learn how to write songs [laughter]\nYou know I I I just at that point started doing everybody else's music and that's what I've done since\nThat was that was a devastating in a way that you felt you weren't the songs were not coming from wherever they come\nTo realize it until I had written some a couple of are so bad it has any time to move on yeah that's it yeah I mean when I wrote and I wrote poetry for a lot of years that stopped as well so now I paint and I think that's going to stick\nYou do mhm is that is that what you're doing the most of your days is panic when I'm home yeah mhm\nYou seem to be doing a lot of listening to and a lot of listening went into this record new meeting with contemporary artists who are a good deal younger than you don't like having to me as well um and the first song that you're going to perform is another world and it's by performing in a known it could tell me a little bit about her\nWell I don't know her personally we tax now a little bit\nShe seems very spiritual and you know her life is deeply meaningful to her and the song is deeply meaningful to me somebody wrote down all of my thoughts and simple song that's what it feels like exactly\nSo why don't we one of your\nWay into that sort of thing [laughter] okay this is another world [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nMy knees and know the play\nAnd will they beat the\nNeed another well\nThis one

another\nAnother way\nOr another\n[noise]\n\nWho's the beauty of beauty isn't it you do you ever ... you say you were texting within only about the songs that they do how much do you tease out what the song is about\nHistory so I look I steeped in this stuff I read your your book in in ... especially in the first appearance in handy when you tour together and then he very painfully pushes your way behavior was\nAwful yeah I was pretty awful yeah and ... and ... and and your tone in that book which is written in the mid to late eighties is is still really\nBetter I mean I held on that for a long time um and then you know recently said some nice things about me that's nice but that isn't what triggered ... just saying okay yes drop all this there was two beautiful what we got from him um he doesn't matter he wrote us our arsenal\nAnd then we went on and did the work [noise] um\nWhat do you do about old songs that are particularly hard to say you just junk them or or or find new ways to finesse them\nWell I my brilliant sound man said because I was grumbling I couldn't do forever young anymore because I Love it because of the top because of the top he said well let grace to it you know the woman who to my guitar as this woman who sings with me just fantastic boy says she can hit all the notes that I used to be able to hit\nShe's out on stage with the sting you and your knowledge\n[laughter] she's out on stage me yeah we took her out of the box and put her on either side effects and she said it's beautiful I mean we've we've turned it into an encore 'cause it's so special she takes that note that I'll you know never ever be making ... ...\nAre there moments when something breaks through or whereas or the or is it just a physiological thing you can't go above ... and don't even try\nUm there is a thing called cellular memory and there are some songs that I can do now is mostly from selling memory for example a swing low I still this Anglo um and it's a different sound when I go up to hit that note but it's still\nSomething I couldn't get to and sustain a lot of things a lot of us know so I can get to but I Can't stay in his eye popping backed down the batter an awful lot like being an athlete you know it's the muscle and then after a while you're not going to be able to do that anymore\nOr you just as happy not doing this\nMhm [noise] I Am not you mean the the work and the local stuff [noise] yeah um you know it's\nAbout seven years ago and I was hoping 'cause I was having such a hard time with the voice I thought well I'll go and see some ear nose and throat guy maybe he'll say I've got no dollar from ... vocal cord mastered I'll be perfect yeah any poked around early you know he put the thing now\nSo we watched on the screen and I\nSaid well is this kind of it you said you're exactly where she'd be Seventy one I said oh that's a shame and I think that if I start training I mean like Judy Collins she's still ... holes those notes up there how did she do that I think she trained really early and trying classically\nI joke with her that she could make notes that I never dream of making yeah right\nAnd whereas I think Joni Mitchell the voice started changing really\nEarly early yeah I think so too\n[noise] so you've got a you've got two nights you got to to be conscious friday and Saturday Night this this this week I think it's fair to say and um how do you prepare for something like\nWell I'm already prepared from this to her that there is nothing I fret about you don't get nervous I'm not really so\nSo you know and have dreams like oh you you wake up in the middle night with a in a terrorist threat or you've forgotten the lyrics to diamonds in\nRussia or something you know I have several times it just makes
