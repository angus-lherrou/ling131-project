{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "Well the department of homeland security came in when they heard of some problems what's funny is that Kobach had hoped to head the department of homeland security he interviewed with President Trump about it\nBut now that agency is in his state looking at cross check and this leads us to a woman named Anita ... she's from Kansas she has a computer science degree and she is appointed herself the cross check watchdog\nShe sounds kind of like losing limb the cyber security expert in Georgia who raised the alarm there\nRight well like lamb I Need to parse it did stumble across some very sensitive data she's a stay at home mom she lives in an affluent neighborhood in the Kansas City suburbs and that's where I visited her this summer she told me she's become obsessed with cross check\nI nearly got kicked out of a New Year's party because I wouldn't sell going all not bad [laughter]\nYou know people I Know where\nShe is tenacious she's on Twitter she's calling reporters she's finally public records requests she's talking to and the buddy who will listen so in June twenty Seventeen when Kobach is head of Trump's election integrity commission\nSent letters to all fifty states asking for them to turn over their voter rolls and ... was prepared\nOne day last June I'm headed out the door to do some errands and I happened to notice a request for data and Twitter is just a gas and\nStop put down my that isn't the entire day saying if you're worried about this you should know your state has been doing this they have been sending the data to Kansas and I over and over and over to the point where I finally just copied\nIt and was just pasting in response to people so much that day that I got shut out of Twitter for looking like a lot [laughter]\nThat that sounds about right with Twitter that like actual human beings should do\nIt I mean it's kind of funny but she really accomplished something her\nEfforts put crushed chicken news and the department of homeland security has checked into the breach is cross check it shut down this year and other states have gotten the message on that some have dropped out of cross checked\nBecause of the security problems that indeed uncovered um she did this by making public records requests to the state of Florida she got sensitive data on nine hundred and forty five\n... including parts of their Social Security numbers and the encryption passwords for the cross check system\nIf we were bad people we could've sold access in a heartbeat for a ton of money a hundred million people's private data\nCould have been we had a key and we had the address we had them both and we could have done all sorts of crap and what we did was but they started this so they fix it\nInitially people worried across jak would be used to purge even more voters especially minority voters but I really didn't find evidence of that nor did need she actually change the narrative about cross check because she figured out that the system that's\nSupposed to help states clean up the voter rolls\nThat what is actually doing is exposing voters personal information\nIt's a sinister marketing effort probably more than anything else\nBut that still hasn't made Kobach give up on cross check\nAnd his campaign to market this idea of voter fraud Kobach is fighting and losing his battle\nAgainst is made up problem of voter fraud in federal court no less weight why was he in federal court\nComic likes to say that he's the ACLU worst nightmare like that clip you played but it's really the other way around the ACLU is really kind of coal box worst nightmare he lost I very public battle to them this summer\nWhen a federal judge overturned Kansas is voter id law\nThat requires you to show proof of citizenship an id in order to vote like a birth certificate or a passport or driver's license\nAnd a federal judge said Kobach not only did not make his case\nThat there's lots of this fraud this judge Julie Robinson said the Kobach showed willful failure in obeying her rulings and his performance in court was so bad that this judge ordered him to take a refresher course in basic civil procedure even though I'm not used to be a law school professor\nAnd need a partial was there in the court house for the trial\nOh my God I Wish more people had been there for a first trial in at at all I mean I don't think you usually get the kind of laugh track that that I had a person like\nI couldn't really watch Seinfeld very easily because George embarrassed me so much I Will be like\nA guy like her and she was still crunchy either duck sometimes it was so that\nYou go to a trial you're unprepared your fumbling you're embarrassing you get correct in multiple times you fail to prove your case in any way\nThat is bad your critics for bears for you\nRight but here's the thing politically this did not hurt Kobach he went on to win the Republican primary for governor this summer by just if you vote here he is on the campaign trail\n[noise] [noise] I Want to do for what President Trump has done for America [noise]\nI interviewed him in the summer he told me that if he's elected he plans to keep on fighting this opposing voter fraud because the thing is is this is working for him\nEven though he was humiliated in court his federal commission was disbanded having achieved nothing the department of homeland security crackdown on cross check but he still may become governor of Kansas thanks in part because his crusade that he's lead against the problems that doesn't really exist\nThat is a record that speaks for itself thanks very thank you Alice my pleasure\nThose big yellow of case you are in Kansas City\nEarlier this month President Trump was in Topeka campaigning for Kobach\nAnd I want to introduce the next governor of Kansas\nAt the same rally Kobach brought up you get voted for\nHe bragged about the voter id law he passed thing that says this is the most secure election\nLaws in America we didn't mention the federal judge turned that law in June [noise]\nThis week shows in partnership with Casey you are

I'm David right\nEarlier this month with the New Yorker festival our weekend long bonanza of interviews and live with it\nSally ate sat down with the legal analysts Jeffrey to\nUse as a former deputy attorney general and she served in the Republican and democratic presidents\nAnd now she's emerged as prominent critic of the Trump Administration\nAnd her name is being whispered\nAs a possible candidate for high oh no that's a possibility is usually down plays\nWhich he has been shut down entirely\nHere's Jeffrey ... been a staff writer at the New Yorker\n\nSally was born and raised in Atlanta Georgia she went to the University of Georgia she went to the University of Georgia law school and in Nineteen eighty nine she became an assistant us attorney or in the city of Atlanta\nShe prosecuted a lot of big cases including Eric Rudolph who was the white supremacist to bomb the Nineteen eighty six uh Olympics and in two thousand ten\nPresident Obama appointed a Sally the U.S attorney in a in the northern district of Georgia which is Elana and in two thousand Fifteen she was confirmed as deputy attorney general of the United states\nAnd on January twenty of two thousand Seventeen briefly but eventually she became the attorney general of the United states and that's where our story is going to start January twenty two thousand Seventeen where were you what\nHappened well I was you're right I was serving as deputy attorney general and there is a tradition at the department of justice\nThat in the transition Tom and administration said deputy attorney general of the prior administration serves as the acting AG for the incoming administration\nUm to to maintain continuity you know to important in any agency particularly the OJ but there's another tradition as well which is nothing happens during that time\nMy chief of staff told me I Would have nothing to do so there would be plenty of time for in her words long boozy lunches [noise]\nUm okay on January twenty four four days later Michael Flynn the incoming national security advisor was interviewed by the FBI the next day the twenty fifth the FBI came to you\nAt this seems like a lifetime I Know I Know it's ancient history but you yeah trust me\nYeah okay okay um\nWell an issue had arisen with respect to sanctions that President Obama had imposed and that actually had been had strong bipartisan support on sanctions against the Russians\nBased on their interference in our election and um it was very strange that despite the imposition of the sanctions the Russians didn't do anything in response and so the intel community was trying to figure that out\nAnd then the course of that discovered\nThat Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions but then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that the Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing\nThis is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's it's a black male so what is what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel hum and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president have been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he has assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so\nYou got the VP out there saying this step so we told 'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nNow he seems determined to undermine the legitimacy of the department and the FBI and anybody else who is involved with the Russia probe I believed to de legitimize any findings from that pro it's it's certainly elevating himself\nAnd being willing to pare down critical democratic institutions for self protection\nUm what about um the role of Rod Rosenstein Rosenstein\nDefinitely has raised the profile of the attorney general you thought you were famous Rod Rosenstein is maybe the most famous our in America he he is because the attorney general sessions has recused um\nHe is the supervisor of them all our investigation how do you think Rosenstein is handled that\nI think he's done a really good job of that um I think you've known Rosen some yeah new and back when we were U.S attorneys together and the Obama administration and so I've known rod\nFor a long time and like I Know everybody for a while was so focused on making sure that we protect Robert Mueller\nAnd goodness knows I think we need to protect Bob Mueller but it's equally as important to protect Rod Rosenstein right now because he really has control over what ultimately happened in this investigation\nI mean in fact the report that Mohler writes doesn't go to Congress\nIt goes to the deputy it goes to his supervisor who was the deputy attorney general so you could have a deputy attorney general who receives the report and says thank you very much puts it in a drawer and that's the end of the story\nAnd that certainly seems to be the course that our president would think that that person ...\nWell it does seem like a I mean the president has all but\nWritten on a wall\nBut he's going to fire the attorney general after the midterms and do you think it's going to fire Rosenstein to\n... you know far be it for me to get in Donald Trump's had a nice walk them both up to the guillotine multiple times now only to then pulled back\nUm so it's hard to know if it's one or the other or he does it in a swim for neither and he just continues to torture them [noise] um it's it's kinda hard to know which whatever I think he thinks will be best for him\nI'm the president appoints the attorney general is he the president's lawyer is he the\nLawyer what's what's what is the role and what's the relation\nTrip what should it be because it's it's not a simple thing now in ... and and I get that a lot of people might look and say look the department of justice is part of the executive branch just like the department of agriculture commerce or any of the other agencies and you answered the president or the president's lawyer that is so not true and\nI remember actually when I first became us attorney and we all went to the White House for what was essentially a photo op I'm with Eric Holder the attorney general then and you know we're all lined up in the bleachers in the East Room there for the president to come in and and\nYou know he comes in and and he looked at us there and said look\nI as a pointed each and every one of you and I know you're going to do a great job but there's only one thing you need to remember and that is you don't represent me\nYou represent the people of the United states and as long as you remember\nThat [noise]\nThey're going to do your job and everything's going to be OK so two thousand nine yeah\nMe read you I'm ...\nI'm from from President Trump um which which relates a little into the criminal justice or dementia I'm very sad that the FBI missed all the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter this was the Parkland shooting a high school\nA vicious not acceptable\nThey are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign there is no conclusion get back to the basics and make us all proud\nI I Know you're a it's just you can't be at a loss for words the New Yorker festival okay [noise]\nSickening I mean he's taking a tragedy where children were killed and he is using that tragedy\nTo attack\nAn investigation of his own campaign\nWhat what effect do you think this the kind of criticism of the OJ the criticism and the FBI has\nDay to day well let me see what effect I don't think it has for okay I don't think it impacts the steps and the decisions that are being made bottom line prosecutors on the line agents their\nBooks having confidence in the OJ and and the FBI that has real life consequences agents come knocking on doors to try to find witnesses or others to provide information and cases when\nYou were selling that kind of distrust that has a real impact on public safety when juries are sitting in trials\nAnd are hearing testimony from FBI agents\nAnd they're thinking about what their president is set about\nHow you know they're liars and all you know part of the deep state trying to undermine this administration that can't help but have an impact there and I think that you know the public's confidence in our criminal justice system is essential for that system to be able to work\nAnd that to me as one of the ... the great\nTragedies of all of this is how that's being abused\nOne of the things I really worry about is where our way when this administration is over I mean what's the new normal at that point what have we sewed to based not just public discourse but\nThe the dignity of the presidency and Congress and the department of justice and others that we look and are entirely different than we were before\nHow's that for oh God oh my God [laughter] cut to present myself [laughter]\nUm you you are now a partner at ... big firm and a lot of 'em want you to run for office is that going to happen\n\nI Do I get that reactor [laughter] I pander with the best for them yet so I'm\nYou know when when people have mentioned that on I'm incredible flat or don't even feel like the right word there I mean it\nIt means a lot to me that people have said that they would like me to do that or would trust me to do that I'm a public service absolutely I mean that's in my heart and I believe in that\nRunning for office just feels very different to me than that I just have a hard time seeing\nRight but if but if a different president wanted to call you back to Washington wouldn't be out of the question for you to go\nOut I Believe in public service there we go [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nValley former deputy attorney general\nEvery so brief the actually
