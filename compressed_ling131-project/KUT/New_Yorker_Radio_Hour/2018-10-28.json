never shied away from talking about sexuality um I think that I Am a private person and I do not and I still to this day don't like talking about more personal relationships when\nI think this was

focus on now and right now I'm working with an organization\nWhen we all vote to help get awareness out after studying the twenty twelve election in this past twenty sixteen election there was a seven

recent album you're listening to the New Yorker radio hour with more to ...\n\n... the\n\nFox yeah which is a state invasive weed\nMost noxious invasive because they don't want you to have\nSo when you're looking now at at the politics that allow for this to happen right what do you think needs to change for something like this to stop being able to happen at\nI don't know if you're going to talk because it's too much money involved a little big big news and the little guy don't matter uh we get more people are gambling involved maybe we'll do some good but your Twenty one person for\nHow many hundred teachers don't care\nSo Emily ... is running for state representative and district thirty which has been held by Republicans for decades and it's nearly impossible race for her to when she manages a farming cooperative she served in the Peace Corps in West Africa and lived in guinea\nWhat she saw extractive industry in Africa made are fearful of what oil and gas companies would do is they rushed into Pennsylvania\nAnd do you usually get as involved as you're getting like what are you doing to support\nHer a button outside talking to people written stories and killing people trying to\nTry and do what can you know it's hard to do out here in the middle of nowhere that fond of the voting later writer\nAnd I signed up on my property that drives up on the neighbors that when I go to vote maybe we'll see it I don't know\nSo you've taken on the site probably the most active political you've ever been\nRight yeah do you have hope that it it will change though that you're doing it anyway and doing it I like to see I'm Lee at least I could talk to her [noise]\n\nSeventy miles farther on an hour and a half drive to the west from blooms gun shop we arrived in Huntington [noise]\nHuntington is a rural community midway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh it's words are lined with white pine and shaggy bark category\nWe came to visit Ellen Geller hard sixty three year old retired special ed school teacher she was so upset about the pipeline on our property that she'd actually gone to jail over she stood in front of some heavy machinery to block the equipment from digging on our land\nAnd she'd also Puerto noxious cocktail Iran to melt and Tabasco sauce as well as laid rotten cat food near where the pipeline workers\nWere working in order to make their jobs uncomfortable\nShe'd actually gone to jail over that\nBut she'd recently been released and showed us the ongoing construction some safe to settle\nThis this is or what this is still part of our wetland area tickets\nThe body and it gets rocky okay we're we're so\nFamous last words right\nConstruction he'd been so controversial in contentious at the gas hearts that pipeline workers carry cameras and they photographed us as we stood by the west side [noise]\nGuy has a camera in his hand has a video\n... she has like Alan and our daughter only had an organized what they called camp white pine on the far as part of their property to try to block the pipeline\nThrough social media they'd called and other protesters who came with the expertise to set up this sophisticated network of police and sip wires that allowed protesters to harness and clip into the trees to block chain sauce from clearing the lead at one point they had six activists sitting in their trees\nI spoke with a lease the daughter at their kitchen table\nAt least do you think with the election of Trump this makes any difference in this issue\nI think people\nFind it easy to blame these things on Trump\nBut Obama was already doing it anyway and in Pennsylvania we have\nA democratic governor who is watching all this stuff go down and he [noise]\nHe watched what happened to us\nAnd to everybody else along this line and all the bills and all the contamination of wells and the destruction of the forest and\nNow retired teachers being thrown in jail and he still\nTalks about how this project is necessary and and good\nYou know so that's what you get what the Democrats\nYou know people around here just don't\nFor the most part\nDon't get involved with politics a lot of people don't vote\nBecause they don't see value in it because they haven't been valued by those\nHave been in the positions of power\nI mean folks down in southeast PA were able to like actually physically meet with the governor over this pipeline\nGuessing about about meeting with us you know like he's never going to come out here to meet with people that just never going to happen they don't care about us they don't even the U.S [noise]\nOoh\nThere's a huge Gulf between what people along this pipeline thinking possible how they think politics actually impact their lives and it has to do with economics for the ... hard living in isolated in rural Pennsylvania the idea that a blue wave could save them just doesn't it yeah that's politics for CNN\n[noise] not reality but for Daniel ... running for state assembly and the more prosperous suburbs politics is part of the solution is\nDanielle would like to see the pipelines stopped but even if Democrats took control of the legislature which is unlikely there's no guarantee that they would stop but it's even less likely that the pipeline will change the outcome of Pennsylvania's congressional races and make it a blue state again\nStill Danielle is playing a long game like Democrats all over the country she's trying to rebuild the party's presence on the ground in local offices and in people's backyards\nDon't do it like we talk all the time I talk all the time about how through my own race I'm actually going to find people for next year ... elections because the more people than more people to talk to Democrats them where they vote for Democrats\nSo it's a I think it's a it's like a flatter like you're building a ladder and [noise] you're missing the wrong or the runs on the other side and you can't step up it's\n\nLots of Griswold reported from Pennsylvania and you can find everything she's written for a New Yorker dot com [noise]\nTell our coverage of the midterm elections continues next week with Dan ... who's been reporting

started the drama of course in the musical how succeed in business without really try\nAnd no I didn't forget it he was an all three hundred Harry Potter movies\nRight now Daniel Ratcliffe is in a new play called the lifespan of a fact\nAnd this may be the only working theater ever written to give a leading role to a fact checker and injustice I may say that we're all glad to see rectified\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Ratcliffe wanted to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand that here's Peter can be who runs the fact checking department\nSo there are no red cliff showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about food or for the New York [noise]\nHi [noise]\n[laughter] and he didn't look like under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where reporters a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the writer\nBecause of because one of one of the [noise] the the sort of the laws and I'm a business or something like ... and if I see a snow but if you to differentiate between ... one of the cardinals have things in my current job\nAs a sort of gifts equal weight to everything\nI mean the thing is people don't really

into the workplace you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct the construction argument I'm\nNot really a science more of them are just kind of it and other things you make there are kind of process will judgments that you make of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it 'cause I mean
