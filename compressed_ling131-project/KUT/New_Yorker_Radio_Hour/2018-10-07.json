that the police union sent along the bland one paragraph statement saying they look forward to working with crashing or\nA guy who works for a big clothing store here doing security really wanted to talk but his stores corporate office wouldn't let him he told me shoplifting is a constant problem he still kept his people stealing but now\nAfter the police come and arrest them the da says just to let them go with a ticket when somebody does end up in a city ... prosecutors sometimes withdraw their case anyway the guy said one habitual shoplifting came back to his store and stole against so fast\nThat he still had the cheese sandwich from jail and his backpack\n\nThis summer I ask ... office for some data I wanted to know eight months into his term what were they actually doing with\nThe police still arresting people for prostitution and shoplifting and what's his office turning all those cases away his crashed guy handed me some statistics about five minutes before I sat down with crafts for an interview\nSo I've just got this um and I have other questions for you but I'm curious you know what to do\nWith this the first time your office has kind of diet tally of the cases you're accepting and declining in this way\nThis is these are first metrics or I have seen or we have general sense of what we were doing because we passed certain policies that cannot help but push us in this direction but these metrics or the first that I've seen and so for example they reflect the fact that we're no longer charging\nSuch workers with crimes because\nSuddenly ... review them for the most part is\nVictims are we\nOn the piece of paper I could see that overall ... office had declined to prosecute about seven percent of the cases the police brought them that means that the police had arrested someone in each of those cases and each time the da's office had said no let him go or not charging them\nUnder the previous da ... however it around two or three percent\nTwo and a half percent declaration rate is a rubber stamp that means what ever go but we want is what I Will do\nCrafts there's office is on track to charge about two thousand fewer we'd possession prostitution and shoplifting cases this year that compared to what the da's office did and twenty Seventeen two thousand fewer cases [noise]\nSo what about all those people\nThe people ... trying to help by not putting them in jail\nThan I Love you come here\nWe're talking about what it's like in jail\nHi this is Amanda I met her in Kensington a neighborhood in North Philly people are selling buying injecting drugs out in the open I'm just going to use first names for the women I talked to there since they all had outstanding fines and warrants\nAmanda says she's been arrested twelve times for prostitution and told me the cops have sometimes been rough with her arresting are so many times also just seemed like a waste of resources I'm a I think um the whole prostitution thing I think it's a great idea\nWith them not charging anybody with anything\nThis is what I had expected here then I ducked into the backyard of a recovery house a place for women trying to stop using drugs to sit down with another woman\nNamed Shannon tell I asked ... what did she thinks of crashing herds decision to stop charging most prostitution cases um yeah I don't think that's a good idea [laughter] she didn't tell stopped using heroin and moved into this recovery house a few weeks ago\nBut she's been caught up in shoplifting and doing sex work to pay for drugs for years she kept saying that Phillies opioid problem is out of control especially in this neighborhood\nAnd it's it's a big problem inauguration and people don't want to touch it and get involved but if we avoid it\nIt's just going to go away it's not just going or\nIs it does not charging shoplifting and restitution seem like avoiding the problem do\nYes absolutely yes absolutely absolutely they're condoning my\nBad behavior can tell is very clear she is not saying jail is the answer but the idea of getting ignored by law enforcement as flawed as the system is that feels to tell like people in power are saying we don't care what happens to you\nAnd saying well we just can't keep sending you to jail so here you go just to believe\nIn in like death you know it's cool just living in now everything will be fine\nI told ... office which entail said press\nPerson sent me a statement saying they do want people like her to have a way out they see sex workers as victims who need help and the da's office can\nHelp them if somebody's been convicted a few times before for prostitution crashed our policy is to charge them and then instead of sending them to jail put them in a diversion program where they get connected to rehab and counseling\nBut Crowder office also said charging is really not the best way to help people like shouldn't tell because that can leave them stuck with a criminal record bottom line it should be easier to get help without ever getting arrested or charged at all [laughter]\n[laughter]\nCrass are maintains that the other crimes have declining to charge specially marijuana possession just fall into the category of dumb\nBy climbing the prosecution the dome we can put more and better police resources and prosecution of resources into the prosecution of serious crimes of

Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women have been treated for so long the way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nThe fact that she saw in sort of what was a split second something that I wouldn't have been able to describe as soon as she said it was like I Am furious of course of course I'm Crying because I'm curious I think that's such a common experience for women\nWhich is to express what outwardly seem set the sadness for the rich\nYes um it's hammered home to us so often that rage rage is fundamentally and express will because if we express it we will not be heard we will not be taken seriously will be seen as\nYou know crazy unhinged ball busting unattractive invalid marginal like it will go badly for us if we express our anger directly and I think that way I write about this in the book that one of the tactics that so many of us turned you we cry which is a fundamentally\nMore acceptable um mode of emotion for women it's it is in part because of what that manager said to me it will be understood as vulnerability\nWhich is more acceptable in women me right\nUm now that's especially true for white women by the way there is an ... there's a racial dynamic in terms of crying as being something that can elicit sympathy and uh that sympathy is very much more likely to accrue to a crying woman if she is white [noise]\nUm what are you saying what does what does a woman of color are more likely to do well women of color have written about this very beautifully that the vision of the traditionally vulnerable femininity\nI'm at the governor's sympathy your empathy is very often the suffering white woman the crying black woman is doesn't have that same kind of imaginative hold and more than that white women's\nTears have often been used [laughter] to cover for\nInstances of racism um so I mean it's the the vision of the suffering white women and the need to protect\nHer has often been the cover for lynching for\nUm you know for for racialized racist violence so I just want to you know when we talk about the tears of women being something that makes them vulnerable that is a dynamic that applies especially if you are a white woman\nI really do hope men read this book in in great numbers as well as women and for me it was a man especially affecting moment that I'm going to touch on your husband comes to you it's just as the me too movement is really exploding and he says I'm shocked the profusion\nOf it the violence of the horror of so many stories that we've heard about in the last year about sexual harassment and sexual assault it was all shocking\nTo him shocking to me and he's coming to you in some way for what you call feminist absolution so what's to be learned to your what can you tell him and really by extension what can you tell me\nWell I think that this I my hope is that this is\nA moment of education and readjustment of the view of of ... a full human experience for a lot of men who have just not seeing the have not realize how common how ubiquitous how every day these kinds of ...\nThis is part of opening the men are learning something about the experience\nOf not being men in the world in\nWhich much of the learning comes out in terms of defensiveness where\nFor some for some and it's a process and I don't I don't I don't worry about\nYou know thinking about oh my God in high school maybe I said something terrible I made a bad joke in the office that's what you\nAll for all of my anger and it's and and this is an angry book that I've written than I Am very angry at men and I talk about the complexities of\nUm the tricks of a women's movement or a feminist movement is it asks you to identify as your oppressor a group of people who are your intimate your loved ones you're the menu share beds within families with and who are your brothers in your father's in your sons and your friends it asks of us to\nComplicate those incredibly intimate relationships that are often loving and that are often based in need independents on who the man on whom we rely I really do feel for the men for whom this is difficult we are changing rules\nPartway through the game that's what this process is asking us to do that is hard\nBut there's no other way to do it we don't get to just start fresh with a generation starting now right if you actually want to change the way that the power structures work and the abuses that they permit and you want to say actually we don't want to have those abuses anymore we want to make them them\nNo longer acceptable that is going to mean that there are some people who are caught in the middle who entered the world with one set of expectations\nAnd one set of assumptions about how they could behave and are being told halfway through that that's no longer acceptable and\nThat is really that has a cost has a toll and I do feel for those guys that doesn't mean that I don't think the process is necessary and I stand behind it and I don't think I'm Alone in this most of the people that I Know who are fervent proponents of the me too movement and of this difficult painful process\nAre incredibly conflicted about it too we don't want to be the police to determine if somebody should lose their job or not lose their job and\nA lot of the anti me to stop said oh it lacks nuance and it's just a bunch of execution or no everybody I Know who is behind this movement you know most um intensely and fervently feels incredible conflict and so I feel tremendous sympathy for the guys to\nThe book and it's a remarkable one is good in math Rebecca Traister thanks so much thanks so much for having me David
