turned out not to be\nI was really struck by um you write about multiple contacts that you had with wounded and dying at the ... um\nEven in cases where you had to take a life you couldn't entirely separate yourself from their humanity and I wonder if\nAt the time that was something that you struggled with\nWhat you wouldn't be separating himself just from their humanity separating himself from your own humanity I mean I think that's really the issue um war requires you as I write in the book I quote Hemingway\nAnd his his admonition you have to suspend the or an imagination because the imagination\nConceal the worst consequences coming at you as you're going to be a good soldier you can't you you can't do that or at least much and so I I I'm\nHonored that but on the other hand never wanted to lose my sense of humanity and I think\nWhen you when you when you see someone else die and it it it ought to have an impact on you I mean it doesn't mean you don't process it and you can't understand why you're doing what you're doing but um [noise] I I think that uh\nYou know it was a spending so much that that becomes a good thing and you enjoy it becomes problematic did you see that yes sure\nAnd you hear about it you hear people who've written about it I mean there are plenty of people do wrote about the degree to which they you know I mean last themselves I mean you you you you can\nSee depictions of it in ... number of the movies of that period of time apocalypse now platoon you know full metal jacket these kinds of things you'll you'll get a sense of that\nYou came back highly decorated and highly disillusioned and I want to listen to that if your testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Nineteen Seventy one\nEach day to facilitate the process by which the United states washes her hands of Vietnam someone has to give up his life so that the United states doesn't have to admit something that the entire world already knows\nSo that we can't say that we've made a mistake [noise]\nSomeone has to die and so that President Nixon wealthy and these are his words the first president to lose a war [noise]\nWe are asking Americans to think about that [noise]\nBecause how do you ask a man to be the last man to die and yet now\nHow do you ask a man to be the last man to die from the state\nYou were twenty seven years old how did your decision to speak out about your sense of the ways that the country had gone wrong with the war in Vietnam aligned with your understanding of patriotism\nWell I Believe that was that because I think it's it's as we said many times at that period of time when people would attack us for a allegedly a not chewing to the party line or the national line and and\nSupporting our country no matter what in fact we had people showed us I remember some of those people would say you know my country right or wrong and winter yeah west right keep it right and what is wrong and make it right I mean or some of 'em and say well you guys do to support the troops and I hear some that back in may shout lady we are the troops\nI mean we told the truth and sometimes when you tell the truth and\nAhead of it a little bit of a lot of flak\nI'm sure way um I think history has pointed out we've seen Robert ... book\nA in which he acknowledges that he knew it wasn't going to turn out the way they wanted and yet they persisted and they never stead stopping and held themselves accountable\nRead Neal Shannon's bright shining lie one of the most brilliant books written about that war and and you see how early much of the deception and the lying in the self delusion and so forth took place\nSo um there were many people I wasn't alone in this effort there were lots of people here in the country or against the war and there were lots of vets who came back or against the war\nAnd lots of vets who are over there and one of my very closest friends done drugs or was not for the war at the time and he was killed three or four weeks after I left um there are other people who\nCame back feeling that it just was a mistake it was a it was being badly run and wasn't there was strategically lacking and uh\nAnd the fundamental threshold decisions that you need to make voids war not been properly made I eat what are we doing there what's ... what are we able to do what's the strategy\nAnd I'm In fact we entered into a civil war and we've got right in the middle of a civil war we made it a proxy war again proxy war with China and Russia being involved\nIn the background and the whole notion that you gotta stop communism and there because if you don't stop it there the domino theory nations are going to fall one after the other one of the fallacy of that has now been proven many times over but we stood up for what we believed was the\nArticulation of the truth in the best interests of our country\nAnd patriotism is standing up for your country now that can take different shapes informs sizes certain times and um it was very hard for some people that found them I think now people understand that we actually save lives that we\nCreated a political dynamic where it became a voting issue and the war and therefore politicians began to respond and indeed Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and others moved to end it uh as as soon as they deemed it\nPracticable um but I think that was I think the people who oppose the war we're\nJust as patriotic as people who supported it and that's a terrible thing about a war that is in such a conflict with the the thinking of the people that is why you need to have the American people fully understand and fully support fully buy in to what you're trying to do if you're going to send young Americans into harm's way\n[noise] you get him here I'm a deep conversation that you had with John McCain late Senator John McCain on exactly this issue um can you tell us a little bit about\nThat sure well John McCain and I came from very different places initially when we went to the Senate he from a prisoner of war five and a half years with on a ...\nYou know torture and and uh you know\nAbuse during the course of those years and I was of course in a different more from him he was in the air war I was down in the ... delta and I'm interacting with people and seeing first and sort of how to land war was going and so we um [noise]\nWere senators I came to the Senate couple of years before him but we were together in an airplane flying to Kuwait after Desert Storm and John and I were sitting opposite each other and neither of us had fallen asleep late into the night\nWe started talking and we just talked and talked and uh I ask John many things about an apple is about the\nAbout his father or his grandfather the tradition of their family how he got through the Hanoi Hilton what what it was like\nA flying I mean we talked about a lot and he asked me a lot of questions about the war I'd seen and being against the war and so forth and what we've resolved that night and I write in the book I write about the conversation and the experience of standing and John McCain cell with him in Hanoi\nWhich is remarkable but John and I resolved that our country which we both love\nAnd both signed up for the same reasons we felt a sense of duty in responsibility we felt that our country was still being torn apart by Vietnam there were still residual\nIll feelings within families and from one veteran do another uh people who are for people who are against it and we thought we needed to try to heal that word\nAnd one of the ways we thought we could do it was by a resolving the question of POW MIA were there are people still alive and ... and that was the precursor to being able to change the relationship with yet I'm itself and move beyond the war began to treat them like a country not a war\nWorked together for ten years a very closely he was on the POW MIA committee I chaired the committee we worked we made visits to Vietnam we\nBuilt to a record of gathering intelligence and information to address the questions that families legitimately hat\nAnd today because of that effort\nWe have more than seven hundred families have received remains and have closure with respect to their loved ones\nWe've been able to have the greatest single accountability system of any nation that ever went to war\nMy guest is former secretary of State John Kerry his new memoir everyday is extra we'll be back in ... [noise]\nTo\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nUh making sure that the values of of of a freedom are are being upheld and and yet now we have president who's\nA you know won't criticize Russia stands beside putting doesn't even hold and publicly accountable for interfering in our election and and you see president Xi in China moving into the vacuum we've left because we pulled out of the Pacific in terms of\nA trade and other things we're doing so I I think we're paying a very high price on their national basis and and you saw it just the other day in the United nations where the world laughed at the ... states\nWhat do you imagine that response was when the president was packed behind closed doors\nThe his response\nI Can't begin to imagine that I don't think anybody predict something like that with with this president I I'm not even sure that he understood that there were laughing at him\nWere still does\nHe was upset that you had some meetings with the Iranian foreign minister after you left the state department I'm a secretary Pompeo has said this is unprecedented is that true\nNo no it is not impressive what's unprecedented is turning the podium of the state department into a political podium and that's what happened and it is unprecedented uh to to to\nThat a former secretary of state of the United states and five term senator and former chairman of the Foreign Relations\nThat is going to meet with people that foreign conferences Henry Kissinger for forty years as a you know a consistently traveled to China Europe to Russia met with the leaders of this country has had conversations now let's be crystal clear\nAh I only met with the foreign minister in the context of international events I met at the Munich security conference where lots of people met with him I met at the\nOslo forum which was a peace conference in a conference about peace in Norway where lots of people met and I also met at the United Nations General assembly week in New York when he addressed the council on Foreign Relations and met with senators and lots of other people\nSince the ... and that was before the administration decided to pull out of the deal\nSince the administration has pulled out of the deal I haven't had one conversation\nWith any Iranian about the Iran nuclear agreement and I won't but but people need to understand what the president is done by pulling out of that agreement is actually make the world more dangerous he he\nHas he has a\nEmpower the I. R. G. see that the Republican Guard in Iran hardliners had been empowered because he pulled the rug out from under President Rouhani who took the chance of negotiating with the United states when others in Iran were warning him don't do this you can't trust the United states and and so\nA Donald Trump has now made that clear and ... and ... and there's no greater tribute I mean I'm not sitting around a I'm Upset for our country but I'm not upset personally about it um I I Do think however\nThat the fact that China Russia Germany France and Britain end around are all working to keep the agreement\nAnd they just had a meeting in two days ago in New York while President Trump's in New York they met at the un in order to discuss how they're going to keep the agreement together so what do they know that Donald Trump doesn't know\nI mean all of these leaders are committed to this day\nAnd and even if you let me make clear\nIn the Obama administration President Obama myself others none of us were lacking in concern for what Iran does in the region we kept the sanctions in place on Iran on their missiles on their\nOn their human rights abuses on their transfer weapons to Yemen we kept sanctions and we even raised though sanctions while we were negotiating the Iran deal so I don't take a second seat that Donald Trump or anybody about the mischief that Iran can create in the region the question is how do you best deal with it\nAnd if you're going to deal with it and this is what I said by the way I had a long conversation was secretary palm pale before they made the decision in\nWhich I told him what I learned from the Iranians what I thought would work in order to do to be successful in the policy and that was tell the Iranians OK guys we don't like these five or six things you're doing in the region you got to change them\nAnd we're going to stay in this agreement for the next two years because it keeps you from having a nuclear weapon but we're we're giving you that amount of time to work with us to try to change his other things\nThat way you would have brought China Russia Germany France and Britain with you and they would be supportive of what we're doing now rather than being completely disrespectful and frankly and questioning of the\nUm of the approach of the administration the administration is fundamentally trying to crush the regime there trying to have regime change by closing off their economies so there'll be a quote revolution but they really don't understand the Iranian mentality\nFrom the ... from the shootings that just took place the other day in Iran there's a big a couple of articles in various international newspapers about how that has strengthened the regime\nAnd strengthened Iranian nationalism against external efforts to try to\nThrow the government out so there are going at at the wrong way and and these are a proud people five thousand years of history I disagree with their engagements but the way to change them is to engage them not\nAttack them the way they've been attacked\nThey think I'm ... my guest this hour as former\nUs secretary of State John Kerry his new memoir is called every day is extract [noise]\nUm [laughter] so you orchestrated a back channel negotiations that even made it possible ... hold on the table to get the Iran nuclear deal done ... there are these arduous negotiations and all these different parties and you know one thing changes another thing has to happen over here\n[noise] how is it possible that all that was ultimately successful but you weren't able to sell this to the American people\nWhile the American people supported the American people support it and Congress gave me a little quiet President Trump will became a political football beg your pardon not people who supported President Trump well no because President Trump spent two\nYears with the presidential podium and the podium of a campaign for president hammering the deal is the worst deal in American history\nA but saying it especially Donald Trump saying it doesn't make it that not at all that's why I point to president Xi president ... ... you know president Macron prime minister may\nAnd Chancellor Merkel all think this is a very good deal most countries do most people involved in proliferation believe it's a good deal by the way\nThe security community in Israel believed it was a good deal\nThe generals in the Pentagon believed it was a good deal they didn't want to get out General Mattis the defense secretary didn't want it out Rex Tillerson from Texas when he was secretary didn't think we ought to get out so there are plenty of people who have a different position from President who's dead wrong on what\nWhen he was saying this agreement is the single strongest most transparent most accountable most far reaching nuclear agreement on the planet\nIran has to do more to comply than any other nation has had to do they literally destroyed\nCentrifuges that do enrichment they have to destroy their plutonium reactor could never be used again and we verified destruction\nThey have to have a limit on their stockpile of enriched material they have twenty five years of TV cameras tracking every ounce of uranium that his mind for the lifetime for as long as they're in the agreement\nWe have the right of challenge\nOf any facility in Iran that we think they might be making mischief and we get to go in and inspect and if they don't let us in within twenty eight days\nThen every sanction automatically comes back in place I mean this is an incredibly yeah we have a hundred and thirty additional inspectors in Iran looking at their facilities on a daily basis you pull out\nYou'll lose all that you lose any right to complain or control and anything and you get right back on the track that is leading you to conflict and yeah I heard it President Obama heard it King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia look\nMe in the eye and said you need to bomb Iran that's the only thing they'll understand President Mubarak of Egypt said you need to bomb Iran the prime minister of Israel came over to Washington and visited with the president wanted permission to go bomb Iran folks\nIf you want another war and you want to send young Americans to yet another Middle Eastern country or and fight yet another\nSort of tracking get on presidents on that track in a way\nBut if you want to be common sense approach to how you make the world safer and deal with nuclear proliferation as Ronald Reagan did with Gorbachev when he negotiated you negotiate an agreement like we did\nMy guest is former secretary of state and five term US Senator John Kerry his new memoir everyday is extremely backing Kim\nTo [noise]", "show_name": "Think",
