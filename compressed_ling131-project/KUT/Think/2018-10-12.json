[laughter]\nYou get off my lawn [laughter]\nAnd so there there there are several\nIssues here that are interesting to think about when we think about scooter hygiene are not just what you do with the scooter when you're done with it but first of all the attractiveness of just being able to pick up this thing this just happens\nTo be located at a place where you are and be able to hop on it and go somewhere in it and then just leave it when you're done with it now there is sort of a a carefree attractiveness to the whole idea of that right I don't have to take your responsibility I don't know if the put fuel in it or not to recharge it\nAs well I got a credit card and I see one of these things and it's not occupied I got me some wheels it's\nIt's everything your mother hated about the way that you grew up in fact what you should take the toy when you want to leave wherever you want that we use it because it's convenient right now doesn't build any Carrie [laughter]\nSo but what's interesting about it is how\nBecause things are so available and so easy\nPeople who might in other circumstances you liked that they're responsible people seem to shed all sense of responsibility\nWhen it comes to this thing I mean not only in terms of their personal safety you know the safety of other people when they were hurdling down the street at Fifteen miles an hour where there are pedestrians and cars and those kinds of things\nBut also what they decide to do with the scooter when they're done did they put it someplace that's out of the way of the district in traffic or\nDo they just cut up plop it down wherever they just mountain [laughter] and it remains there for other people to deal with but I think what's particularly interesting about this is how something that's suddenly introduced into an environment we have this other thing we're now our species\nHas now been confronted with this set of options that we didn't have before and how people different people respond to that because I'm sure\nOf course we don't notice them because they're not doing things that cholera tension to them there are many responsible scooter users who very carefully\nYou know ride their scooters and park there scooters and a very responsible place but the fact that there is the opportunity to do things that are not necessarily a a considerate of the people with whom you shared environment\nSo so I'm going to back up when you know several years ago they they expanded the number of available a Internet addresses and and that led to the dawn of of what has become known as the Internet of things and at the time people\nWere like well what in the world is the Internet of things going to allow us to do like the things need Internet and and initially people were like oh yeah yeah because now your thermostat could be connected the Internet oh yeah that makes sense\nNow we we we've reached the point where we can also just leave things in the world [laughter]\nAnd and they know where they are because\nBecause because of all these Internet connected devices and and so the scooters are eight or ... or a phenomenon related to bicycles and some other transportation devices in which companies basically are buying up a bunch of things like scooters dumping them them in in a city creating an app\nWhere you can use the device if you pay a small amount of money when you when you use it the beauty of this is you pick it up where you find it\nYou use it while you're using it you leave it when you're done with it and then somebody else comes along and they get to use it yeah and so we've gone from thermostats\nTwo major Republican I [laughter] in one fell swoop but his father was\nPointing out it creates this interesting opportunity to observe the development of social norm yes because\nWe we actually up until this point in the in in the United states at least\nPrivate ownership of of things was the norm so the norm was if you wanted a scooter to ride around you bought a scooter\nAnd it was yours and ownership means that you have control over who else gets to use it now [laughter]\nWe have this whole other a way\nOf thinking about things which is we have these objects that that they belong to somebody else they are available to use for a small fee\nBy anyone who comes along and wants to pay that small fee to use and what this does is to create a different set of social norms which is a beautiful concept in some ways\nBecause it presumably leads to less waste\nBut because it's so novel it creates this opportunity\nFor people to develop a set of norms about how to use them\nAnd and what we're seeing with this is that people are really suffering [laughter]\nMitchell develop a bit of a norm\nYeah what'd you said about new things in an environment introducing opportunities for\nBehavior that's not ... not learn ... and and Twitter is an example right I mean we've talked on preview shows about the idea that one created suddenly an opportunity for people to communicate with one another in vast numbers of people potentially\nWas out having any feedback about the reactions that they're getting from or the effects that they're causing all the people that they're broadcasting to\nNo one was used to that because there were very few people in public life who could communicate across vast swaths of other human beings\nAre so effortlessly and and so cheaply I mean for free right it was nothing to it so ... what would happen is we we were verdict to many of our baser instincts I mean but many people describe\nView of behavior in a civilized society is learning how to tamp down what we've also talked about our previous shows is our short term attention to what kinds of things were going to respond to respond to things is the very near future and long term consequences are not often on our minds\nUnless we learned that they should be on our modern\nNext week we'll talk about political

free and open to the public view this Tuesday at seven at the gas to find more detailed account to him [noise]\nWhat's interesting is we're sort of plan the direction of I'm becoming the sort of we're not actually supposed to become a human beings who are happy we're supposed to become human beings who look and seem happy on because our only experience of a happy human being um comes through\nOn Instagram or you know the image of Kim ... looking perfect\nUh before she goes to the gym or I'm an image on a on a giant you know\nA fifty foot tall screen of beyond say and Jay Z I just went to the onset costs are a few weeks ago I'm looking gorgeous and they're in love and you know in some ways it's art and it's we're so good at um were so good at selling the idea the image of happiness let's say\nBut we can't not only can't we feel anything more than envy when we see that image but we also don't actually know how it feels to be in a body that is in the image in order and you know we don't know how it feels to be ... and we don't know how it feels to be the on saying we what we assume is that\nThese people don't experience the same kind of\nSensations and longing Z and the self losing that we and ... just the ... of an animal that we feel ... um so when you spend all your time in these kind of like\nUm imagined that among these imagine images on and that's not to mention the kind of catastrophes and disasters that are fed to us on our phones\nIn words and images um when you spend all your time toddling between the sort of imaginary happiness that you can't feel that belongs to other people and is very ... feeling of dread and Jim that come that such in set into your phone every few seconds of the day\nUm that is I mean it's a recipe for disaster if their recipe for um severe dislocation from the south and\nSevere longing and and all of it is wrapped up again and this idea that\nI'm doing something wrong on the one who is failing which is you know part of our you know it's part of our culture it's part of our president's message us there are winners and losers um the winters are achieving greatness losers aren't and they obviously did something wrong if they're not great\nUm and and that's that's the kind of the moment that we're living in a and it's it's pretty it's pretty scary you know because it's not just an issue of\nA personal happiness is not just an issue of I'm trying to figure out how to feel good it's also an issue of not you know not wanting to let go\nOf a you know making sure that other people have the same opportunities to feel good that you that you have\nI think a lot about you know when when you write about our our sense that the only right way to view the world is kind of through these rose colored glasses we for example have the gall to tell people who are very ill that somehow a positive attitude might make them better and like the flip side of that is that\nIf we're not well if our lives aren't going well it's only ourselves that we have to blame\nYeah um it's it's interesting to think about um how much we're held accountable\nFor um things that are beyond our control yeah um the way that we tell stories about people who are sick um even in our own lives um we I mean a lot of people have a tendency to look for the cause immediately\nSo I mean okay so part of part of our culture that's kind of interesting to me is we are fed this illusion of control right I mean capitalism and the way that things are marketed to us at this exact moment in time\nWe're kind of given the impression that we can control the outcome of our lives right so there's always a pass to more happiness\nThere are a ... you know to smart perceive happiness or a path to an exit out a feeling bad I'm an exit out of feeling jittery or you know and and by bad basically you mean every that feeling anything right now because I'm to feel things is it in and of itself kind of a moral failure unless you're feeling elation which\nUm how many people feel that for how many minutes of the day it's pretty rarified thing to to strive for\n'em every other thing you can feel it sort of treated as something that's out of control it's not you know it's not a good feeling um and so you're supposed to fix these things on your basically we\nBecause every aspect of our lives is marketed a you know we're ... we're we're told there's a better way to do each thing um that we might be doing not quite in the right way um because we have this notion that we should be living our best lives\nWhich sounds too is just like optimizing every level of your existence I'm as a result of that to be also feel like we have control over things that are actually out of our control like sickness\nI'm a disastrous outcomes you know I'm impoverish meant um poverty um\nSo so Des ... so um so so as a as a result of that when we meet someone who's sick we we tend to say things like\nOh God did you ever smoke or you know a while or is this did they say it was the weight related um what did they think you ingested that made you you know sick or what what were you exposed to as a kid\nUm and you know this puts the it places the owners of responsibility on the individual like\nIf you were smarter you wouldn't have landed here um and it also treats the kind of the ... ... everything as having a church you know if you didn't find the cure you didn't\nBattle hard enough against the you know has menace and are you know I like I mean I you know it's the sort of sounds that we\nReceive kind of echo through my head but just to the statement you know I like people who don't get captured you know cut it up for me and I you know not to politicize all of it because there are many layers to and it's not all political\nUm but it's sort of like if you embrace this idea that I'm only week people are are capable of sort of being destroyed or or having misfortune um that puts a lot of pressure on the rest of us you know on everyone essentially\nI'm not to you know find themselves down the wrong path and it's it's sort of ... and not to even experienced the wrong thing kind of you know yeah\nI mean it is magical thinking to to to assume that we can make all the right choices right like if I buy twenty spin class of this month and a ten then then I Will never die we we all know that's not true but for ... for twenty spin classes I Can't believe it's true yeah\nAnd I mean it's nice to live in that fantasy it's it's tempting and almost ... you know and I'm I'm not at all I'm immune to any of the fantasies that are put in front of my face you know I'm not living in a in a year my own you know raising goats\nUm sometimes I Would like to be a fan of rats yeah it is it's like you know the fantasy of the year and the goats is like the ... the goats or a gorgeous adorable goats that have been you know filtered through the right filters on Instagram and they don't\nThey don't eat your you know your books or um you know\nAh do their business all over the place and leave filth in your face I mean you know there's not we don't really see 'em flaws and fills in our mediated experience and and part of\nThe challenge of just living a life is grappling with um the fact that you know feeling not so good and having a headache and having being sick at times and having windows that aren't cleaned every few minutes like at a at a luxury hotel you know these things\nStart to kind of press on your experience and make you feel like you're not only that your\nGod my I'm really not living my life um but also they make you feel like it's your you know you're you you're a failure like a you know I can actually walk by dirty window now in my house and say it should be that way I have dogs which took a completely retraining of my mind set\n'em but when I first had kids and I already had dogs before I had kids um I used to just sit in my house and think\nI I Am living the American dream I have everything I've ever wanted and everything looks wrong it doesn't look the way I wanted it to look it doesn't feel the way I Want it to feel\nUm I mean and it it didn't feel like anything because I was too focused on outlook does too focused on my own failures within that picture\nUm so yeah there it's it's kind of there there has to be a point and I and I you know because I'm an advice columnist I write a a vast probably calling for the cut which is owned by a New York magazine I see a lot of this and other people\nHeather ... is with us her new book of essays is called what if this were enough if you want to be part of our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to ... you can email think at K. E. R. A. dot org or find us on Twitter where at K. E. R. A. think [noise]\n... [noise]\n\nYeah I mean the interesting thing about someone like Marie condo and and I couldn't agree more that there's something very beautiful about the way she seems to approach things she's sometimes described as a minimalist but she actually kind of\nIn a way she sort of fetish sizes possessions the things that you choose to hang onto she wants you to treat them with great care and um you know sort of sort of make sure that their showcase you know\nYeah well and actually I kind of like that I mean you know it sounds I think it sounds a little bad on the surface um but it's actually I think the things that\nShe talks about loving are things that she has a real connection to 'em and it's true that if you I mean I keep everything um and I wouldn't say I'm a horror but I you know I really love old things\nAnd I think reading that book made me think a lot about um what which of my things actually work just clutter and which things ... evoke an emotional response I mean part of\nPart of what I feel like her book is trying to do in some ways and part of what um\nWhat I Want my book to do is to kind of emphasize the fact that it matters how you feel and I think that that's something that's a little bit rare um in our culture that message is um is rare and I think I think understanding the\nThe link between how you feel about the things in your life how connected you are some things in your life and also what your values are making that connection is so important because\nUm you know I I think that we've really lost sight it sounds a little traditional of me to say this but I Do think that we've all lost sight of our values I'm part of the ... I talked before about the process of blaming yourself\nPart of that pointing that blame inward is that eventually it also gets point outward pointed outward and I think some of the the sort of strife and contentious um talk that were that we bump into out there at this moment kind of comes from that that kind of pointing to blame in every direction and part of what\nPart of what I think is the remedy to that is sort of like having compassion for you know the sense the sense of failure that you have a lousy you and having compassion for yourself allows you to kind of spread that compassionate other people\nYou know so that's I mean I I think I realized in writing this that compassionate the value of mine and so how can I strength and that value and sometimes that does boil down to things you know things as small as like\nThis you know item to me links needed the love I feel for my daughter or links me to a compassion I feel for animals\nI'm so these little tiny artifacts of our culture and these little tiny ways of moving through the world are actually kind of crucially important to our the big picture of how we behave and treat other people you write really beautifully about um the thing you kept after your dad died was his old wallet\nYeah\nYeah his um he has he kept all of his um all of his old driver's licenses you know box um [noise] and then he also had his I think he kept his wallet on top of the box and it had on and it had it still has you know\nI still have the money that he had the cash you had in his wallet um when he died and the um the driver's license that he his last driver's license um [noise] but you know looking at those looking at those pictures you know that\nThat I mean and their driver's license picture so they're kind of interesting there's sort of an unplanned and\nThey're almost like the purest reflection of where the person will will really was that day and has nothing is more you know excruciating than going to the DMV to get your picture [laughter] annoying it'll be terrible and you'll look like a you know it'll look like a mug shot um\nBut but just looking at those pictures of him over the years you know it's such a condensed\nUm unguarded step shot 'em and it reminds me that um you know it feels like a precious linked to him but it also reminds me that um you know time passes quickly I mean ... ... one of the ironies of\nLearning to live in the present is also sort of learning to lead in reality and I think that letting in the reality that you don't have all the time in the world I'm kind of allows you to slow down time because you when you when you realize that you know\nYou will also be dead one day and you know time passes quickly and you're getting older um it really forces you to ground yourself in the moment and I think rounding yourself slows things down a little if that makes sense it's sort of like um\nYou feel when you really are in touch with reality instead of looking for an escape or distraction um everything kind of slows down and you think I have\nToday and I can make today go more I you know it's like my my goal is just to make everything go more slowly just really appreciate each day um because nothing is worse than the feeling that your life is just passing you by and I think that our current\nCurrent culture is very I'm very very very much a a culture of panic um and and and a culture in which you just feel like the years or or\nOr swimming by your face you know there's just too much frenetic distraction in our lives this is thank I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right let's\nGo to the phones now we have a listener on the line in Galveston Hi listen\nHow hard day very well thanks um\nSo I really I touched by this discussion I think it's a really important\nI'm being a young professional and I'm actually a physician that were just a constantly surrounded professionally with this ah ideal of perfectionism and it's hard not let that fill out a into your life [laughter] yeah\nAnd do a lot of my uh my female friends have had conversations about the\nAh with me over the years and walk [noise] one of the thing that um\n[noise] I really found to be helpful and life giving with ah actually I'm a research on them based in psychology um by professor at Chicago\nI'm Dr Sally swear canning and she studied young physicians and said how can we uh the young physicians and stressful situation alive\nI'm and knowing that either I think very much um but one of the things that she described that was really a beautiful uh seeing like less like a pie chart and more like a piece of music um with the idea that maybe right now I'm really focus on my career\nUm but in five years I'm going to go back in and spend more time I focus on the art that that brought me a lot of joy or maybe in this season you know most of my energy is going to be focused on my kid\nUm button the next the then I'm then I'm going to focus more on cooking and that to me just like give me a big deep breath of fresh air and says I don't have to do it All right now I have a long life ahead of me [laughter]\nI Love that illicit thank you for calling us or anything you want to respond to either\nI I Love that too it's so great and you know it made me think also that um well I mean first of all it's it's amazing to think about um\nYou know I I really write a a lot in my book about not trying to do everything um and it's amazing to think about how\nUm I think that a a big a big big change for me was looking at my life and saying which things do I actually not have to do huh um and one of those things was I'm not going to live in a hotel I have a friend whose house is it's a luxury hotel it's clean\nClean clean clean everything as spotless and it is she ... she knows that the value of hers and I salute that\nUm but she has a house cleaning that comes twice a week also [laughter]\nI salute that she can afford it [laughter] yeah I salute that too yeah or if if it's affordable here um but I think I realized at some point that I Can't I needed to trade one thing for another you know I Can't clean my house\nUm twice a week and it's okay um my house is going to have dog hair in it because I have two dogs um and that's\nYou know I'm tolerant of it um I clean it when I have guests over and I obviously I clean regularly also but I\nThink that\nThe piece of music thing um I Do think it's good to do what you really know is your top priority and that you love it's good to do it now I mean I you know there are things that\nI think I've put off for years and years and years and I think that um I you know part of that perfectionist urge um that she just mentioned um it extends to\nUm how we spend our time and sometimes it's good to just play the guitar for five minutes you know exercise for ten minutes we think we have to do it all the way but we don't you know we don't have to do that we don't have to be extreme of adult things we do\nMy guest is writer
