{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "I met that can that can write and this is the guy on your today chicken and the brain\nFascinating article came out about the attractiveness to human beings of fat\nAnd sugar in foods and I'll take both ... yeah exactly and so most of us do right but what's interesting we we know that over the past years right there's been this attempt to replace fast foods are having low fat no fat and of course the way they compensate for that they were placed the fat sugar\nAnd what this study by ... and his colleagues elegantly demonstrated that if you take actually they were using milk shakes in this particular experiment all the milk shakes were mash in terms of the total court content\nAnd yet they replaced the sugar with fat in different amounts and looks the way people responded to these ... in terms of their responses in their brain and incredible doping mean release when they were drinking sugared milkshakes right not so much with that well the fact just didn't matter some\nSugar drove the response which is fascinating it for a couple of reasons right the first of course is just if what you're trying to do is to get people to eat in a more healthy way you think well we've got to cut down on fat because\nThat is going to be associated with cholesterol and all sorts of other things and then what you do status to replace it with sugar which is something that's driving people to want to take in more calories than inadvertently you're putting people\nIn a in a psychological situation in which they're going to want to ingest more calories than they can turn it off and doing it in a way in this particular study that illustrates the fact that regardless of what we're consciously thinking about what we're consuming foods\nOur brains are responding in ways that we're not even imagining happening right I mean I I don't I don't think most of us would imagine that it other than the actual conscious responses we have to food if this is delicious or I Want more of that or I don't or whatever that in fact\nDifferent neurotransmitters are being released in response to different foods in ways that we're not entirely will not an all aware\nOf ... and what's fascinating as you know when the brain is responding\nWhat it's really trying to do the brain isn't really trying to give you a pleasurable response with the brain is trying to do is to figure out what it is it supposed to learn in that situation exactly and so when your brain releases all of this doping mean a lot of what it's doing is telling it remember this and do this again when the situation comes up\nAnd so when you get that huge response from that milk shake what it really does is to put you in a situation where\nYou start craving milkshakes when you see a milk shake you really want to drink it\nPart of what's happening is in this drive to make the food healthier they replaced the fat with sugar you put people in a situation in which the brain then learns eat more of that sugary stuff right\nAnd and that's why it backfires and then people don't know why they think I'm but I'm eating fat free food right and of course all of this\nHas an evolutionary history because of the scarcity\nOf good sources of sugar\nAnd for for a long period of time and and now of course the sugar is found in abundance I mean we can get sugar very easily in contemporary society at least in industrialized world and so now\nIt's understandable that those vestiges of our evolutionary past which taught us to go get more sugar because it's rare that you're going to encounter such an opportunity or now functioning to our detriment right\nAnd this is just an example of why it is that it can be very difficult to control our behavior in a modern environment\nThat is so radically different from the environment in which the brain developed in the first place\nAnd food is one of the places where you really see that because a food because of a modern agricultural practices food has become fairly cheap and fairly plentiful so that it it when we don't have the kinds of scarcity\nIn this culture you know it's not that there are places in the world where this happened for us but but in this culture we don't have that kind of scarcity and our brains then lead us to do things that seemed like a good idea like a hundred and fifty thousand years ago\nAnd uh aren't such a good idea anymore right let's talk a little bit of time on\nSweeteners or national sweeteners did they had any effect on the brain and the way that our brains\nWell received sugars that's one way to create a trick writing because what our\nBrains are doing is responding to our taste receptors to what it is that we're eating so if you create a taste that simulates a taste of a natural thing like sugar and you create aspartame or whatever other kinds of things people do that create that sense of sweetness I suppose the brain will respond\nIf it's wise to the taste receptors that of course it's not going to have the same effect perhaps on other systems in the body because the other systems recognize if this was in fact not sugar but does that actually\nDoes this actually causes a problem because part of what happens is again remember that what the brain is trying to to do is to predict the future and then react to the future so it's not just the case that this artificial sweetener gives me this sensation of a delicious sweet taste it actually is an alert to the body\nThat there's about to be a significant violation of homeostasis right as a big word what does this mean your body wants to stay within sort of a particular set of parameters\nAnd if I throw a bunch of sugar at it I actually run the risk of doing harm to my body that's why a diabetic it has to monitor or their blood sugar because because having too much sugar in the blood can actually be a problem\nSo if I get an alert from the from my brain telling me I'm about to get a big influx of sugar than the brain sends a message down to my pancreas and get busy and producing insulin and so you actually\nDrop your blood sugar in preparation for all the sugar that's about to come in through the stomach so you've got this red alert going are are you know\nAnd and and now you know the Packers were ... uh uh releases the insulin the your blood sugar level jobs and then and then your body so they're going what\nWhat am I [laughter]\nAll right so now your body is confused because it's got to drive your blood sugar backups and now it says you better each something because I've I've got a ... a drop in blood sugar so it's it's actually not such a good idea\nTo trick your brain next week we'll discuss I accept that data and the brain with ... and document it David ... Perlman and Michael ... our our engineers that can I can write in a pretty good as on your head at Katy mania paint costing tax and\n\nThen you had just one of the programs that it made possible because as\nOr contributions to K.

T. dot org and we are community support in public radio from UT Austin it's one minute\nOne o'clock\nSo not exactly a sweeping the approval for Congress in general\nYeah and I think it points to the challenge at some voters or see in in Congress and its relationship with the White House\nDemocrats this year say that they're more likely to closely follow election news then Republicans and I wonder if that's just typical for a party that currently doesn't control the White House or either side of the legislature\nOne thing we know that of course midterms are all about turnout about Suzie as him and Democrats say they're paying a bit more attention to elections and they also say they're more likely than Republicans to say that they're more enthusiastic about voting in the midterms this year than in years past\nOr in typically that's a pretty good indicator of uh what party may be poised to do well in twenty ten we found a large enthusiasm advantage for Republicans and of course I was a very strong Republican year this year we find that Democrats have a a a modest edge and enthusiasm\nAnd like I was really interested to read that abortion is less important to ... voters than most of the other issues besides a minority rights and environment this year is that unusual historically as abortion usually hire an Republicans priority that\nWell it's a it's an interesting observation that you make it doesn't rank very high among Republicans I think most of that has to do with how important the other issues are to Republican voters like the economy and terrorism and immigration\nNot so much that abortion is an important to Republican voters but that there are select or a handful of other voters that are even more important to Republican voters\nHow does voter outlook on last year as Trump's tax cuts track with family income\nWell in general or people with higher family incomes tend to be a bit more a supportive of the Trump tax cuts\nAre people with lower family incomes tend to be a bit less supportive and that relationship holds within party that a high income Republicans are are by far the most supportive of the tax cuts lower and middle income Republicans are supportive but a bit less so than those high income Republican\n[noise] there's a positive or negative view on economic issues shape voter behavior or is it part of the negotiation that shape how people feel about the economy in a in other words you know if if one party is running things does one tend to look at the economy a with a little bit more uh optimism\nThe shore so that it is yes in more so today than ever before in the Nineteen nineties and in decades past the economy wasn't necessarily viewed through a partisan lens\nBut today it is a we know a large majority of Republicans say the economy is an excellent or or good condition\nOr Democrats or twenty thirty or forty points less likely than Republicans to offer that rosy assessment so it's it's the partisanship that seems to come first of the economy is viewed through a partisan lens today and as I say that that's new it wasn't necessarily the case Twenty years ago\nOne really interesting shift recently has been the number of voters who say Supreme Court appointments are very important factor in their decision making this year\nRepublicans um at least according to conventional wisdom has have been prioritizing this for some time it has not been a major driver for Democrats in the past any sense of what makes this year different\nWell I think that the cabinet nomination an appointment certainly mobilized Parsons on both sides I think many Democrats were were were very uh motivated by that issue in the express up to us in our surveys\nOr our survey was conducted in late September so a few weeks have passed you do wonder if that uh the focus on the Supreme Court appointments may waned somewhat with Kevin a bit out of the news as compared with a few weeks ago\nBut it certainly has been one of the top issues at the fall for both Republican and democratic voters\nSome of these questions you have asked a multiple times over the months are you seeing a certain things move in a particular direction\nWe've seen enthusiasm and interest to pick up a little bit throughout the course of the year that's that's fairly typical but again to come back to this main point we're seeing really high engagement in this midterm election\nUh typically in mid term election voter turnout is is relatively low in fact twenty fourteen was one of the lower mid terms of of recent memory some singles point to this perhaps being a higher turnout mid term election as we've seen that enthusiasm engagement tick up\nIs that happening on the among the letters of both parties\nIt is what's really interesting here is unlike some past midterm years uh it's not that one party is low on enthusiasm and the other is high both parties are pretty high it's just the Democrats or even a touch higher than Republicans Republicans are motivated\nThey're engaged or enthusiastic and many are supportive of of Trump in say their vote is a vote for Trump\nIt's just that when compared with Democrats this year Democrats at the moment seem to have just a bit more enthusiasm\n[noise] um why has the divide over health care grown between Republicans and Democrats [noise] well\nIt's always been a a divisive issue for part of sins and I think as as the policy has evolved in in Obamacare has suffered some setbacks legislatively it's just further reinforce the partisan divide on this issue and you've seen Republicans\nA staunchly against the Republicans a staunchly for the law and that that divide has just grown somewhat in in recent years\nThere's certainly a lot of foreign policy news happening I Wonder how engaged voters are right now in foreign policy issues as compared with domestic issues that are in terms of um things that are motivating them to go\nYet domestic issues seem to take priority at the moment and that's not unusual but issues like health care the economy and immigration these are top tier front of mind issue for voters in though we are in an act of foreign policy environment those foreign policy issues I tend to be a second tier lower tier for voters\nWhite voters tell you about their views on how much the U.S should be willing to compromise in dealing with foreign allies\nWell it's really interesting because here again you see a partisan response that Democrats say that the United states should uh really consult its allies and see if they disagree strongly on any foreign policy decision\nAnd Republicans take the opposite view and say that the United states should follow its own national interest even if its allies strongly disagree so the public is divided bipartisanship on what the best approaches when dealing with international issues in dealing with its allies\nI was interested to read that just over half of Americans think the U. S. gets taken advantage of by other countries but that percentage is actually weighed down from the late nineties\nThat is in it which is an interesting finding and the reason is way down since the Nineteen nineties is is that Democrats have fundamentally changed their views Nineteen in the Nineteen nineties Democrats are a majority of Democrats thought that other countries off and took unfair advantage of the United states\nBut today that shares just twenty eight percent and that's the main driver of the top line the overall number is that Democrats no longer believe that other countries take unfair advantage of the U.S they said that they generally treat us has fairly about is fairly as we treat them\nSo Democrats will often say the Republicans have gone far to the right Republicans ... Democrats have gone far to the left is there evidence that\nVoters are in fact moving farther apart from each other toward more extreme positions on both sides\nWell there is evidence that Republicans and Democrats have been moving farther apart from one another and their basic values and beliefs and in some people talk about this and they called this political polarization is part of what we've studied in recent years is that it's true that more Democrats now hold consistently liberal views on issues and more Republicans now hold consistently conservative views on issues\nAnd as a result the gap the overlap between the two parties is less than it was in the past\nAh and that's a new and that's that's that's different from ten or twenty Twenty years ago but it's important to note that both parties have moved not just the Republican Party and not just the Democratic party\nA lot of people worry about this polarization is there a reason to believe that it's bad for democracy somehow or is this just an expression of how people feel\nYeah that's that's really one of the the hot topics in political science and other realms it's not a question that we have an opinion on but it is interesting to note that many years ago and political science people limited the fact that uh the public wasn't more consistent and their views are that why shouldn't more Democrats take liberal positions in Washington\nRepublicans take more conservative positions it would almost be a sign that they have a have a robust grasp of what their partisanship means now that we're in an environment where that's more and more the case there are many people saying hey wait a minute there are a lot of it perhaps negative consequences so it's it's a robust debate but it's\nFrom our point of view it's not normative we good or bad but there certainly is a lot of conversation out there about potential negative impacts\nDo you have a sense from either this research or other polls that you've done as to whether there are a lot of truth swing voters left out there\nIt is true that some relatively small share of all voters are are true independents they don't mean to either party or in they don't affiliate or lean\nRepublican or Democrat but that's relatively small group of voters so yes of course swing swing voter still exist but the vast majority of voters are either a self identified partisans or lean to a partisan group in and behave much like Parsons himself so it it's a really a two party answer of course yes there are swing voters but the vast majority\nOf all Elizabeth voters have some form of a partisan leaning or affiliation [noise]\nTyson is a senior researcher with the Pew Research center Alex thank you so much for making time for\nGlad to be here coming up how laws governing elections affect voter turnout and how who votes effect selection\nThis was the first presidential election and fifty years without the protection of the voting rights act um because the U.S Supreme Court had got at the voting rights act and the twenty Thirteen Shelby County beholder decision that's after a short break and\nAnd so it has a large number of people who are in public housing Seventy one percent of whom are African American and for many that's the only ID that they have Alabama said no public housing id does not count although that is clearly government issued photo ID\nSometimes Carol when we talk about the specter of voter fraud despite um all the studies that have shown that it is incredibly rare that it that it almost never happens and it certainly doesn't appear to to throw elections in this country at least there's no evidence of that\nIt's almost like removing somebody's appendix because we know that a tiny fraction of people somewhere will develop appendicitis over the course of a lifetime is the only explanation for this that people are trying to disenfranchise people of color is there another possible explanation\nI Can't find one I mean that's really ... I mean the because before the requirement for voter id there wasn't this rampant voter impersonation fraud\nSo that not having an ID did not lead to people trying to impersonate somebody\nAt the polls to tip when the election that didn't happen now we have had voter fraud in the past but that's the kind of fraud that is perpetrated by election officials are where their rigging absentee ballots or where they're stuffing the ballot box kind of deal\nBut we haven't had the kind of agree\nHe just rampant taking controlling an election peace happening even before we had id so this is a solution in search of a problem but the solution what that solution does for instance in the twenty sixteen election\nEight percent of whites said that they were prevented from voting because they didn't have the id twenty seven percent of African Americans said that they were stopped from voting because they didn't have the id\nAnd that of course of twenty seven percent of just Thirteen percent of the population that's a big effect on on the overall black ... it it is\nAnd so yeah that that figure is just from Wisconsin but you know when you began to look around you're seeing that kind of drop off and so one of the things is that department of motor vehicles are not always easily readily accessible\nIn Alabama for instance after they said no public housing id then governor Bentley shut down the department of motor vehicles in the black belt counties wow and it took a lot of pressure\nTo get them to open them but the way that they open them is that one county would have a DMV open for one day a month\nAnother would have one open for two days a month or so that's not readily accessible uh so it's this kind of of of documentation issue as well as distance issue\nThat leads to the disparate impact of this kind of voter id law\nSome jurisdictions around the country are a limiting the number of days of early voting the number of hours that people can vote why does that have a disproportionate effect on voters of color\nAnd so what that does is again because income and race are linked in the United states and so when we have voting that's on a Tuesday in November that's generally a work day\nSo just take it ... it is hard to get through the traffic here in Atlanta in order to get to work on time so you can punch that clock at eight o'clock\nWhen the polls open at seven so you can punch that clock at eight o'clock so that you're not losing pay or having to take some time off in order to vote\nAnd somewhat early voting does is it ... bans the voting period so that people do not have to choose between\nLosing pay or losing the opportunity to choose who's going to be making the policies that affect their lives so let's take a North Carolina for instance\nWith North Carolina did is that they asked immediately when the legislature will see that they asked for data by race on voting they saw the days that African Americans voted early disproportionately so\nAnd they cut those days how pay off the gas they also recognize that\nIf what you could do is to make the lines in tolerable not only would it demoralized people who are standing in line\nBut the research is clear is that that word about these long long long lines then spread throughout the community so what they did it Mecklenburg county where Charlotte is in Charlotte has Fifteen Percent of the state's black population\nThey cut the number of early voting sites from twenty two\nTo four twenty two to four ... think I'm ...\nSupport comes from darn authentic Moroccan Mediterranean cuisine specializing in ... and other delicacies in a Moroccan setting located at four hour wait west eleventh with plenty of available parking after six PM and B.
