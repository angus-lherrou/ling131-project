called the loose girl to go into the city and go to bars\nBut one night her friends insisted that Ellen come with them to a new spot on the Upper East side of Manhattan It's not like other bars they said she walks in and the place is packed young people are standing three for deep from the bar and then a big tall guy walks over to Alan and asked if she wants to go to a show\nSo I said why I said

happened to be the sexual revolution when he spotted a business opportunity\n... business plan was to meet a lot of women so business plan will tell you that the word single ball was ... lead to the ... that I was inventing anything like that whatsoever\nAllen bought a tired old bar with a bullet hole in the window and set about making a place where women would feel comfortable going alone where men could try a pickup lines for the first time he threw some thought us on the floor and hung some Tiffany lamps above the tables\nCollege kids were saying thank God it's friday so that's what he

when they met at Fridays\nThree months later we were engaged in nine months later married\nThough is the lesson here to insult someone on the\nPhone [laughter] he's never live that down but as I said

[noise] forty eight degrees in the capital city rain likely to continue throughout the evening and into Wednesdays and well one minute to pass one\nAnd how do we had a we negotiate those two extremes of how we cling on to life and so in that initial flight over you have everyone in this plane is fixated on eating\nBecause he's already people are saying this is the most wounded man and the history of war and we're managing to keep him alive and what does it mean if we can keep someone who's been as injured as she is alive what are the implications of that and there's this other soldier who has a relatively been all wound and seems okay but when nobody's watching you just ...\nYeah there's so much there's so much sadness wrapped up in the fact that everybody understands that they may be able to keep the eaten alive but they're never going to make him better right like he's not getting ... nobody expects them to resume and normal life\nNo and that's not the expectation and the book um you know it's a relatively short book a and it\nIn writing it it was always very clear to me\nThat the the central tension in this book is what unions wife Mary does\nAnd uh you know the narrator in the opening of the novel basically begins with stories and I want you understand Mary and what she did don't know if you will yeah um and I don't want to spoil the novel but that you know a her choice you know her church at the end I think is you know maybe a somewhat unexpected one\nAnd hopefully the reader can understand ... empathetic with her choice by the time you get to be in the book\nBut it's really about that central choice and in many respects to I mean the title of the novel is waiting for Eden but the the the ... the book is I have always felt it's about Mary his wife more than anyone else\n[noise] um I was trying to carefully right questions around this because it is so short and I don't want to spoil it for anyone um one thing that I don't think spoils things is that we know from the beginning because the narrator tells us Mary wants her husband to die now she can't leave him she's keeping a vigil by his bedside um [noise]\nThe narrator understands that Mary wants eaten to die but I I wasn't sure whether that was something she would actually have told similar or he's given some on missions to your narrator\n[noise]\nWell the narrator is omniscient and I'm One of the challenges I add early on in writing this book and the structure of this book was I knew from the outset I wanted to be a very intimate book\nAnd a typically when you're writing and you want that level of intimacy you rely on a first person voice\nBut the challenge was the key characters are Mary and eat him who is locked in his own body with varying degrees of consciousness and so the two of them are separate from one another so you can't if you're married for marriage point of view you can have access to eat and vice versa\nSo the level of our missions I Need it lends itself to a third person\nNarrator but then you don't have the intimacy and so that is where ... best friend comes into it the narrator who has that ... a because he is dead but has the intimacy a of of speaking and the first person\nOne thing the narrator tells us is that um he sort of mired eating at the great pleasure he took in food which is a very it's a fascinating detail to choose because it's the kind of delicate sensibility that maybe a lot of people don't associate with warrior\n\nAnd that was very much a my intention I'm was you know we have in this country uh you know a\nExisting and growing civil military divide and there's often a sanctions about you know what a marine would be or soldiers would be or people who go off to these wars and I very much in the character want it to show someone who um you know wasn't what you would expect\nAchieved use it as his active choice but he you know tell her that the war is taking something away from him and he doesn't actually feel like he has a choice anymore\nOr something he he needs to do um [noise] so that when you when you're in the sections of the book that that go back in time that is really the central tension between between you and Mary is whether or not he will or will knock on the employment that he's finally will and\nI'm\nMary has been paying attention to the people killed in the war to the count of of American dead in the war\nAnd I wasn't entirely clear if she had started that counts for her husband was ever wounded or if it's started after he was wounded and she was caring for and with him in the hospital\n[noise]\nYou know there's this idea of the counting throughout the book and um\n[noise] and it's really an idea of not only counting but wanting to be counted ... and Mary has this fear that she doesn't know how long it's going to be in the bed and she has this fear everything he's been through will somehow not be counted up\nNow that the the opening scenes we talked about the young soldier who is not wounded that badly but winds of die very quickly\nAnd how she would clearly be counted as the dead from the war and we'll be acknowledged and seen\nBut they eat in because his suffering goes on for so long\nMight not be counted so Mary is always in her mind is this idea of eating dies today he will be the you know whatever number person to have died in the war and she keeps holding on to that number because for her and not only is the number of the knowledge when everything she's going through everything her husband has gone through\nThis also the idea that there will be some type of closure that this will end and then we'll end with a number\n... [noise] um\nThe story race for me some interesting questions about about euthanasia frankly because we can think\nOf a lot of really dire ways that it can be abused it can go wrong it can be tantamount to murder we don't let ourselves think very far about the possibility that it can be an act of mercy at least that's that's my sense of the discourse that surrounds it\n[noise]\nAnd I think one of the things that um and I think this book is very much a book about euthanasia too which in turn makes it a book about life because I think we're we're really debating when we talk about euthanasia is what is it is not life\nIs someone who is in a hospital brain dead unaware of their condition but with a heartbeat is that person alive or not alive\nAnd therein lies the debate and so you know throughout the book\nI'm eating and Mary and the narrator are wrestling with these issues of what does it mean to be alive you know for instance so we were just discussing before or you alive if the only way you can live your life is by going in and out of wars\nUm are you is eaten alive later on in the book Mary and eat in the central tension in their marriage if they want to have a child and so what are the implications of that and that decision really echoes out um throughout the entire book so it's a it's\nIt's euthanasia is is a way in the novel to get at a law a lot of these much larger themes which is what does it mean to what does it mean to be a lot ... um that\nChild is is there she's president she's in that the hospital room at times um\nIt's it's also interesting the way you wrote her as a almost like a distant figure she's around but she ... ironically this this child that Mary wanted some much can't be the center of her attention because of the situation she's in caring for her husband\nAnd I think you learn the pact that's made between Mary and eat and that allows this child to be born and how because of the circumstances of the child birth\nA and I say I was not wind to spoil the part of the story but you learn why this child can't be central and you learn why Mary even as a new mother has to allow her her own mother the Charles grandmother to raise the girl for the first few years or she is keeping vigil\nUm would eat and and you know and the birth of this child you know also bumps up against these ideas of you know the the the real thin membrane that exists between life and death you know one marriage wounded oh sorry when eating his wounded\nA Mary is pregnant with their child and she goes to use bedside and has the child in the same hospital that eating has and\nUm so the little girl meets her father and the burn ward\nUm you know and those were themes I wanted to get a you know how you know we we walk around every day feeling as though our lives are impressionable um but you know the reality is anything but the reality is there is this ... between between life and death\n[noise] this is think I'm ...\nAnd I guess this hour is novelist Elliot Ackerman he wrote books including green on blue and dark at the crossing his new one is called waiting for eating if you'd like to join the conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to or you can email I think AT T E R a dot org\n[noise] um [noise] I I I\nWonder if the narrator I couldn't decide if the narrator is is punishing himself for\nThe love he felt for both eaten and marry like like maybe the narrator has a choice and and doesn't have to be in this place where he ... he appears to be stuck\n\nYou know I think the narrator me she stuck in this ... space but he doesn't seem as though he's trying to actively leave at the book\nIs not him trying to figure out how to free has so he's sort of trying to understand he's trying to tell the story\nMore than anything if a narrative has one very clear motivation in this book he says it at the in the opening sentence which is I Want you to understand Mary and what she did I don't know if you will um so she wants her to be understood um and I think\nThroughout the throughout the novel that's that's what he's trying to convey\nTo the reader um because her decision of her decision is is is messy and the events for how she or her her background and how she gets up to that decision\nUh is complicated so uh I don't think that he necessarily has a choice but the narrative truly has a motivation and he's been reduced down to the only thing he can do at this point which is try to\nTell you the reader their story and try to make you understand\nWhen you survey the landscape of section that has come out of a fiction by American writer since come out of Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts um\nDo you feel like you're deliberately trying to do something different I by drilling down to to the most intimate kind of personal stories you can possibly find or is it just the way you know how to tell a story and the way you choose to tell a story\n[noise]\nI mean it's a little it's a little bit of both you know I Would offer you know one of one of the nice things when you're a novelist and you have\nThis flourishing of fiction it's come out of these forces you know these writers are all my friends we all you know we all know one another I'm pretty well um so that's nice there's a you know there's a community there um but um\n[noise] you know I Would say the the thing that I feel I'm often striving for us to tell stories that come out of\nWater seemingly inaccessible places you know my first novel was the story of an American is killed by an Afghan but the whole book was told from the perspective of the Afghan and my second ... novel was a\nA story said on the Turkish Syrian border during the revolution and it's really sort of the story of the revolution but talk to the prism of a failed marriage\nAnd I'm often trying to get at what are these and accessible seemingly inaccessible places\nUm and to make them accessible and the only way I think you can make them accessible as by telling stories that are more universal\nThat we all understand you know we all understand what it feels like you know to be in a relationship you know whether that's a marriage or otherwise and to feel it's faltering and I would say that is\nIn many respects having spent a lot of time covering the Syrian civil war when you talked to activist they would say they were in love with the idea of the revolution and seeing it fail they walked away heartbroken ... so it's like a story of heartbreak and the same thing in Afghanistan so when I'm off and trying to get out of his just trying to distill the essential elements are very complex advanced into very human story is\nMy guest is writer Elliot Ackerman his newest novel is called waiting for Eden if you'd
