as long as five hours to the bottom most people are ready for a big meal in a long deep sleep if they can get it\nBut for an elite few this is just a warm up increasingly the canyon is becoming a destination for trail runners wanting to push the limits from kj ... reports on what it means to run from one room to the other\nAnd back again\nCool your heels at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and you'll see them tiny packs on their backs water bottles strapped to their chest focused looks on their face to face\nThe ram ta ram ta ram uniform Jocelyn brags ran down the south rent early this morning then ran across the canyon floor up the north random then backed down it's been tough road\nTough climb beat us up pretty bad\nWhen Griggs reaches the top of a Kenyan again in a few hours she'll tackled almost two marathons worth of deep rugged trail and why\n[laughter] that's a good question [laughter] friend of mine wanted to do it and I said that I Would do it with her\nSince it doesn't require a permit there's no official data on how many people take this challenge\nWhich ranges between forty two and forty eight miles depending on which trails you choose but what's clear is that its popularity has exploded in the past five or so years with countless articles and Facebook groups highlighting its beauty\nAnd pain and twenty fourteen it hooked now same trail runner cat Bradley\nIt's so humbling you know the canyon never ends and so you know you have no choice but to feel small on\nThe roof was twenty five miles longer than Bradley had ever run but still she beat her ... up the trail\nI just have to totally new understanding what my body was capable of\nThat jump started Bradley's trail running hunger in twenty Seventeen she won the western states one hundred mile endurance run a few months later on her eights room to room to room run she smashed the women's record but more than twenty minutes\nThat Bradley says her favorite canyon memory was actually a few years before when your headline and point out somewhere between the two rounds and she had to navigate the empty trail by the full moon\nI just felt so connected and to where it was and I felt so lucky to be experiencing a moment you know completely alone and it's like a bad place\nThat sweet solitude draws athletes from all over the world and some of them and evidently wear headphones talk loudly and the wee morning hours and aren't courteous to hikers and mules\nCanyon rangers say that since the running boom began bathrooms have gotten more crowded and more litter has appeared along the trail\nRescues of increased to with one major saying these runners sometimes don't understand the vital importance of eating salty snacks\nTo replace all of that sodium there sweating out\nFor many who love this place\nMaking room for the runners is a big shift\nNever ran through a museum\nSo [laughter] I've never come and say oh I got to the Smithsonian in two hours Brian couches tending the phantom ranch canteen at the bottom of the canyon\nHe's hikes the back country here for decades\nExperienced felt\nThis do rented a room one day\nI I don't think you get the experience [noise]\nAt a spigot just outside\nRunners have been filling up their bottles all day one of them is Toby s lawyer who hit the trail at four AM and says he's watched all kinds of people challenging themselves today fellow runners and hikers ranging from very young too very old\nAnd I can see people doing things that twenty forty fifty years ago it wouldn't it just wouldn't have happened\nAnd that's ... thinks that desire to push past old boundaries creates such a sense of possibility\nWhen I go back into the real world and I get despondent hopeless I think about people who are out here doing this stuff and I think the world does change it takes time but it happens and that that's his firing\n... still a few hours of intense climbing from the real world now with beer pizza and family waiting at the top for here and now I'm seeing a Sikh reporting from the Grand Canyon\nI'll tell you what walking that trail is enough for me [laughter]\nPretty up there now from Indonesia where we're closely following the recovery efforts after friday's earthquake and tsunami\nThe island of ... was the hardest hit and according to the government the death toll has risen to more than fourteen hundred which of the attention has been focused on the city of Paul Lulu where most of the confirmed dead have been counted but the United nations is warning that humanitarian teams\nWe'll have at least some of the worst affected areas on the island and it's much more difficult to get food and medicine their new while there's also been a volcano eruption on the same island hundreds of miles away from polio

Bush you or talk about later on in but\nLet's go back to Laura Miller as you mentioned um we'd go on to be the mayor of Dallas um when you were in high school um your issues kind of muckraking journalist when your father spent time with her and you too had sort of parallel experiences with her\n[noise]\nI wouldn't say parallel she was focused on him and kind of ignoring me mommy and rightfully so she was the mayor by the time I met her I don't know why\nI'm you know she had to put up with me shadowing her for a day this was one of the many programs to Dallas has a a ride in the book that they're these programs Dallas has to convince city ... leaders that are beneath\nA the stench of failure there's at least a fine mist of success or and so when I was a senior I was chosen to be mayor of the day mayor for the day\nOr which is a program um by which uh uh one student from every high school public high school in Dallas was chosen to go down and shadow the mayor for the day\nAnd it turns out my uh Laura Miller had many years ago before I was even born the year before I was born a shadow my father a at a and try to\nReally use his story as a parable for the ways in which the system of high school and college football I'm really a choose young man up and spit stem out and blames at all on them and uh this book has a lot to say about that I Hope\nYou also talk about um you know football being about both sex and power especially as a as a matter of fact it in in Texas nice [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] well that's that's I'm not that he can sue me but that's a ... a say I want to give him credit he says everything in life is about sex except sex sex is about power and um and a Texas high school football essay is about\nYou know in in a lot of ways this book\nIs a sports book I thought it was very important actually\nTo right from the perspective of somebody who has played the sport you know so many sports books it especially now\nA very rightfully so are so critical of this game it means so much to so many of us even though we have suffered mightily far physically and otherwise um it it's a it's a beautiful beautiful experience transcending experience and I try\nTo capture that but also the football material in the book operates is sort of a political metaphor when I was a freshman at Yale the team was horrible\nAnd uh my class of freshman wherever thirty of us many of whom had no business at Yale I'm but were decent football players actually so we staged a coup against the upper class men as freshmen and took over the team\nAnd I write about us as being a week to calm that some collective trauma had transformed the nature of the collective itself\nHad creative within a team of a hundred and twenty people team with entertain a week to come and we went on to be the most successful class and a generation won a championship almost one second\nI think we're in a very similar moment here in America there has been such a collective trauma or to occur in my generation and beyond that and I think we're in the early days of a beautiful and sort of dangerous revolution or in terms of the ways we live in\nThe world in terms of the ways that we organize and participate in this society uh and I think that revolution of starting on the inside just as that football revolution started with twelve kids\nYou know standing on the sidelines say on while these upper class and I'm really sucked we got to take their jobs and I think some of that is happening as a political level than American I tried to capture them in the book as well\nWe're talking about your mom I'm before you knew anything about bipolar disorder you have memories of her um I guess when you're just a really small kid ... memories of her laughing and crying more than anybody else you knew for a longer duration\nYou remember her suffering a seizure driving you to school how did you make sense of all that and did anybody talk to you about it\nMhm [noise] um no no one spoke to me about it uh\nAnd [noise] you know one of the things people sometimes criticize me for about this book or in general are tend to criticize right as far as what you don't have any solutions what's the alternative\nAnd actually I have a whole ... page list of alternative that I might publish at some point one of which is to tell the truth to children ... um when I was writing this book my mother who is such a magical and was such a magical creature she disappeared when I was Thirteen\nAnd came back when I was Eighteen or ... you know in that time I assume she was dead and so she sort of I guess ... raises herself from the dead and returns when I'm Eighteen\nBut while I was writing this book she started disappearing yeah I mean you know a mental illness is something that is so horribly addressed in our society and and and so I've learned a lot from my mother about this anyway and when she started disappearing again as I was writing this book my niece\nWas twelve and a it was so heartbreaking to see her go through without going through at the same age\nAnd be able to even without her say any bank kind of know um you know she start checking on people just out of the blue you know made this very small things that on the surface do same particularly troubling\nBut I think I'm I recognized in them so many of the ways that I Try to bring some order to the world um when everything else seemed to be falling apart and one of the things this book to help me to do was to\nActually have honest conversation with my niece about this very traumatic thing that was going on first of all to tell her that\nAll those negative things that she feels about my mother a ... totally fine and valid you know I have a whole paragraph\nIn the book when my mother retire as I say I want it to disfigured her you know I had to be honest about that very raw negative hatred that I felt for this person who met a great deal to me doing something really horrible so that's the first thing I wanted to do with my niece and with other young people who are going through this\nThe nastiest Ross feelings you have about these awful things they're okay one to a that's not the end of it\nYou see you're not alone or there's something on the other side of that pain and that trauma\nBut third and this is perhaps the most important thing one of the most important things in this book and then I've learned um I had to uh right past my pain\nTo see my mother as a human being not as my employee you see and when I did that I realized that the worst thing that ever happened to me was actually perhaps the most important thing that she ever did for her so\nShe has to get away from all the stuff that was killed in her and uh and I really do understand that and so in some ways I tell people my mother reminds me a bit of blanche dubois from streetcar named desire where she was really I mean if you made a she's a big star mass she's great um [noise] but um but I\nCouldn't just tell the story nor should we tell any story\nFrom one perspective I had to tell the story of here as a free person trying to figure out how to live in a world\nThat caused them crazy and then take them seriously and and really kind of cuts them up and spit it's about it's\nSo interesting that you were able to get there because no matter what um when your mother leaves and has any amounts of volition and doing that it it's kind of feel personal it's kind of feel like it was about you even if it was\nWhen I write in the book if ever your mother asked you to choose between her death and disappearance have heard that ... always though not immediately of course\nMy my editor who was fantastic I mean she really I'm a thank God for her every day she wanted to take that out you know she's a mother she says case I think that's a bit harsh I said well yeah it is harsh that's why I'm putting it in the book is also the Senate hope\nBut you know death is clean you know a dozen elegance to its you know I mean it's very expensive my my thoughts of mortician and my gosh the the the rates they charge people to bury folks these days is absurd but [noise] um but a death is clean and the disappearance is a real close to\nAnd it creates this lingering sense of\nUncertainty this deal that thirty one years old you know I went to therapy or the other day and my therapist um\nWas five minutes late and her name wasn't on the board and I said oh my God she's taking my money Iran you know I mean I had to lift thirty one years old\nHave this paranoia that everybody's gonna lay and it's going to take me a long time perhaps anybody who experienced is that a long time to work through my my guest is Casey Gerald we're talking about his memoir there will be no miracles here will come back to the conversation in too many\nUm\nSense that this person had about the difference between to a person who happens to be gay and faggot is an act of violence and if it's not an act of violence against me it's an act of violence against the people\nThat she does see as vagabond on the street or people doing their hands like that are against the transgender women who are murdered at alarming rates everyday\nUh either all of us are going to be faggot or none of us can be ... and that is something that in the language\nOr in this book I Try to bring worthy language to the beauty and challenge of love and another boy in my case a in a society that hates maggots and teaches us to hate ourselves and so I I I say after that line in the book that if that word seems harsh\nIssue it\nI go on to explain why so is so important I mean especially in this moment of you know um we've got an individual lead in the country who has such um [noise] a a dangerous willingness to let language loose\nFar the most base\nToxic purposes or I don't believe the response to that is to button language up just to make it seem\nThere were no black people I think the point of languages to let it all loose for the right reasons not for the wrong reasons and that's what I Try to do with this very political it's not just the linguistic intervention is a political intervention to put myself over there\nOkay um because otherwise I'm complicit and the violence done on other people\nI don't want to go to the phones now our number is one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to we have them on the on the line in Dallas Hi\nAri I wanted to say I love your show great and thank you for having me on moving Oscars show\nNow I'm ... I Want to ask you mention it great powerful light and that that in their\n... ... ... when it comes to the mother it's easier to tell a child that you buy their arteries\nAct the way then disappeared what do you feel is um is that your tank bearing that you have when one is incarcerated and the care about and what you've been through\nAnd children of incarcerated parents\nThanks for your call that's such a great question um because I remember going to lose Sterritt jail to visit my father\nAnd I had to be very honest about this in the book I had no interest at all and going to jail to visit anybody I mean you know I I I've always felt it a bit\nStrange that you know children are dragged down in the jail like they've\nCommitted a crime or something I mean is a very strange thing I felt it was a strange thing for me\nAs a kid um [noise] but but if it's a it's a little different I think the structural a reality that lead to mass incarceration wished which are so insane and\nA and not to mention a arrayed against\nA especially black people in this country uh I mean the\nStructural reality is so clear I mean you can just go read Michelle Alexander and you know um what actually is going on here which is why one of the other alternatives that I have\nA you know and this ... page list is free everybody from jail I mean really as this is just you know if we really are talking about trying to get to justice just let everybody out of jail man I mean you know that would be a lot more skeptical than the inhumane a approach we're taking down but\nUh this is not a book about mass incarceration it is a book about what it looks like to raise free hold healthy children and um and I think uh it's very important and I talked to a lot of\nFriends of mine who have no partners who are incarcerated in our raising children of those partners um to think about what the kid needs not just think about what you want\nAnd um and sometimes just as simple as having a conversation you know a friend of mine who's a actually ask her daughter hey do you want to go see\nYour dad and sometimes the girl says yes sometimes to girl says no no\nI I think that simple act of I'm teaching children that they have a voice and including in their voice to the simple phrase no the simple act of refusal I think that's a very radical and loving thing that we need to do more of a chosen\nThis just think I'm ... so Casey\nYou mentioned earlier that um when you got to a gal as a freshman I'm among some of the freshmen on the team where people who maybe had no business academically at Yale but we're really going to football ... you were academically qualified to get ... but it took you a while to realize that you belong there\n[noise] [noise] well it took me a long time to belong there\n... you\nSee my first year\nOr a an academic advisor who I probably would have dropped out without her and I really appreciate\nAppreciate so much of what she did um even if it hit downsides but she said a head on the fittest ... when I when I met with her and she said we'll take your hat off that's okay she says gee where those around campus\nAnd so yeah\nShe says oh no Casey you can't do that is just so ... you know a stereotypical whether she was someone athletes black people or whatever [noise]\nUm [noise] she says you're at Yale now you don't have to do that anymore [noise] uh\nThe reality and this is one of the big interventions of this book is that the standard of success that we have in this society demands\nA sort of mutilation from so many people young people especially people from the right side of the tracks places like a cliff and you know I'm In LA's places like\nCompton or you know I go to New Orleans places like the Lower Ninth ward a demands of sort of mutilation shortly after I started this book one of my closest friends from Yale\nA kid whose child that had been much like mine Spanish kid or who's like little brother to me and that helped recruit him\nUm he took his own life and I'm not long after that you came to me in a dream and he was sitting in a booth in a in a diner and I got into the\nPart of the book where I have to start writing about my time at Yale and when I went there there were posters put up in every school in Dallas with my face on to say look who's going to Yale he did it you can too\nAnd I was ... start writing about this and I got so sad and I couldn't write and I took a nap aided by low bourbon which is like the right as best friend [noise]\nAnd uh and my friend came to me and the stream and he was sitting in this booth in this crowded diner any lean back and he said you know ... we did a lot of things that we wouldn't advise anybody we loved to do ...\nAnd I knew exactly what he meant I knew that if you look at it from the right angle\nAboard picking himself up by his bootstraps looks just like a suicide and I felt at my job in this book to confess to make playing those things and hopefully to keep or some other young people are the young people in my generation of young people who are in elementary school today\nFrom feeling that pressure to um mutilate themselves to put themselves in little boxes to leave half of themselves at home and take half of themselves to you you see\nTo feel that that bargain his worth and\nA and to really um hopefully imagine what it looks like to truly live you know to hold and free and\nUm and uh and and a half that sense of repair um that so many of our institutions uh convince us is not even on the table\nMy guest is author Casey Gerald his memoir is called there will be now miracles here if you'd like to join us call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think E R e dot org are good at Twitter and find
