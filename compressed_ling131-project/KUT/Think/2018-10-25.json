NPR station\nK. U. T. K. U. T. H. D. one often were on line at K. U. T. dot org and we are community support it public radio from UT Austin think is coming up next Jimmy mosque joins you for the afternoon NPR News headlines or one minute past one o'clock I have a great Thursday\nIf Madison didn't really want this and allowed Congress to declare war I mean Congress declared war um was it a problem that I have too much democracy\nOr it was in that you know to an extent he was saying let Congress have what it wants but he could have used a lot of moral authority to say this is this is the wrong thing to do and this is not what we had intended in Philadelphia and I can testify to that as a founding father\nAnd in the prologue to the book I have the tale of August of Eighteen fourteen about two years into the war where\nI say it's almost rough justice because James Madison and Dolly Madison were fleeing the White House to escape being hang by the British were invading Washington were burning the capital burning the White House\nAnd so they're they are running through the forest looking for each other Madison and Dolly the dark Virginia forest at night with rain coming down and Madison is galloping on his horse and even though it's dangerous because the British British are catching up to him and want to kill him and displaying as a battle trophy\nHe cats he can't help himself he keeps on getting off of this horse and turning around and looking with logging and fear\nAnd perhaps a sense the had done the wrong thing and seeking this war he's looking at the image of Washington across the Potomac River disappearing in a spoiler fire\n[noise] um is it fair to say that um [noise] somebody Madison's position\nLike paid an emotional price as well for the mistakes that he made I mean it's a it's a through line I didn't expect and it's not that every president has dealt with the war whether they were gun how or not\nIt come out of it just just Savage I mean ... you have to fight aggressive Lincoln in the bucket there four years apart and honest to God looks like he's aged Thirty years with Madison the first one to kind of feel that he\nWas and he has an illness during this war that is almost fatal and his wife thought came very much from his upset of being a war president causing people to die and also maybe he had done the wrong thing and that's you know it's one reason why I call this the presidents of war because it's\nAbout a group of about eight or nine men who had the singular experience and they all alone had it in the whole of American history of\nWaging a major war isn't sending large number of ... numbers of Americans off to die and they have some things in common a lot of them have emotional breakdowns LBJ as a great example of that you know I use these tapes of his\nTo get into his head you know the secret tapes he made his private conversations which I did two books on uh some time ago on\nNineteen sixty four sixty five but these covered the later years which I have not covered before\nAnd he gets more suspicious and he gets more angry and it gets more wound up Woodrow Wilson had a stroke they also physical breakdowns Franklin Roosevelt had progressive\nCardiovascular disease so that's one thing they all become with almost no exception more religious even Abraham Lincoln who was a young man was considered to be almost an atheist\nWhen he was a war president one of his old friends comes to see him and says I'm so shocked to see reading the Bible and Lincoln says you know I Can't imagine that anyone would not become more religious going through this experience Lady Bird Johnson told me that late in the Vietnam War she thought her husband Lyndon was going to become a Catholic\nBecause their daughter Lucy who converted to Catholicism at the age of sixteen took her dad to Catholic Mass and he\nFound such comfort with the men who Lucy called my little amongst down at the church that you'd like to go to\nSo another thing is that you really find religion becoming very important in the lives of some of these war presidents where it had not been at all\nDid James Cape ... find religion because it's\nLike he was he was led us or\nHe only did at the very end he got himself baptized almost on his deathbed but I Wish you had had more religion because I think he was a very bad man he did some good things he ensure the Texas is what it is today which I'm all for your oh four\nBut he did a terrible thing he was a liar and he was a scoundrel and he was a bully and\nA newly and the presidency he contrived a border incident that anyone in who knows Texas history will know at least some version of so that Mexicans would come across the river and attack Americans in a very small way\nAnd poke did this deliberately had sent Zachary Taylor soldiers down they're hoping that this would happen so that he could go to Congress which he did and say we need an immense war against Mexico all the way down to Mexico City what she knew it would take a very long time\nAnd he said his purpose was to retaliate for what the Mexicans have done to us in this incident and also if his intent we prevent that we performed\nSo this was the first case of something we regrettably I ride a lot about in this book these fake incidents the president's either stage or exploit that stampede Americans to get into wars and if they otherwise would not support\nBut pokes ulterior motive which he did not tell anyone didn't even tell a secretary of state but it's all in his diary was\nHe wanted to have a war with Mexico so that he could get under very favorable terms nearly a million square miles of\nTerritory from Texas up from Mexico incorporated into the United states so that we would become continental nation from Atlantic Pacific very worthy name but he didn't have to do it like a semi criminal\nHow could have done it without a without starting a major war\nHe could've negotiated with the Mexicans are offered a large price for it that's the way it's usually done\nUh and as I say this was a case of ends versus means I Love the and I love the fact the taxes is secure I was just in California I'm Glad it's part of the United states but the whole dream of the founders and Seventeen Ninety seven was that we would do things the right way honestly as straightforwardly\nAnd poke was really a cheat from beginning to end\n[noise] um there have always been people who saw through these defections um when they've occurred why didn't anybody why wasn't anybody able to stand up to Polk and say we're not going to do that\nIt was something that you've seen as a theme all through American history which is that once American Soldiers are engaged and there's a natural feeling among Americans you want to support the troops it's very hard for someone to get up and say we should stop this they're not there for the ride struggle\nAnd my view is that true American history the protesters have had a very important role but also was seen by the founders you know you go back to the monarchies of Europe there weren't any protesters when there were war's declared because these were absolute monarchies the founders\nFelt that in our society there's a place for those who are protesting against the war the way of wars fought for instance because that makes presidents and congresses\nThey have a little bit more wisely but there were some people who oppose the ... of the Mexican war in late Eighteen forty seven there was a young congressman who rose on the floor of the house and he said\nBasically I think this incident of pokes that causes this war was a fake you show me the spot he said that the Mexicans attack I'll bet you can't find it and be congressman who was so brave in opposing post war was none other than Abraham Lincoln in Illinois\n[noise] did his experiences opposing poking doubting what had happened shaped away Lincoln decided to deal with the secession Barry thanks\nVery much so because Lincoln was an idealist but at the same time he was a very tough guy\nAnd for instance as he began to fight his word wages were against the secession us he was not going to do this with one hand tied behind his back he suspended habeas corpus he did other things that lead people have the time to say that\nHe was trying to be a tyrant or a dictator himself and I think that was not wrong he was doing things that even went outside the constitution [noise]\nWrong thing but remember I was talking about ends versus means he felt it was necessary to win the war and in his defense I Would say two things number one lake and kept on saying whatever I'm doing that seems questionable my word is but that's what he was trying to say\nI Want it known to all future presidents that I'm not intending to set a precedent that some later president in a much less challenging situation\nCan use and the other thing is that I looked all through Lincoln's life and particularly what he did and said during his presidency I Can't find any evidence that he did this out of lust for power\nThere are other presidents in American history who have\nCut corners and broken laws I think to become a more powerful person\nMy guest is historian and author Michael ... we're talking about his new book presidents of war the ethics story from Eighteen is seven to modern times\nIt's going to join us we have lined up and now at one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email ... R. A. dot org or find this on Twitter AT T E R a thing\n\nTo\nI talked to a CIA director Richard Richard Holmes who died years ago and he told me that LBJ almost every single day was asking me have you got the evidence yet that the reason why all these students are on the campus is demonstrating is because the communist or paying\nAnd Johnson a sad to others the reason why these senators are against the war like William Fulbright the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is because they're getting paid off by\nChinese Communist while they were not many Chinese Communist surround in Washington DC in Nineteen sixty but he could never admit to himself that someone on the other side could have a legitimate reason to criticize or oppose his war\nAnd you know Benjamin Franklin once said you're a critic as your friend but we all get annoyed at our critics but in Johnson's case his credit could never be his friend was always his enemy and increasingly he felt that way as the war wound down and as his mind got more and more troubled\nAnd Jack Kennedy also ... I mean ... Johnson also had ... people telling him Jack Kennedy would have\nIn the village of the piece is Robert McNamara and I don't use words like if it wasn't very often\nThis was an opportunist who had been John Kennedy's defense secretary and wanted power under Lyndon Johnson after JFK was assassinated so McNamara early in the Vietnam War detected the Johnson's instinct was probably to be tougher than Kennedy so he told him what he wanted to hear and\nSaid you know Mr President you know you have to go whole hog and Vietnam because that's what you have Kay would have done I Know this is his defense secretary well I think that's very questionable I think that McNamara basically did it to butter Johnson up and get more power and justice ... Johnson had always feared he always feared that\nPeople would take advantage of him then turned against him by Nineteen sixty seven Maximo was saying the war is a loser and it was all Johnson's fault fortunately for LBJ he had taped a lot of their conversation so that McNamara could not escape blame\nMy guest is Michael Beschloss historian and author we're talking about his book presidents of war the ethics story from Eighteen oh seven can modern times [noise]\nAll right um so we we we there's so many wars it turned out to the land grab opportunities I Want to talk a little bit about ... billion McKinley um how in the world did the U.S for a time really become a true colonial power under McCain like well\nThat's the thing of you know ends versus means if you like the fact that we're a world power you know let's put a flower in front of the portrait of William McKinley\nBut he did it in a terrible way because uh Eighteen Ninety eight we had a ship not for a large ship called the main the main was in Havana Harbor the main young the uh the ship was sunk and everyone said remember the Maine and tabloids in New York We're saying we Spanish who sank are shipped this is a terrible thing\nSo Congress exceeded to William McKinley is request to go to war with Spain only one little problem Chris uh the ship was sunk actually by a boiler accident I guess you couldn't go to war against boilers to Ninety eight\nSo Americans were brought up and furious against Spain and we have to avenge the sinking of the ship so we conquered the Philippines and we did the same with ... we did the same thing with Puerto Rico and we liberated Cuba from really nasty\nSpanish tyranny and that was a good deed but the point is that was sort of like ... with the border incident\nWe went through this large war based on a fake incident that never existed you know terrible for our democracy\nAnd their lessons here about how easy it is to spin the American public up into support for wars that are not justifiable in the long term\nAnd the danger here is that one day it may lead and unscrupulous president to stage a fake incident of his own in order to get Americans tobacco war that otherwise they would not support a a Nineteen sixty four you know another example of variation of this was the Gulf of Tonkin incident\nLBJ was dealing with reports he had of an incident firing on American ship in the Gulf of talking and he went on television said there's been an incident an unprovoked attack against American ship while he knew what the time but\nIf there was an attack it was not unprovoked because we were doing all sorts of things to talk of the north Vietnamese and little boats that were there\nAnd so he went to Congress got this Gulf of Tonkin resolution almost unanimous for the next almost a decade he and Richard Nixon wage this war almost sixty thousand Americans dead based on those flimsy\nGulf of Tonkin resolution\nAnd appointing a thing as the privately Johnson found out within a few weeks that there had never been any incident after all the report had been falls so\nBasically that whole war was waged on the basis of a resolution passed on a uh in in retaliation for an incident that didn't happen\nTo think I'm Chris Boyd\nSupport comes from this friday's party at the plant and be seen afro beat celebrating the new art exhibition making Africa a continent of contemporary design details on Facebook or a plant and museum dot org slash after all the\nSupport comes from idea public school's health professions now enroll in kindergarten first second in sixth grade for fall twenty Nineteen and education focused on creating health professionals for the twenty first century updates on Facebook and idea health professions\nSupport comes from UT paralegal certificate program available online or in class and completed in less than five months on line into session Wednesday November twenty eight more professional ed dot U.
