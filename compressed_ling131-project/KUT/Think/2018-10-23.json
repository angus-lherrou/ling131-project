U. T. K. U. T. H. D. one Austin where on line at K. U. T. dot org and we are community support it public radio from U. T. Austin sixty four degrees in the capital city NPR News headlines are next think is coming up\nJust passed news headlines Jimmy monsters and to take it through the rest of the afternoon programs forty percent chance of showers\nThey expected near well written sixty four when asked one\nYou are buried swiftly and sediments um that then preserve your remains and keeps them away from like scavengers or foul weather that scattered your bones all over 'em all over the surface of the earth\nAnd then rock layers and build up around you and you are groundwater because bone is porous groundwater seats into the bones and eventually turns um\n[noise] turns the bones to um to rock so it it it it's both a it's\nKind of a misnomer that that fear well it's not a misnomer fewer than one percent become puzzles but that sounds both rare and it ... your right to say that it's\nIt's still a lot so there's there's a lot out there to be found um but it's still fairly rare conditions that that that create that create that lead to the\nCreation of fossils okay some most of us picture paleontologist wearing a you know like ... and a and charts and a big floppy hats but\nCommercial paleontologists can use that title without ever having taken so much as an undergraduate course in paleontology what sort of people are calling themselves commercial paleontologists they've\n[noise] that's right they uh the dealers a lot of them do and there's ... there's there's a real divide there about what about what\nThere's not a divide in terms of the science science is a science a paleontologist is deeply educated in\nUm the sciences and the maps and um all of the collateral um disciplines to go into studying the history of life on Earth I'm the commercial guys\nI don't know how it got started they started calling themselves commercial paleontologists but they they sort of justify it by saying that paleontology is the study of fossils and that they are studying fossils\nAnd it's it's splitting hairs and semantics I'm but they feel totally justified in doing so even though the scientists say no we you know it takes years to earn\nThe credibility and the credentials to call ourselves paleontologist we're paleontologists and you are commercial honors which has led to some of the you know that that\nI could say class divide between or any logical divide between the guys who are out there hunting strictly for commercial purposes and the guys who do this as a as a as an academic pursuit\n[noise] the central character in your book is this guy Eric per copy 'em for him it started with sharp teeth when he was a swimmer is a little bit more about him\nHe grew up in ... Florida which is right near Tampa I'm his his father was an elementary school music teacher his mother um was a cafeteria cook and had other a jobs\nAnd it was very entrepreneurial spirit and in practice and loved to be outside and so did ... for a copy as a child he was always outside and Florida is a remarkable place to be outside because it's\nSo lush and I'm learner dinosaurs there but it's just absolutely sick with a vice age creatures an including the mega fauna\nOf of that time and he has not had\nHis mother would take him around the neighborhood and they would walk together and ride bikes together and pick things up whatever it was that looked interesting they would pick it up on it might be cans that they would then sell for money um [noise]\nOr just anything interesting they took it home they're ... they're all collectors in some way the ... his father build collected opera\nAlthough ... his mother collected beer signs from her native Germany and other things and Eric when he picked up his first shark too which is in Venice, Florida\nWhich is down in the panhandle and calls itself the shark tooth capital of the world I'm very interesting place a sound as first sharp tooth and it just became fascinated with what creature\nHad produced it and how the creature lived and when the creature lived and in fact in Venice is just so so uh but there's so many sharp teeth invented um hence the festival but uh it was easy to find them and and he got hooked\nOn natural history just by finding a sharp teeth and wondering about the different species of sharks which then led to collecting sharp jaws city compare this feces on his his initial interest was both driven I think by um being outdoors connecting to natural history and then wondering about the scientific\nA past of each of these animals\nSo normally we hear a story about a kid like this and we expect him to study marine biology or paleontology or or one of the sciences but that's not the route that Arab for copy one\n[noise] no it's not he ended up going to he collected all through his childhood I mean from the time he was five years old and he's he's never done anything else this is this has been truly his life\nUm he ended up going to the University of Florida on partial scholarship and graduated very high in his ... landed lakes high school class a smart guy\nAnd went to the University of Florida and a partial academic scholarship and was a swimmer and went on the swim team for a little while until his studies became challenging and he had to get something out to get a choice between giving up the swimming the swim team um or or the fossils and he chose to give up the swim team and stick with the fossils\nAnd he was studying at Florida a engineering which is no small business small discipline it was it was incredibly hard and\nUm and he and he stuck with that he felt I asked him watch why he didn't study paleontology or some discipline related to it geology um\nThose types of ... and while he did take the science says he didn't pursue that as a discipline he told me because he didn't like the thought\nOf having to you how do I say this he he didn't want to be an academic he wanted to be independent he wanted to search for\nThe remains a extinct remains on his own without having to um [noise] follow academic\nProcedures and and to just live in the academic world that he found I Would imagine that he found somewhat stifling he'd always been a pretty independent free spirit and\nAnd I think he'll who has [noise] yeah I think he also thought that there wouldn't be much of an income and then I'm\nIn academia so he did go ahead and graduate with two degrees or a double degree in engineering but then\nA pursuit fossils fulltime is all he wanted to do\nSo he gets this business going buying selling trading fossils um [noise] it's kinda feast or famine he's got a little family to support and things like that by a lot of expensive stuff and then they hold out until you know the next big payout\nRight and that was that's the way a lot of the big dealers I think it's accurate to say that that's the way that a lot of the big dealers live in his feast or famine that's what a Amanda Eric first wife used to tell people when they would ask about their livelihood she would say you know we [noise]\nUm [noise] do big projects and pay off all our bills and then reinvest and the and the company and then um you know it's tight for a while and then we make another big sale and and we're going to get we pay our people we pay our bills\n[noise] we um sees me we um [noise] uh by\nIn their case properties they were flipping properties the Amanda is a she's a brilliant designer and she had gotten interested in the idea of flipping old houses\nAnd turning them into um you know income [noise] um\nSo they were investing in that and and yeah it's um it's a precarious way to live but it's the way a lot of these guys live\nAgainst his New Yorker staff writer page Williams talking about her book the dinosaur artist obsession betrayal and the quest for the earth ultimate trophy when we return to the conversation why you may not be seeing the dinosaur you think you're seeing when you visited museum in\nMuseums what what people don't understand when they're falling through and looking these glorious things is that I'm ... years who work at a museums often have to fill in ... parts with like parts from either the same species or another cc's that's after a short break [noise]\n\n... [noise]\n\nSupport comes from Potter Potter a play of all seven Harry Potter books in Seventy comedy ... minutes eight performances with a live magic which November thirteenth through Eighteen but at the paramount tickets at Austin theater daughter worn\nYou know like this this may sound funny but like from the junk drawer from from bones that he had a sitting around from similar shipments from Mongolia I mean they were they were Mongolian bones I Believe but um it was not all one creature which is often the case\nSo where is his works I mean I picture him like out in the garage with the lawnmower [laughter] it's just you know three feet away where where did you do with his work he started\nIn the garage he he he always had worked anger in his own garage um until he got into dinosaurs and knew that he would need a larger space because these were gigantic creatures and he at that time lived and he and his wife had restored\nI'm a glorious old house called Sarah Noah in Gainesville, Florida and uh [noise] in the backyard beyond the swimming pool is sort of it's kind of a remote area near pains prairie a state park which is another glorious place so it's kind of out\nOn its own and and sort of wild back there and he put a five thousand square foot prefabricated\nWarehouse workshop uh back there and there was plenty of room he could put his boats in there you could put all his storage all his tools back there um he planned to build an office uh there was there was enough height and the net building to sort of added a second\nFloor upstairs who's going to put an office up there um and ...\nWhere he spent most of his time he was a workaholic oh yeah a ... and it was an issue in his marriage sometimes\n[noise] yeah I mean this was their main source of income other than flipping flipping is a ... is a is a is a sort of speculative operation to you know fossils speculative I'm flipping speculative you you need buyers and the back end you're putting all this work and energy and time and money into something\nHoping that somebody is going to be interested in it some day um it's not unlike writing books [laughter]\nDoing art or a ... all the other things that you just put your life blood and two and then and then hope that somebody's interested um and\n... and it yeah he he um he he\nWas working so hard and he had so many Mongolian fossils coming in from his supplier Newell and by the time that they were just coming by the caseload and he had a lot a lot to do and he wanted to get a lot out the door so that he could pay off debts\nThat that he had gotten himself and I want to spoil the book for anybody but he'd gotten himself into a little bit of a corner there and was looking for a a good payout\nSo page do you have to declare this stuff at the border like when you're importing it is there a whole bunch of paperwork\nYou're supposed to file out to say that you have fossilized dinosaur roaming yeah yeah [laughter]\nI have to say that it's you have to say and in and he did in some cases safe\nAre labeled the shipments fossils but in other cases\nDealers have been known to I'm Mark I make\nMiss declarations on the customs and border protection forms\nAnd on homeland security does not uh does not like that they want you to tell the truth about what you're bringing into the country and rightly so um but lots of fossils have gotten through\nBeing called like quote unquote samples of craft rock or um one shipment of Chinese muscles came through labeled issues\nUm than there have been dinosaur eggs and all kinds of other things and sometimes they're labeled um you know\nRock just plain rock\nUm and other times they actually say fossils that until recently the guy and the agents federal agents didn't really know what to to look for I've been told by federal agents and and on\nFederal prosecutors said that this case is open your eyes to what to look for 'em and this and sunny and actually at the trains federal agents now or has has trained at least one set of federal agents on how to how to spot on fossils illicit fossils coming through and also their significance\nThey think I'm Chris Boyd\nSupport comes from if the
