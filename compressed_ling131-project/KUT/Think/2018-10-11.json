politicians comedians journalists authors and actors in recent days\nThe BBC's ... following the story she is in Delhi and key to\nFirst start because it seemed to just erupt and here in the U.S the me too movement was largely launched by women speaking to an investigative journalist what's happening there\nOne I think you need to actually started oh wait\nA Bollywood actress a ... that are talking about a case of a vast meant that she faced about ten years ago and she had talked about it at the time too and they had they known as a new show and in fact she had said\nUh that drone strike up for her and that's how could you suffered a lot and then before we knew that I have a like several women to to be a social media to talk about that old cases\nAnd in fact one of the uh first one was\nA woman who worked in this very popular\nA comedy group or she may may see this allegation against\nOne of the uh main a comedian than this mine in tone apologized and he said that he had behaved badly so he admitted to it on Twitter he put out a CD of tweets um and then uh after that so it's just kind of taken on a life of its own\nUh in the past few days we've seen a seven women come out and name all kinds of people a lot of them actually from the media from the past\nWell you know it sounds as if when you talk about comedy troupe it will be as if somebody on Saturday Night live here in the states accused someone else of sending a photo of their body part which is what the male committee was accused of doing and he admitted to it and apologize there in India it seems huge how are people reacting they're\nWell it is so quite huge actually and I think that is so quite a bit of ...\nUm and what's happened what we've seen in the last few days they is that one women started talking about it didn't Twitter\nWe've seen really like a a flood of um Twitter messages from women calling out to a dead alleged houses and uh I think the largest number of people who've been named\nUh are in a kind of journalists right so you had a what you spoke about a Mr and jak but who is the\nAh junior foreign minister in India\nAnd in fact all the allegations about him but to the time when he was the editing newspapers\nOne of the ... cat it might take editors and uh you know in the last few days we've seen at least seven or eight women who have come out\nAnd do with the accounts of a document a shock but has not responded he is in fact the according to our reports he's in Nigeria on official tour\nAnd he's not responded to any of the allegations\nJournalist have also do steps government minister has to get a reaction from them to get it at bonds from them and we're still waiting to hear anything from anybody in the government\nDoorstep gone to their door steps to try to get them to respond well\nYes in fact the ah Mr Bush the boss to the uh the foreign minister so she ... she was stopped by journalists as she was leaving a conference\nAnd general is just ducked than a microphones in her faith asking how to respond and also appealing to the sense that she's a woman and she should take a stand on and\nOf course the ... did not say anything and she's gone off\nA look we know that at least one newspaper's promised an investigation after journalists accused their senior editor but you tell us that you know this has been sort of whispered um this this notion that senior editors were harassing and assaulting reporters younger women who worked beneath them\nSo they will which was all along in the newspapers across India at I mean you know uh I've been a gymnast for more than ... the U.S\nAnd uh I have only HUD and um you know we spoke about\nMisconduct by senior editor auto colleague so oh who use their positions of power to 'em to proposition and harassed younger uh women in fact we've also a mud in the last few days we've heard some really big names or who have also\nBeen accused of some form of harassment one of them is a very popular act to a Bollywood act out from the eighties\nUh called ... not so there are lots of big names that are now a set of starting to come out we've talked about it I'm In private meetings a photo of a long time but this is a first time I can see that you know we we have\nActually something like this that's being that sustained for the last few days ...\nAnd to see where it goes from here the BBC's ... in Delhi on their me to moment and\n\nFive thousand it's about\nSixteen thousand seven hundred so you know they were all kinds of predicts at the end of the world\nAnd on this I don't want to say that psychologically for psychological reasons we tend to never live in a golden age [laughter]\nYou know we never live in a golden age we only remember golden ages or we look forward to them with great anticipation but we are living in a golden age you would never know it from the coverage on a in the media um and he is there the stereo I Believe on on the left\nUm where you know the economy is doing great unemployment is way down corporate\nProfits are up consumer confidence is up so you know I think we're doing great um but you'd never know\nSo as I'm sure you've noticed there are a lot of people who really just dislike this president on a kind of visceral level but honestly that's been true of pretty much every president depending on you know which party is is in control people are either really behind their guy are really against the other guy on some objections are rational some objections are emotional\nIf there's something about Donald Trump specifically that makes people unusually blind to either his strengths or his weaknesses\nAre that's a great question I I I think it's because he has narcissistic tendencies them\nEven one who supports them he is you know he's in New York I'm In New York or I understand I I've met many people like him um\nHe's a he's very different than a politician he is the first like head of a corporation he's a CEO and we just never seen that before and he doesn't talk to people like a politician or you know he I I'm not saying all the others are are aggressive or\nOr you know um [noise]\nAlpha males or whatever but I I there's a sense that he's just not a great shift and he's he's clunky sometimes he's not he see like what\nWhat Obama what\nThe left loved about Obama was his soaring rhetoric they love soaring rhetoric I mean the media love soaring rhetoric and just don't get that usually from from Trump the wings at a and there's a sense of him he he he says what's on his mind he he's does nothing filtering his thoughts\nSo I think he's incredibly transparent\nAnd I I don't think that's a bad thing I think he's a president that would be exactly who he is in private as he is in public\nAnd to me that's a good thing but too many people particularly I Would say like the the foreign policy establishment and the media this is just you know this is just he's he's a bowl of a China shop he's just\nNothing like they've ever seen and um so they just can't stand him and I ... I think they they tend to misinterpret everything he says I'm you know ... I'm not saying he he he walks into it lots of times but I just don't like you know I was just listening to NPR\nAs before I got here and I'm listening to Max Boot excoriated Republicans and people who voted for Trump is\nThey're all racist that that you know it's the the Hillary Clinton they're deplorable and um I I just think that's such a miss miss characterization of the people who support Trump and Trump himself I don't I don't think he said all racist but I think he's a man of his time\nYou know he he he's he's not politically correct\nYou note that President Trump has continued the Obama era policy of avoiding large scale conventional war in the middle east but where Obama was criticized by many people for allowing Syria to sort of cross that red line into chemical weapons President Trump did launched an air strike in retaliation for ... use of this\nThe weapons on civilians can we say the Trump's actions will keep aside from the plane chemical weapons in the future\n[noise] no I you know I I think that's going too far um I that was a strange rather uncharacteristic\nIt it's not a very real is response so I Will say that but um because real is would say you know it it it was about human rights now having said that the United states an enormously\nPowerful country and so you know we can do all kinds of things that other countries can't dream of project power and I think that this was a case where Trump's all these children dying of nerve gas and it was appalling and he said well if we can go in there and\nAnd and you know a lot to an attack and and uh it won't cost us very much we have the military out there then let's do it and teach them a lesson\nI'm willing to do it again I don't know he's very unpredictable leader Bashar Assad so I Can't say but I think if he does it again he'll probably get the same treatment maybe a little worse than next on\n[noise] what is the ... down to push ISIS mostly out of Syria and Iraq\n[noise] well you know lots of things but uh [noise] they let the generals do more um ... up front you know that they gave them more power to do things on the ground I it's a complicated story I I wouldn't pretend to know all the details of how they did it but I just think Trump\nDeserves credit for\nThe fact that ISIS has been almost ... you know they are they still they're still around there on the Internet and things like that but for the most part ISIS\nIs gone and again I I don't hear anyone you know there's occasional talk about what a good thing that is but I don't hear it on places like CNN or MSNBC and I think most Americans are quite grateful that\nISIS is gone and I I'm not going to say the Trump is you know entirely responsible for that but he he certainly deserves some credit for that\nWell I think there and I'm not an expert in this part of world but there are people who would argue that it ... it wasn't like a unilateral us effort to push ISIS out ... the U.S is not on the ground in Syria there are a lot of other um there are a lot of other entities fighting ISIS and and that sounds like the kind of international effort that you're saying maybe isn't\nA great idea or isn't necessary in a in a realist political world there\nWell I I think it's a good outcome and like I say the United states has a extremely safe\nCountry I mean we are extremely ... secure maybe the world's most ... we are the world's most secure state the world has never seen a\nState more secure than we are so we can do things like get rid of ISIS that said I don't think that we should expand enormous amounts of blood and treasure to do so I'm In fact in the middle east I I really would think and I would\nHope that the U.S tries to get out of the middle east there's just nothing in it for us anymore and one of the good things Trump is done like Obama is avoid large scale war\nIn the middle east so whereas I'm happy that ISIS is gone I don't think I was a great threat to United States it was a very bad annoyance\nUm but that's about it so the fact\nThat we could get rid of ISIS and they wouldn't cost us a you know we didn't need a large scale invasion to do it that's a very good\n[noise] so President Trump has rejected many of the kind of foundational ideals of the liberal international order that his govern geopolitics really since the end of the second World War what kinds of activities would you say the U.S has taken on as a responsibility in the past as obligations\nWithout consideration to how much it would cost a domestically\nWell the middle east to do is think about what we've done in the middle east and what is it really gotten us very little of anything but I think this whole idea of ... that we engage in a social engineering\nSort of on a global scale with the rest of the world is highly interventionist foreign policy that was endorsed by both the left and the right whether it was liberal engage or is or or a neo conservatives on the right\nUm you know trying to make the world you know democratic promoting democracy you know this whole thing in the middle East that Bush started where who we're going to democratize the middle east\nAre these grandiose plan somehow you know\nA few guns will knock a few heads and will somehow have a ... democratize middle\nEast I'm just I'm\nI Would say like our foreign policy it's just been mismanaged\nFor two decades criminally so uh by the foreign policy established and whether it's you know what we did in Bosnia what we did in um [noise] uh Iraq Iraq Afghanistan Libya and you can even go back\nAs far as the Vietnam War but I'll just you know that's that's going back a ways but you know the the foreign policy establishes done a lot\nOf crazy things that have done nothing to further or dance American national security in fact all they've done is make things worse\n[noise] my guest is Randall ... professor of political science and director of the program for real is foreign policy at Ohio State university is an editor in chief at the journal security studies\nHis essay in foreign affairs magazine has come to re cheers for Trump's foreign policy looking back on the conversation in two minutes if you'd like to join us you can call eight hundred nine three three five three seven to find this on Twitter and he are a think\nTo [noise]\n\nWell Europe is about twenty times more wealthy than Russia Russia is like a gas station with nuclear weapons [laughter] what do we what do we need you know what what do we need to protect wealthy Europe from this\nYou know threat of Russia whatever you want to cause is not a threat but let's even assume they're correct what do we need is why it's crazy to me that\nThe dialogue and the narrative is that the rest of the world is doing a favor by letting us protect\nThem you know we don't need Japan what ... what do we care you know ... if we leave I Believe if there'll be much more sat and much less secure than America will feel upset and insecure All right let's\nGo to the phones our number is one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to we have David on the line and tell my Hi David\n[noise] yeah Hi how are you thank you for taking my call sir I'm calling just because I Want to take\nUmbrage with what uh what's your guess at the beginning of the program\nThat the left has a problem with a Donald Trump because he doesn't have soaring rhetoric [noise] um it's far more and more serious than the fact that Mr Trump does speak with soaring wherever they personal\n[noise]\nThe human qualities that Trump is on a daily basis or what the left has\nA country that's supposed to look out for is weaker sort of a spouses to be fair and give her credit for all the people who live in its borders we have someone who is um has exhibited or at least\nParticipated in races rhetoric um espousing a strict\nBehavior such a bully behavior\nUm I'm an educator I've been an educator for almost Thirty years and the personal characteristics that he exhibits on the world stage as leader of this country are characteristics that we do not allow in any of our school age children\nAll right David thank you so much I really appreciate uh I really appreciate your calling or do you want to respond to that random\nI just feel like you know he says he engages in racist comments were what in particular did he say that you think is race is um you know\nI think a lot of people have seen the president's responses to 'em pretty significant ah situations I'm ... and has he has seen as if he was not particularly concerned about uh attacks on on people and you know black lives matter demonstrators that sort of thing\nOh I I just disagree I Know I don't see that at all in fact\nNow I I I I I think um\nI also think I ever forgive me I I'm a white person and I you know typically if a person of color says something is racist I I tend to\nBelieve them when you know I\nDon't think that that's a reason to believe someone but you know I don't think the color of a person's skin\nA is a\nDetermining whether they're true to say or not because I think that people of the same color skin will disagree I'm On what they see and hear\n'em I think what Trump does is like I say he is not he's not um self\nAware of how his remarks can be interpreted\nAnd and what we see is a very generous interpretations of what he's saying\nUm and we could just go through every remark I mean you have to go through each individual case and I will show you what I think he is saying what I'm confident that he's saying and that's not racist but this is you know people want to believe is racist you know\nThey've been calling Republicans racist for decades and decades decades I just have to disagree with that\nIs my guest is Randall ... he is professor of political science and director of the program for realist foreign policy at Ohio State university and listening to think I'm Chris boy\nI don't want to talk a little bit about a trade deals ... what was once called NAFTA has been replaced by an agreement now known as the United states Mexico Canada agreeing that it was negotiated between the U.S and each other partners separately what's the advantage the U. S. pursuing bilateral trade and security deals rather than multinational partnerships\nOr multilateral isn't yeah as I said earlier you if you um [noise]\nSee multiculturalism multilateral deals are designed to place limits on their returns to power in a sense that's\nWhere and by that when I mean is that you have it's much harder for the U.S to use its bargaining leverage in bargaining power in a multilateral setting [noise] um [noise] so\nYou know\nThe Trump was pointing out when he was doing renegotiating NAFTA Mexico is a very different country from Canada and so it makes a lot more sense to negotiate with them individually than it does collectively\nUm some observers have worried and you address this in the piece that President Trump is looking to dismantle NATO first of all do you think that that's true have you seen indications of that as the gays\nHe wants to ... those are his instincts but he kept he ... he has hire people that are more foreign policy establishment types like Rex Tillerson and then I think my my pump patio and\nMadison certainly John Bolton and um I don't think these people actually they're not radical and their views on foreign policy is way Trump is\nTrump's instincts are and I think they are correct that NATO is obsolete\nBut she she's not going to be able to dismantle NATO though I I Will say of people of that I respect greatly\nUh out right after the Cold War back in Nineteen Ninety One said that maybe NATO's days are numbered but it's ... years are so this is not something that is radical from the perspective of let's say real is very famous real is Ken and I'm a chemist waltz I'm\nVery very respected real said that\nNATO to see the point about alliances that their their greatest enemy of an alliance of success once you defeat the enemy the alliance is supposed to break up\nBut NATO has not broken up and you know the the question is who is NATO what is what is the target of NATO and some would respond well maybe it was designed to um keep America in ... Germany down and keep the Russians out maybe it's still doing the same thing I don't know\n[noise] do you think Americans who have concerns about the president's apparently college all relations with vitamin ... and with Russia um are are worried about nothing should should we be concerned that Russia could pose a military or an economic or a geopolitical threat to the United states\nRussia cannot pose an economic or military threat to United States and you know we have a lot that we can do in concert with the Russians\nBut our relationship is right now and solve the rails and I I again I think Trump's instincts are correct that there is you know we don't have to love them you're pointing to recognize that we have interests in common and that we should try to\nBe on good terms with them the Russians and I\nHonestly I think um Russia has been misunderstood and in many ways I'm not saying that ... is a perfect leader but what happened in Ukraine there is there are two sides to that story\nFor example just to point out the obvious um you know the rebels who overthrew the Ukrainian government overthrew a democratically elected government\n... and then they outlawed Russian language so I mean imagine that the shoe or on the other foot and this had happened to the United states in its backyard in its influence I you know we might have responded to\nSo ... says why wouldn't the Russians ... absolutely All right let's go back to the phones are number one eight hundred nine three three five three [laughter]\nHere we have\nI think for taking my call sir I'm my question comment however you want to embrace that is about our lack a strategic foreign policy out of the democracy that changes and they report eight years\nAnd he was an ear like China they're able to put a fifth year plan in place and just keep marking that he'd be the one from exactly my answer off air\nAlright yeah this has been a concern for you know\nBefore they even the Cold War but certainly when the Cold War started everyone was worried that America has had a great disadvantage because you know we we have elections and the Russians they they can do whatever they want you know because they have strong leaders but it turned out that the American government American democracy\nIs actually far better than in ...\nSystem because we have checks and balances and we have greater information and we tend to be smarter because we do have\nA free press and checks and balances and all those kinds of things that\nThat's sad I mean we've done a lot of stupid things so um you know I I think that's the real story is that the foreign policy establishment these people that get on TV and claimed to be ... suddenly in Madison to everything and they just have a question All right now my\nGuest is Randall swell or he is editor in chief of security studies and has an essay in foreign policy foreign affairs magazine three cheers for Trump's foreign policy will be back in ten minutes\nTo", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Think", "city": "Austin", "day": "11"}
