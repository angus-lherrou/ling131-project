T. Andrew gram\nOf which is increasingly used to non invasive we\nUm you know look at the coronary arteries in that city Andrew damn showed that I had you know a a approach a fifty percent blockage is in uh the main coronary artery in thirty to fifty percent blockage is in the other two main coronary artery so\nUm so I definitely had the beginnings to sort of mid course of coronary disease and that was only forty five\nAnd um you know to say that that was a shock is an understatement a you know I had two small kids I'd spent my life\nOr treating heart disease and uh and then of course with my family history and you know the history of my paternal great\nFather like didn't mentioned in my maternal grandfather also died suddenly of a heart attack and eventually my mother died of a heart attack so all this was sort of swirling through my head and and uh it was one of the motivations for writing this book\nDid that challenge your sense that maybe by being a heart expert you've had some control over over the health of your own heart\n\nYou know one would like to think one had agency over over one's life [laughter] uh and uh but that's not always the case I mean I was doing a lot of things I think a write honestly uh I was\n... you know eating pretty helpfully um I was exercising but the one area that I had a neglected I Would say is\nMy emotional life and\n[noise] you know it's increasingly clear that uh this is one of the themes of the book is that our metaphorical hearts in other words the heart that did was thought to house emotions house or emotional lives\nThat heart um that the natural philosophers focused on a intersects with the biological heart that I and other\nHeart doctors as well as scientists through the twentieth century focused on and and and uh innovated or in other words\nThe heart is not just about mechanical pump it is a pump as exceedingly sensitive to our emotions and so in a sense\nA even though the heart may not contain the emotions are emotional lives do very much affect our hearts and\nOne of my focus is over the last few years has been to really ... uh nourish my my emotional life a lot more than I had been I'd ... basically I think been collecting it somewhat in the\nIn the course of focusing on like you know career and work and so on\nThis this think I'm Chris Boyd [noise] did you ever\nFind yourself in the early days of your diagnosis with heart disease comparing your own health with that of your patients your cardiac patients\n\nMaybe to some degree a\nYou know I mean most of my patients\nFrankly had a much more severe heart disease than than I did I really had you know at least on the spectrum of things the beginnings of coronary disease has a heart failure specialist I Know exactly where\nThat road goes and it's a road that you know that uh I don't want to travel and I don't want my patients to travel or so in a sense you know I did\nUm compare but um I think more to the point I I\nI think identified with my patients more than I had a you know I I've probably ordered\nA a bunch of cat scans um you know without really giving it a second thought\nUm you know all over the course of my career patient had chest pain and and uh I think they would benefit from a stress test I might have order a C. T. Andrew gram but when I had it and when those results came in\nA it really it open my eyes to know how patients think and feel and how vulnerable they feel about their own hearts and I think that was probably the most eye opening thing\nSo people have probably always associated the heart with with this kind of life force right recognize that it's important for a beating heart for a person to be alive [laughter] but um it took a really long time to figure out what the heart actually dead can you talk about what the ancient Romans imagine the heart did for us\nI mean there there\nIs some relatively sophisticated scientific thinking I'm In the ancient Egyptians in some schools that suggests the heart does a circulate some sort of life spirit um but the Greeks know Romans for the most part really focused on the heart as a century\nUm in other words at a as a warning system or that things might be amiss\nAnd in a sense there's some accuracy there because our hearts do start beating faster when we are I'm In the presence of danger or our autonomic nervous system to feed into our heart\nI'm In a heartbeat and and cause I'm you know rapid heartbeat increase blood pressure and and and other things\nSo but the the focus really was\nOn the heart as the seat of the soul and uh the repository of the emotions are and it really wasn't until\nThe um the renaissance so maybe two thousand years after the Romans that we really came to a sense of the heart and what it actually did as the circular leader of blood [noise]\nMy guest is Dr Sunday ... he's a cop cardiologist and writer and director of the heart failure program at Long Island Jewish medical center of his book is called hearts history will resume the conversation and two minutes and you can join us by calling one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to [noise] um\nShowers and thunderstorms throughout the area this afternoon some of those thunder storms may be severe vocally heavy rainfall is possible early this afternoon as well we do expect ties in the lower eighties wins from the south of ten to Fifteen miles an hour it's pretty dark out there right now eighty degrees\nThe the uh sack around the heart cause a pair of cardio membrane had been torn because of this um stab\nThe step to stab wound and um and without thinking too much because he didn't really have any time he suited shot closed a it was the world's first documented a surgery and a heart surgery\nProbably now we know that a couple of other surgeries on the pair of cardio membrane had been formed but they hadn't been documented in and Williams almost certainly didn't know about them and those patients very likely succumbed but this patient survived he actually outlived Williams\n[laughter] uh and um he was discharged from the hospital and apart from getting in a few more ... he he lived to a normal life normal lifespan and so it's just incredible to me in the course of researching this book that um that you know the the world's first documented a\nYou know heart surgery was performed\nBy a black physician\nIn the era of Jim Crow uh it's it's it's absolutely amazing to me um and uh uh his his accomplishment is just something to be you know celebrated um you know in in part because of a you know what he must have [noise]\nUh you know the obstacles he must have overcome to to get to that person", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Think", "city": "Austin", "day": "09"}
