I'm ... I'm Rebecca\n... and this is key that's on your head today gap I think\nA lot of what we\nBelieve in ... about the world is is not information that we get from our own sense is\nCertainly we we get a lot of information from our senses but a lot of what we believe comes from other people and and as a result of that we have to find ways to decide what information should we believe that we're getting from the people around us\nAnd one of the things that might influence whether we choose to believe something is if either a person and authority is saying something frequently\nOr if lots of people are saying something then that feels like something that must have some truth to it ... regardless of what the actual facts on the ground\nYeah and and I we we forget how susceptible we are\nTo being influenced in our thinking by things that we don't think are influencing or think I mean there's are saying we we trust our perceptual systems to tell us what's going on in the world\nAnd yet because as artist saying often were social species and so we interact with other people whose opinions influenced our own opinions\nThe same thing actually holds true not just for things that we would call opinions but the things that we would call back mhm yeah and that's really where this is crucial so the example that Bob was giving is is an important one because\nThere's there's a fact of the matter here I mean you you could find lots of ways to independently verify which line is longer and your your visual system actually generally speaking does a pretty good job of figuring out which line is longer\nAnd yet despite what you're seeing you will actually begin to state and and potentially even believe that that\nYour visual system is is giving you the wrong information just because of the social\nConsensus that formed on the other side that's actually a fairly common aspect of human psychology because we have to determine what to believe from the people around us that the concept of gas lighting is is essentially a deliberate use\nOf a strategy that takes into account the fact that uh the social environment has a big influence on what\nPeople believe but a point that are making this really important to emphasize and this is how verbal rehearsal changes belief I mean not just what you say out loud changes the way other people think what you believe\nBut saying things yourself river Herschel really changes what you come to believe is true and when you're in an environment where are the people around you the public media all kinds of sources of information are professing a certain a view of the world\nAnd now that's in your memory and we every time you call it a mind that's another reversal calling to mind that actually becomes more and more true but often you know ... ... when we're trying to um make our own decisions about something whatever happens to be\nWe we we tend to decide who among all the sources of information either people or organizations or media streams or whatever\nWho who should I be trusting and the most that if there are things that differ and things that are that are in in in disagreement who I'm going to put more credibility that they don't want to say too about you know what you're saying about this can actually be a good thing\nIs it almost all aspects of human functioning\nCan be co opted priests of ill intense but actually the same mechanisms are being used in\nThose things about organizations who are trying to say something repeatedly so it actually becomes the fact of the matter is our earlier now not only\nCan can these mechanisms ... co opted for nefarious purposes society but but the same mechanisms can also\nPlay a role in just one on one interactions in which you you may actually changed the way\nThat you interpret something that happened in your life on the basis of things that another significant person in your life says and if that individual has an ulterior motive\nTo get you to believe something that is more favorable for them and less favorable for you even in very significant circumstances\nThis can actually then cause you to question your entire view of of reality inside of of that interpersonal relations and this is particularly dangerous in situations in which something that's happened to someone a in a relationship\nIs something that they might actually be a afraid of or shame to or not actually want to talk to lots of people about because in those situations are the conversations that you end up having are often had with a single individual yeah\nAnd and hey\nWhen when you when you may have something that's happened to you that that feels shameful\nThen you'd actually like to believe that it didn't happen right so there's some motivated reasoning to want to to go along with someone who said oh no no you have a ... you've completely misunderstood the situation\nBut on top of that you can't engage in any of the other behaviors you wouldn't normally engage in to try to check your interpretation of us\nJewish so often if you're confused about something you consult another authority or another individual\nSo you know if you can't decide which actor was in a particular movie which is there's no shame in that then you talk about it for a while and no matter how confident everybody is then you go to IMDB and you'll look it up yeah\nBut when a and and and similarly you know if if you're confused about about some something that somebody else going on in the world or even some event in your life\nYou can you you might just reach out to a bunch of friends and say well so you know here's here's what happened what do you think and and in those circumstances your friends will give you a different opinion or their own opinion which may or may not accord with what you heard from someone else and that gives you perspective\nBut if you're willing and able um or or or ashamed to talk about something with anyone else now the single individual you may be talking to has a profound influence over the set of beliefs that\nYou end up next week we'll talk about scooter culture with Dr art management and Dr ...

I Am my grandparents his grandchild so I'm I tried to be as respectful as possible of of my elders and so in most respects the way I can I said to him you know sir [noise]\nWe are here because you were there [laughter]\nTry and write the Spanish American war when the when the Americans took over the Philippines I I I realize a few years ago that the poem white man's burden ... right which is the first time I read that homeless because some James Baldwin it's um it was an ... grass to the fire next time\nBut that poem the subtitle white man's burden is the United states in the Philippine Islands\nRub your ... wrote a poem to help persuade the American government to take over the Philippines which was the first time to this country you know um exercise its imperial life sentences\nYet and we were just talking about that on on the show yesterday in a different program the U.S really does not acknowledge its history has a ...\n[noise] you know when I was a kid Gore Vidal's so it's just fascinating to me because I didn't know what the hell he was talking about what I Would read those essays and those books but one thing that's up very early\nOn was he said that you know we live in the United states but ... ...\nThat that that we live in a country that doesn't know and doesn't want to know the full force of its history and I would actually argue\nThat the Trump presidency is the cost of that it's the cost of not knowing and not wanting to know\nAnd when it comes to this issue you know ... ... you're ... you're in Texas I was just in Houston a few days ago for my book tour um Texas is home to one point eight million undocumented immigrants that we know of\nOne point eight million right [noise]\nAnd I did a book event and you know many people that came come from what's called mixed status families meaning the parents are undocumented but the kids are U.S born citizens right well mixed up\nAnd it was just interesting thinking about do people in Texas understand\n'em that people here come you know immigrants come to this country illegally are not legally right um because of what the United States foreign policy and economic policies have done in effect\nIn countries like Mexico and places like Central America or we can actually be stocks are we asking these harder questions\nAs someone who is undocumented do you think undocumented people do or do not benefit from that kind of collective amnesia because on the one hand um you know lots of people don't want to let you forget that\nDon't have the the magical breathes hard right that would allow you to to remain here legally on the other hand as you point out throughout the book there has always been people who who knew the truth of your status and wanted to help you and and the reality is just about every undocumented person is in a similar situation\nOr you know I I structured the book 'cause you know lying passing in hiding yeah right so do I find that I was here illegally when I was sixteen I'm thirty seven now and I could argue that the past twenty five years have been about lying about who I Am trying to pass to someone else and hiding\nRight but I could not have survived in this country and succeeded in any way that I have succeeded without people helping lie pass and hide with me\nRight um and and that's the way in the book I made a very conscious effort to talk about all those a lot of um educators a lot of um teachers right who didn't know what the DREAM Act because there was no direct who didn't know that in this country there is no process for someone like me\nTo quote unquote legalized myself right like there's this myth out there that people like me she just get on the line somewhere and all of a sudden will be us citizens taking your welfare that's just not true and yet we've elected a president because of that lie [noise] right [noise]\nSo for me the fact that you know some people call them I was just with an undocumented young men yesterday and he calls them\nHis guardian angels [laughter] I called them the good Samaritans right 'cause I was raised Catholic and so\nThese people of all races and backgrounds even when I was in Houston last week right there was a black woman who brought this young um I think what a mall in undocumented students she's been mentoring for years and she was like I was ready to adopt him outside to do everything but I couldn't figure it out\nRight and when it comes to this conversation do whenever we talk about undocumented people in Texas are we talking about those good Samaritans and those guardian angels when are they in this conversation\n... think I'm ... [noise] so it's\nIt would be hard to overestimate the effect it had on you when you realize that you were undocumented you um as you describe in the book you wanted to start driving like every teenager you snuck your green card at their grandfathers filing cabinet went to apply for a learners permit\nWhat happened when you got to the DMZ [noise]\nWell I didn't think anything that I thought I'd show my green card and I show my Mountain View highschool ID and you know I was listening to a lot more set and Bush to men in my walkman today and I get out done so seriously that's but that's what I thought [laughter]\nAnd then the woman's a DMV when she looked at my green card she flip the twice maybe less than ten seconds and she lowered herself into boos and she looked at me and said this is fake\nDon't come back here again [laughter]\nSo in many ways she was actually the very first person to like save me right because she could've reported me she said don't come back here again but here's the thing the moment she said that I immediately deep in my mind that that first came to my mind was I'm not Mexican\nOh so you're going to be documented right yeah\nBecause in this country at sixteen years old in Nineteen Ninety seven whenever the newspaper or the radio show or the television news said anything about anyone who has speak papers or someone who's you illegally it was always what Mexican people\nAnd because my name is will say I thought maybe she thought it was Mexican so isn't that horrible that I actually took that into my belief that\nYou know I'm saying this you now you know your your listeners are in Texas um\nI think we owe the Mexican people in this country a tremendous apology how we have completely racial ISIS issue and pointed our fingers by the way what thirty three million Mexicans in the United states many of them will be here before there was the United states of America\nAnd yet this issue has been synonymous with them\nAnd I wonder what happens when you're young Mexican kid in any classroom in America especially in a state like Texas and you have a teacher or you have a classmate and they talk about what about illegal people model of a sudden you start thinking that they're talking about you\nHow horrible is that and\nIn fact you know that that today the largest growing fastest growing group of undocumented people in this country are Asian people\nAre from Asia young Koreans Indians Chinese Filipinos and yet you know\nAs you know in the book there's a whole chapter called the master narrative yeah\nWhich I wrote kind of um as as as a way of hours away of gratitude to Toni Morrison who\nHas significantly impacted the way I think of this country the way I think about myself but the master narrative of immigration in this country specifically illegal immigration is all wrong and we and the news media ... specifically have a really big role to play as to why it's wrong\n[noise] my guest is journalist so San Antonio Vargas he is founder and CEO of the nonprofit define American and author of the memoir deer America notes of an undocumented citizen if you'd like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to\nYou can email think at the R. A. dot org or find this on Twitter We're AT T E R a think\nOn K U T Ninety point they\nLive from here with Christie ... comes up live from San Francisco tomorrow five K. U. T. Lindsay Buckingham parade for the riff raff Gaby Moreno and comedian Aaron fully\nJoined Chris for the show don't miss it tomorrow evening at five live from hardly\nIn order to avoid it as they are as it happened [noise]\nThat is a wonderful question um well before I answer that I should say that there are organizations like you know I'm an Asian advance Asian American the dancing for justice ... there's a group called Eighteen million racing does there's Eighteen million Asian Americans in this country\nThere are groups there are a PI Asian groups that are vocal but not nearly enough\nYou know in in a dollar because I say in the book to be here illegally it's called the empty ... which translates to hiding in hiding right\nAnd in many ways I Would argue that the Asian community at large hasn't really kind of stepped up to this moment and I've been asking myself that question for the past seven years I certainly been asking myself that question\nIs just drunk elected president and again there are exceptions is not an over generalization but given the fact that Asian immigrants are now the fastest growing immigrant group and the fastest growing racial group\nUm we have been relatively you know um we had been relatively not as active as other people I Wonder if because if it has to do with actual collective mess right I mean if if you think about it Guatemalans Hondurans Salvadorans Mexicans Venezuelans have a shared language right\nAnd for many many years now that is shared issue immigration um if you think about it like what do Koreans Chinese Vietnamese Filipinos in the Indians have in common\nIt's almost like we've constructed this Asian identity right when in reality culturally ethnically those groups you know I'm very little in common outside of noodles rice\nSo it's an even bigger struggle to collect dumped together although I Would argue that the moment where we are now you know like\nWater Asian groups regardless of ethnicity what what are we all doing together so we could have a bigger voice and take bigger space in an issue that we should own\nLike right now with what the Trump Administration is trying to do it would significantly impact Asian family in this country because many Asian people are here because of like my grandparents because of the family base the family unification part of the immigration nationality act if you did away with that\nThen what happens right\nMike asked is a San Antonio Vargas we're talking about his memoir deer America notes an undocumented citizen you're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd\n[noise] okay I'll say I I I Want to express deep respect for the people who who immigrate to this country and have more humble jobs to people who pick our food and clean or building our care for elderly absolutely so I when I Want to stipulate that that's the kind of work my ancestors did when they arrived here\nUm but but you are the kind of immigrant that people look at and and and say well there should be a path for a guy like him how many how many immigration lawyers would you estimate that you've talked to over the years to try and figure out if there would be a way for you\nOh at least [noise]\nAt least probably thirty five so let me explain there there are four ways that I could legalize my status and have some sort of way one asked the president for part and\nThat's not happening I'm not doing that too I'm asked a Congress member of a center or a senator of the state that I grew up in which is California to introduce a private bill on my behalf so to basically introduced a bill to make me\nA U.S citizen but just me for the private though I Can't do that if I wanted to do that I could have been seven years ago when I first you know just close my status but then that would just perpetuate this idea that I Am more worthy than other people because of my resume\nAnd I don't think that's I don't think that's right and if I were to do that I'd rather leave the country to do to\nWrite the third option is if we pass immigration reform and we will people like me will be granted immunity people like me meaning people who have actually committed fraud right to sue to get all the jobs that I got\nI check the U. S. citizen box and unemployment forms which is something that by lawyers probably don't want me talking to you about right now [laughter]\nBut if we're going to tell the truth about the issue I have to be honest about that I live in the government forms I broke the law when I was Nineteen years old when I first did it knowingly and I remember looking at the forum and it said perjury on it if you lie you know I didn't have an iPhone I couldn't just like Google perjury but I knew that it was bad but I checked the box I wanted to work\nI Want it to pay taxes which we do I wanted to make sure that I could make a living for myself right [noise]\nSo that's the third option to fourth option which is not an option in many ways but it is a choice which is to leave I can just leave\nAnd I actually think this is a really important points you make so as I mentioned one point eight million undocumented people in the state of Texas millions more if you count the u._s. citizens that live within documented people\nIs an incredible that every day we're still get up to go to work driving places we're not supposed to drive and dropped gets off to school right and provide for our families is not a miracle that even at a time like this when the president talked about us like we're in the back office box\nRight that we still get on every day [noise] see I find that I find that miraculous and I would argue that that's the miracle of what America does to you it dares you write and America is like one big dare\n\nYou told a friend that you didn't meet the kind of white people who would put you in your place until you moved to Washington DC and there's just so much wrapped up in that statement\nI'm a ... a lot of what was\nDifferent in DC and did it take you by surprise like oh there are lots of white people who are just going to dislike me because I'm a ...\nI've heard it was you know it's so interesting because like you know I grew up in Mountain View California right like we're we're Google and Silicon Valley is and whenever when I got older whenever like you know for example my first film premiered at the Tribeca Film festival in two thousand times before I came out as an documented\nAnd into film festival my high school principal my superintendent the principles I'm second like everyone from my high school came to the film festival and my friends were like\nWho are all those white people [laughter] and I'm like well during my high school family you know when they flew all the way from California to New York just to be with me and my friends were always shocks especially my parents were people of color always shocked like\nYou were race you are like mentored by those people and I guess I was but when I was growing up it was [noise]\nThey didn't see me as someone to be said I wasn't someone to be condescending to I wasn't someone to be explained I wasn't a problem to them you know I was just a kid that they just wanted to help out there was something incredibly just\nPure about that and you know I didn't know any better so I didn't know I didn't I didn't even really know that they were white I mean some people the white I mean yeah Julie Roberts as white you know of Donald Trump's White yeah there's that but for me it's more about how people make you feel\nSo it wasn't until we moved to DC surrounded by a bunch of white people condescend to ... and ... many of whom doubted why are you in this room [laughter]\nHow did you get this job oh you you went to the school\n[laughter] lots of advice for the Washington\nPost you I mean you could swing you're you're a person I had somebody who went to an Ivy League school no fest Ivy League schools are wonderful right but I didn't go to one and so people wonder like why how did this to get easier\nAnd more often than not there were there were white and so I was like um I got here the same way you got here [noise]\nMy guess is journalist has San Antonio I guess we're talking about his memoir deer America note seven undocumented citizen and if you'd like to be part of the conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to a friend who's on Twitter We're AT T E R a thing\nAnd you're listening to Iran came to the point by joining us this afternoon when for giving me much\nMore comes from Boston found\nSociety showing this week at a if as cinema the new documentary 'cause some of the insanity plus twentieth anniversary screenings of a cult classic buffalo sixty six and Japanese animation perfect blue more info at Austin film dot org", "show_name": "Think", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "05"}
