Canada recreational marijuana is legal Canada has become the second country in the world after ugly to make marijuana legal\nBut it's a far bigger country I'm rules on where to buy and consume dairy activists empower was among the first to purchase it legally at a store and St john's Newfoundland\nMix history like we just did it finally did it all the years of activism paid off in this thing goes for a minute walk every day to be back on the\nPeninsula Riggio is a reporter with the news agency Canadian Press and she's in Toronto so Paola some marijuana apparently is going to be framed on the wall others using it at Canada has had medical marijuana since two thousand one this is recreational across the country how's it going\nWell people have been waiting for this for for quite some time there's been quite a bit of activism\nAnd in fact our our federal government campaigned on this several years ago there's been people who as you heard when to buy a in various places at midnight but the problem is depending on where you are the rules are different as to where you can buy\nWhere you can consume so even though it's illegal across the country there are still things to be mindful of depending on where you are\nWell Canada has ten provinces three territories and as you said the rules very and are there you know cities or territories that are against this that are trying to maybe push back against it with their own restrictions\nThere are definitely some jurisdictions that are being more conservative with their rules provincially that's taken the former mainly of restricting where you can consume um there's some\nProvinces where you can only consume candidates in your own home for example um whereas a lot of others are making it kind of like smoking cigarettes where wherever smoking's legal then you can smoke marijuana um as long as you're not in your children or you know at the wheel of a car or something like that\nWhat we've yet to see is what municipalities will do because a in a lot of provinces municipalities are being given the power to enact even more stringent rules\nAnd that has yet to play out um I think we'll see that in the next few months or how various a local government supplies\nYou know he said that happened here in Colorado for instance there began to be concerned about how close a seller could be to school so I'm sure some of that's going to unfold that we understand that\nIn provinces without a regulated retail framework Canadians can purchase marijuana on line but has to be from a federally licensed producer and there has to be secure home delivery\nUm you have to be at least Eighteen and older in Canada to buy recreational marijuana starting today but some provinces have made the age Nineteen\nMhm so so Eighteen is the baseline that set out in the\nFederal law but provinces are given the power to you know raise that age if they want to and a lot of them have aligned it with a with their legal drinking age is a so in a lot of promises that's Nineteen or there's a few that have kept it at Eighteen so we're going to see a lot of those same variations that there are four consuming drinking alcohol\n... and how much can you buy it how much can you grow now that it's legal\nSo under the federal law um you can have up to a thirty grams of of dried candidates or equivalent in in non dried\nYou can grow up to a four plants per home for personal use 'em but again those are all things at least that the number of plants that can be restricted further by promises and there are a few that have said that you actually can't grow any for herself\nWas a huge difference in Canada is that this is a federal law and the government itself the government of Canada is going to oversee the production manufacturing so\nThe fact that the federal government is involved means that banks can be involved here in the United states it's the states that are allowing it one by one but the federal government still outlawed it so banking\nIs it because it's a big problem with what to do with the money that flows from it just doesn't seem like it's going to be a problem in Canada um there\nThere's a huge spotlight on the marijuana market in Canada there has been for quite some time it is looking like it's going to be big business um the stocks\nHave all been skyrocketing up until today\nUm today you know it's a bit of a shaky start and we don't really quite know how that's going to play out there's a lot of fears about um a a bubble of marijuana bubble because you know while there are estimates as to what the market is going to look like we actually don't really know what the demand is yet and so I think there's going to be quite a lot of attention on that are in a couple of months and years what\nAbout the black market is that going to cut into the now legal market\nThat was the idea behind legalization was to kind of stamp out the black market or at least\nFind a way to bring people who were selling marijuana into illegal markets ... framework um whether or not that will be completely eradicated from means to be seen and especially when there are\nKind of question marks as to the regulations and wear a stores and and just access to marijuana will\nBe um in Ontario I Know that there's a possibility for municipalities to refuse to had any kind of\nCanada stores on their property and there's been some concern that that could allow some pockets of the black market to still thrive in those areas\n[noise] [noise] well less not Americans don't get any ideas\nYou cannot bring it

about the government\nAnd Christie thought this was insane you thought he thought that basically in fact you look at president cities and you could trace back a lot of the problems that that occurred to to failures in the transition\nI mean it really is a critical moment in a weak moment and the government and it's and it's because the American government is that is so heavily a\nIt managed by political point is that it isn't just civil Chris civil servants continue to do whatever they do no matter who's in office\nIn any case ah ... the Christie so Christie managed to finagle a few million dollars of of Trump's campaign money over Trump's objections\nAh to create this effort and the day or two a day or two after the election Trump fired the whole operation he fired only Christie but the hundreds of people who were meant to be going into the\n... the various agencies to learn what was going on\nWhy did he find\nThat's a great question [laughter] the the ... because I think it's a I think there's a simple answer and if they ask for Chris Christie would give you is that\nNobody really expected to win a the ... they didn't have it they're not written and acceptance speech they had written a concession speech\nOr and so that that that's why he was allowed to do it in the first place because it was sort of it was sort of first show no one really imagined that all these people that Christie assembled we're actually going to be in the position of taking over the government\nAnd a Chris Christie a back in the days when he was a prosecutor had put Jared Kushner's father in jail for tax fraud\nAnd ah so pushing their Jared Kushner the president's son in law bore a grudge against Christie and and asked that a Christie be fired them and it became clear of course he was going to be a position of real authority\nThat's one answer that would be Christie's answer the this I think there's even more going on than that though because the in the process of vetting people for top jobs in the administration and making sure they didn't have\nYou been problematic resumes they didn't have problematic experiences they didn't have things that would it be embarrassing to come out in the confirmation hearing they rejected lots of people who are close to Trump and who wanted top jobs Michael Flynn chief among them\nWho became national security advisor and I think those ... people also agitated to get rid of this operation that had vetted them more left to the sidelines\nAnd then too I think you know the other reason is a Trump himself\nWas kind of dismissive about the whole thing I mean anybody who realize the scope of what he was about to have to manage would have been horrified at the prospect of not having qualified people to help them to do it\nBut he he had not even really imagine the job so the fact that he was so he is the big thing is his willingness to listen to other people telling him to do this because it that that's what's odd it's odd that he didn't see how important it was\nAnd you have as it resolves this kind of comedy that leads me into the story where you have a cross the federal government\nYou know in the department of agriculture and commerce and energy and transportation they know people have set up that I got in a conference Roman ... plates of finger sandwiches and the briefing books are out in parking spot to set aside for them waiting for the people that role in the day after election in ... now he's the one show that day\nNo one shows that week or the next week or the next and in in many cases I found myself\nReceiving briefings ah from people who had never given them\nI was the first person to hear the briefing and so that was that that is that was material\nSo just just to make sure that we put this in context a lot of the folks that you talked to who are um agency lifers you know people who have had long careers in these agencies they've been\nPossible transitions and to be clear this one is different from any transition that they have experienced before is that right\nNo one has seen anything like this yeah ah no one had seen the level of\nDisinterest and ... that it may be true that when Bush handed\nThe man is the government over to Obama\nAnd the way Bush did a a ... a really pressed Obama bombers really grateful for the care with which he handed the government or\nOr it may be that some of the briefings didn't get entirely read or not ... but but in general there were lots of meetings between the people who were leaving I knew knew what was going on and the people who are coming in who did and who didn't\n[noise] okay let's step back for a minute and just talk about federal agencies most of us as I'm sure you've discovered in your reporting must average Americans are able to kind of lightly ignore what they do for us but a big part of nearly every agencies existence\nIs planning for the future and and because the majority of those employees are not political appointees their thinking on a different timetable than politicians can you help us understand why that's so important\nSo have you back away from the federal government whatever you think of it or you know if I think we all agree it's got a basic responsibility to keep\nUs safe and the ... the\nThe kind of basket or portfolio risks it's keeping us safe from is it it's it's it's pretty breathtaking and complicated\nAnd the the ... we all have to pay some attention every now and then to the Treasury Department of the state department but there these other departments that that people pay very little attention to and their mission critical and they're thinking about things a\n... in the need to\nBe thought about so far let's take an example um the department of energy into which a Trump installed\nRick Perry former governor of Texas who had called for the elimination of the department of energy in a in a presidential debate I'm actually the one who left out right ... he said he wanted a lemonade three of the departments and he couldn't remember the names of one of them right at least one of them and energy was what he said he'd forgotten the name of\nWell well what does it do I'm One\nOf the things he does is it maintains the nuclear arsenal ah it it assembled and it tests nuclear weapons and make sure that these bombs do go off when they're not supposed to go off it may make it tries to make sure that I'm ... materials that might be used to make nuclear weapons don't get into the wrong hands\nUm this is a this is a complicated important job it it does\nAn awful lot of\nI mean if you of basic science research that made it primarily is basically one big science operation it funds and helps manage national that a great national laboratories that are national treasure Livermore and San Diego and Los Alamos and in these places um what happens is\nPhysicist sewer there because the government grass Earl naval laying them to explore all caught kinds of interesting questions or get interested by the by in in how to you know tested nuclear weapon without setting went off for example and they come to be collaborators in the process of maintaining this are so\nAh how it works is is kind of important\nAnd the uh uh [noise] if you had to kind of like extract one of the themes that runs through that whole department\nIs that a lot of what it's doing is on a very long time scale India is taking it taking in terms of this year or next year and the next year they're thinking in terms of the next generation\n... ... in the problems that they deal with and in the possibilities that explore so one problem the dark department of energy deals with is cleaning up nuclear waste their they it spends three billion dollars a year in eastern Washington\nTo clean up a the mess that was made\nBy the generation of plutonium for the atom bombs that we dropped on Japan it's a buy one conservative estimate a hundred billion dollar problem that will take a hundred years to solve that this stuff it was dumped into the soil and is it in in millions of gallons\nAnd his deep under the soil and his moving slowly towards the Columbia River and threatens to poison the Pacific northwest\nThat stuff doesn't just go away and they manage that it's a it's a ... and they manage it ... in conditions that are not really conducive to smart walked to a management very as a society that is funding it short term and paying very little attention to it and uh what kind of answers now um\nThey they\nFund the happy end of the department of energy they fund lots of research basic science research that industry is not\nA industry increasingly I mean but this is talk long been true but increasingly\n... you know will fund research that will pay off in five or ten years not research that pays off in twenty or Thirty years and so so that this the solar power energy fracking Tesla all you can trace back to the department of energy either kind of venture capital a grants or or or low\nMy guest is Michael Lewis he's a journalist whose new book is called the ... risk will come back to the conversation in two minutes and You're welcome to join us my calling one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to\n... [noise]\nThis is the question that I asked myself over and over and over if I Am Rick Perry\nAnd I have called for the elimination of a department whose whose actual inner workings I have no idea of I don't even know that they take care of the nuclear arsenal including when he found a hazing because it was kind of amazing because nuclear weapons are assembled in the Texas Panhandle so you would have thought the governor of Texas we know that but never mind that\nUm that that I my response would be you know ... why are you asking me they don't ask me get someone who knows this stuff to do it and over and over people say yeah I'll do it and I think the thing I think what was that what happened was\nA couple of things one is virtually everybody who had any kind of knowledge of how of what was going on inside the various departments the federal government\nWas ... was at least vaguely hostile it from Republicans and Democrats so they're all a lot of the former Bush people who were very knowledgeable how the government ran a we're already wiped out from consideration for the jobs because Trump demanded that everybody be loyal to him and they have demonstrated loyalty\nSo it left a pool of people is it did not include a lot of qualified people so you might ... that that may be one reason someone who didn't know anything rationalize and no one else will take the job\nAnd the second thing is I think that we've got to the point\nWhere there are a lot of people who are politicians who who who\nWho don't actually respect government if they don't actually realize how hard it is to govern and how important the federal government is and so they think oh I can do this with my left hand it's a and if a stepping stone to a bigger and better job or a lobbying job or what not\nAnd that's the thing that happened is that when you when you eliminate the mission driven side of things when you eliminate when you know on are attracting people say to the national weather service whoever ... have a lifelong passion for weather prediction\nWhen you're just saying I'm you know anybody any old Trump loyalists will do just as long as they're really loyal\nWhat happens is is you attract people who are money driven who who are is air for some very narrow financial purpose and so they're they're because they're there because ah\nThey want to get rid of the climate change data from the Web sites and the department of agriculture and the department of energy and worked for they worked right which 'cause they work for a fossil fuels company where they want to lobby for fossil fuels industry or or their the lobbyist for the ... the soft drinks companies this happened in the department of agriculture\nA ... you know who who want to get Pepsi back on the school lunch menu a because it would cause the agriculture department decides what what's acceptable except to acceptable nutrition\nIn in schools I'm so that kind of thing happens or that you have people they have a purpose but it's their own narrow purpose rather than the larger public purpose\n[laughter] and I guess I\nThink there may be people listening Michael who are saying well maybe the people at the very top don't matter maybe it really is sort of lifelong bureaucrats that keep these agencies running I mean to what extent is that true and to what extent does it matter who's in the top job\nYou know it's funny the very people who might say that are people who have been nothing but abusive towards those bureaucrats for the last four years you know if they if if it were ... that there regard them as the deep state you can't hold both positions\nAt once if they're the ones who were actually just running thing and it doesn't matter who the four thousand people who are actually writing the government are\nSo first is not true if you if you it may be true for a very short term effect right now uh I mean one of the reasons not more bad things have happened in the federal government is this true civil servants the permanent civil service can step in and and and occupy jobs for a while but they don't have positive\nThey don't have that they need positive direction they don't have the authority to move to move in one direction or another without without the political appointees telling them what to do so that it's pretty it's a pretty dysfunctional way of of of running the government but the second thing is\nUm the Trump Administration came in with over hostility to those very people and to the extent they went in they went and did did things like\nAt the department of energy demand a list of names of all department of energy employees who attended a climate change meeting a so they might be isolated and punished or you know or removed to a foreign posting Alaska a it is I'm ... and and not surprisingly\nAbout twenty percent of the top six thousand career\nSenior a civil service executives are left in the first year of the Trump Administration so we ... they were they've been gutting the the actual permanent civil service at the same time and and not surprisingly demoralized\nSo I think that it might be nice actually if we change the structure\nOf our government so it was less dependent on the political people more like the u._k. government or the European governments where you've had this permanent civil service that basically ran the whole operation no matter who was the president but we don't have that\nHave a we ... we have a government is heavily dependent on the people who get put in by the president\nDoes stink on ... ... let's go to the phones now we have Larry on the line in Houston Hi Larry\nHello go right ahead please high there either I\nLike all the the question I have is is if it were talking about uh the the racial that\nThat the uh uh that we we gave out very well part of it was back back to the fifties or we had a surplus of food\nAnd the race but coach Arlen was was is that for having food stamps because we gave away surplus cheese at a flower and it was all given ally or as a way\nTo reach ... food that's that's\nA crisis of it yeah that's why they changed a lot of things for our ... our wedding that without a therapy or I\nWant to know about that Michael\nWell it's ... he he I think he's right about that ... the ... the origin story the origin stories of these departments are very interesting I mean if the Justice Department was created in the first place as a\nAs a as muscle against ... to ... to have available against the Ku Klux Klan um the the energy the the Commerce Department um I mean\nThe Commerce Department is misnamed the Commerce Department is the ah is actually the department of data it it would it really does is accumulate lots of data about the society the census economic statistics and all the weather data is there the national weather services inside the\nCommerce Department three quarters of the budget is an accomplishment was essentially in ... in an environmental operation\nAnd the reason is there is that Nixon or when they were assembling all that the environmental operations underneath this agency called no uh uh uh this was furious with his Interior Department secretary who who ah would naturally host such a thing and so he just shoved it\nIn the Commerce Department I mean the the the there is up there they're why they start where they start is a\nIs interesting in the history of federal programs but now that it's humid doesn't know any advertising agriculture department doesn't much matter where it is the food stamp program is an extremely important program I mean a huge number of Americans depending on it for basic basic nutrition it's it gets this\nThat anybody who runs it responsibly will tell you this the problem with it is not that it's abused that it's under used that that there is some fraud and waste but it's pretty trivial\nOr the problem is that the actual benefits get distributed the state level and there are states that are hostile to the idea of feeding hungry people and then make it hard for the benefits they get to the people who need them\nI said what you need and the job wherever it is happens to be in the department of agriculture is someone who has a gift for cutting through red tape at the state level and persuading people at the state level to get these benefits to people who need them\n[noise] um\nI Want to get into the story or maybe we can call it the saga of of Barry Myers um first of all tell us his previous gag and then we'll take a break and then we'll get into a lot to do what he's doing all\nRight so Barry Myers what was the c._e._o. of accuweather accuweather is one of the private whether companies have began really as a just a wait a minute wait a minute if money was distributing National Weather service forecast newspapers but but has mushroomed into something more than that and and Trump\nHas appointed him to be head of NOAA the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in which sets the national weather service\nAll right that that's a good information hang onto it will take a quick break now my guest is Michael Lewis he's a journalist who read books including Moneyball liars poker\nAnd the big short the new one about the transition at federal agencies between the bomb and the Trump Administration is called the risk if you'd like to
