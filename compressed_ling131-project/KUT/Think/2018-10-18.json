relationship comes in we went to his shoulders awful to three nor laws\nThe ... summit in Brussels today also there NPR Berlin correspondent psoriasis hardy Nelson ... first of all start for those who haven't been following this as it heats up with this issue with the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland no hard border as trees and missing\nBut with ... you know when that goes through there would have to be one\nWell that's what both sides of the you included want to avoid um there are several reasons for that\nUh one is that there was a peace deal are the main one perhaps is that there is of a peace deal that's rather fragile still in Northern Ireland\nSo by having a border you end up creating friction that could have that deal blow apart so both sides actually don't want a hard border between the republic of Ireland which remains with the emu and Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k.\nAnd right now is just flew in place I mean you literally step from someone's backyard in someone else's backyard and there's a lot of commerce between the two\nAbsolutely that you are has the fact that this has been an open border is something that's it's promoted commerce it's promoted good relations and again it's kept the peace the issue is though if the u._k.\nSteps out of the a European Union as is the plan under breaks that there has to be a border somewhere and that's where they just can't agree on I mean the Europeans have taught or the email I should say has talked about\nDoing it in the Irish Sea the u._k. it's talked about maybe having some of their uh agencies and and and authorities handling the customs and the and the border controls and that's something that you doesn't want so there's just a lot of disagreement over exactly how to create a hard border but they do agree it shouldn't be between Northern Ireland and Ireland\nAnd and what about her sense that there's going to be an extension is everyone on board with that\nWell this is interesting because a little later today after a trees I made a statement Donald too is the president of the European Council a stood up and said let me just make it clear that the twenty seven other members did not want to talk about transition during a transition period or extending the transition period during the meeting on brags that\nAnd the implication from from a Theresa May was more that this was a proposal that have been floated a and not just Theresa May others have sort of mentioned that this was a European proposals there was some confusion about who is promoting that's\nA but what's clear is that Mr just has said that they would be amenable to extending it but this is not something under consideration right now they actually need to come up with a deal\nWhereas Theresa May she doesn't even like to call it a transition period she calls it an implementation period says that it's an idea that's been floated that is something that could be considered if I should say eases the debate over the board at the heart border issue with between Northern Ireland in Ireland\nI heard you say something earlier today on MORNING edition I just got a bit of it so I don't want to paraphrase I'd like you said there was this sense that some of the other attendees at this meeting or off you know having a snack sort of sending a signal that they weren't taking things so seriously what what was going on\nWell some it had been portrayed last month by Donald ... a ...\nIn Salzburg they were having a form of some of the this summit this week here in Brussels was a make or break of a deal for ... and then this week it's like okay we don't have an agreement\nNot as critical as we thought we still have time all the things that were they were saying last month was we're not the case and so\nShe waiting that was the fact that\nThis dinner meeting at which the twenty seven members that will member states that will be remaining in the e their leaders had a dinner meeting and then right afterwards a four of the members and this would be Germany luck some bird Belgium in France their leaders\nWent out for French fries and beer here in Brussels to really accentuate the fact that no one seems to be that alarmed about the fact that there isn't a deal\nYeah look you're based in Berlin Chancellor Angela Merkel just suffered another election step back last weekend when her position on Brexit and how is this affecting her political strength is kind of the ripple effect of it\nShe's toned down her harshness I mean she still is adamant that there has to be a deal because the latest estimates show uh that Germany could lose upwards of a hundred and ten billion dollars if brags that goes through without some sort of deal so there's a lot riding on this for\nFor Germany but she's also toned down I mean she doesn't want to make this I guess looking like yet another thing that she hasn't been able to handle a so she talked instead at this uh at the summit and she did not make many public statements but the one she made was that I have a a skill at or I always look at\nA creating a consensus and finding an agreement and that's what I'm going to focus on because I still think that we can do this\nOne thing I should mention there really is a sense among the remaining twenty seven members of the other I should say twenty seven members of the a block that the u._k. is basically on purpose delaying this in order to force concessions to put put the pressure to a point where there is no time left\nAnd he will have to have of course the u._k. sees it\nThe opposite way

[noise]\n\nI'm not on paper say in terms of federal policy but um in terms of how workplaces play out\nUm and so uh she ended up in a lot of retail jobs\nBut they still couldn't make ends meet and so we would end up just kinda like peddling things to people who had more money so we might be able to scrape together some extra change so every summer for example we were one of those\nFamilies that has a a tent on the two lane blacktop going through rural Kansas selling firecrackers to people from adjacent counties usually people from Wichita which is the most populous city in the state\nI'm On their way to the lake we'd catch 'em and sell them some fireworks make a little money that way so\nYou know it is a it's a creative life by necessity the it's almost an art form really um the clipping coupons um the strategizing of when to buy things the cheapest and and second hand and so on so so uh\nYeah ... clever folks I come from [laughter] why did she realized that you had grown up poor\n[noise] such a good question because I think it might be easy at first glance know knowing that I've written this book that\nI somehow had a sense of ourselves as quote unquote living in poverty as it was happening and by the way I say was as though it's a past tense ... the vast majority of my family is still very much living the experience that I tried to document in the book but time for me as a kid a you know\nIt was a ... the culture of the place with such that that one was um encouraged to never complain a and so I thought we've got enough food there is a roof over my head\nTherefore no complaints it was when ... even so as a kid I did understand that in I was always on the bottom rung of the kind of socioeconomic pecking order and are\nYou know the small ... Kansas towns where I went to school or whatever and but it was not it was never articulated you know there's I think sometimes to to survive economic struggle it requires on some level of a bit of denial\nUm just to get up every day and and and put one foot in front of the other and maybe that was at work in my family um and there's also a beauty I think into to acknowledging while they're poor and then there is poor and we aren't starving and so we're not I'm going to\nUm city ourselves but ah when I got to the University of Kansas as a first generation college student and who was you know working three set a time to pay the bills um I was on scholarship to cover my tuition which I had gotten by way of you know very strategically working hard as a high school students\nAll of that was going on for the first time for me in a place where I was rushing up against rubbing elbows with people for much more privileged backgrounds so you know it is the\nUniversity of Kansas is is a State University and to ... very elite um schools in say New England they might and uh\nBe surprised by this but there there's a lot of money going around those campuses and they're often there were kids who were from very Tony suburbs of Chicago who received nice new cars for high school graduation or um you know I was encouraged to I'm a\nPledge of sorority which I probably would not have made sense for my disposition anyway then if I'd want it even if I wanted to I couldn't have afforded it and I saw that you know when they told me how much it cost and\nUm and so that those years were for me when I was kind of waking up to um the economic divide in our country and for me you know to your earlier point about how we parse race and class I did find that there was at that moment in the late nineties when I got to a campus there was\nUm rightfully attention toward um uh assisting students of color and there'll be G. T. Q. community and historically disadvantaged groups but yet I\nAnd have a language for articulating what I was and that's a first generation college student from a low income household a who was white and no doubt doubt benefited from that in ways that I might never know but all the same I I did have a particular struggle that I'm kind of went unseen on campus and that was a it was a painful struggle sometimes\nDid you have to learn to Code Switch between I'm sort of the the way that your family communicated and the way that maybe the upper middle class students that you met at the University of Kansas communicated\nYes absolutely\nAnd um yeah I ... I think that we we don't often use that fairly I think contemporary term Code Switch in the context of class but but that is was certainly the case in it and still is for me I sometimes say I speak two versions of English country and fancy\nAnd I and I learned fancy in school and some and there's some spaces where that is the only language I bring forth but um but yeah it is a different a different way of communicating a different way of using English neither\nBetter nor worse but um\nOr just the the touchstones of of the culture are are different per class in place and uh and yeah I I at heck I'm Still\nI'm thirty eight and I'm Still kind of learning the ways that are not kind of like native to my behavior and my surroundings and uh when I'm In a very rarified place with you know decent people just like they are anywhere but there are different customs and expectations and in different environments that has everything to do with\nClass for sure [noise] I at least as far back as Charles Dickens we have had really sensitive narratives about um you know the humanity of people who happen to be poor and about the hard work they put in and how the system can be stacked against them that was England it happens in the United states as well why is there shame attached to poverty\n[noise] oh my gosh you know my best stab at that is that we have [laughter] you know well first of all we have that kind of and a national\nStory or or perhaps missed that you're talking about at the outset the American dream and that has something to do with um whatever work you put in you know you you report you so [noise]\nAnd um and and I think that if if that is kind of like the the default setting or like the deepest core of the story that we're telling ourselves as a country\nThere for you know there there would then be some suspicion that people who are not having good economic outcomes must therefore not be doing good hard work\nAnd so I think that the shaming of the poor in this country which I couldn't articulate when I was a kid but I definitely felt at on on a cellular level has to\nDo with that um assumption that ones um [noise] a wealth\nHas some sort of correlation with one's merit\nAnd you know it goes right down to our language and I I think that some of this is so um little examined that it might it might be a surprise some of your listeners to\nTo think about this that the when we say the poor with a poor people and that means that means I'm a lacking financial wealth\nPour is also the also means bad it had a I'm a single word that we used for something negative poor health poor test results poor\nUm air quality and so I I don't think that those sorts of tricks of of language or a coincidence we we we live in a society that is deeply suspicious of an off at contemptuous of people\nWho um who have not succeeded in the eye you know for lack of better words fight of um getting by and capitalism\nYou write really movingly here about the about the stress and the toll that poverty takes on bodies like if you're born poor there's a really good chance that your body will wear out early based on the kinds of jobs that are available to you\n[noise] absolutely the whole uh second chapter of my book actually which is called the body of a poor girl is about the um the the mark that that class and specifically than the the working class or working poor\nUm the mark that you were a class assignment leaves on your physical person and that might be all the way from what I I assume\nThis is also term in Texas here in Kansas we say farmers tan for you know the ... and ... the the women too you know are just brown from the middle of thereby stepped down in the neck up and under underneath that pale from their work outside and and um\nAnd that's a sort of benign example and the uh of harrowing and and downright I'm nearly fatal example would be my um my dad's taking a job when I was in second grade um a side job driving around basically spent chemical\nWaste to dispose of and he was um poisoned in the process and almost died just for his proximity to\nTo poisonous materials that people with more money wouldn't have to mess with so so yeah it's a it's a dangerous\nLife my guest is Sarah ... we're talking about her book heartland a memory of working hard and being broke and the richest country in the world you can join our conversation at one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think K. E. R. A. dot org will find this on Twitter AT T E R a think\n...\n[noise]\nAnd um and that's one of the you know the great tragedies of the economic system I think is that we're we have all of this ... potential in and hack probably creative genius and and um problem solving and\nI'm wonderful skill sets for people to offer and I'm In no\nWay to to have out no validation of or harnessing of\nThose gifts for society\nAll right let's go to the phones our number is one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to ... you can also email think K. E. R. A. dot org we have an on the line and Houston Hi Anne\nHi I'm Sarah I just wanted to point out that\nI I I think when you just talked about education that that's the real answer and that's where you're going to find the genius because I think in all societies you're always going to have your rich and your middle class and you're poor [noise]\nUm I mean in in the communist countries you you had the ... the leaders the party leaders they got the ... they got the best and they got everything so again I I really think you know that that what you're saying is it's human nature\nYou know to have the differentiation of people but the weight lift your cell phone is education\nWhat do you think about that Sarah [noise]\nI agree with you that if you just look at the um\nThe span of human history we as a species have this an unfortunate tendency to create power structures well we're not the only species that does so actually\nUm I I Do actually think that it is possible to achieve a more equitable economic system than we have\nA ... but as far as the world at school plays in that I'm I'm with you a hundred percent that it is essential that and and public school in particular is the flag that I waive because that's the only one that I was able to access being from a family that didn't have\nA money for private schools that had been desired\nAnd um and I do you know I ... and I did ... you know as as an says pull myself up in many ways however\nAlong the way there were teachers in public program than free school lunch I got a hot lunch um that you know heck that was taxpayer dime um but uh it made all the difference in the world to me and so I I always want to make sure that I'm\nBeing reverence to all of the the good people and and the public programs and the social investment in schools that allowed my you know if it hadn't been for that I could have had all the determination ... in the world\nAnd and still come up short and so it's a combination I think of pulling yourself up and in a society giving you something to hold onto\nThroughout the book you write here and there to an imaginary daughter thinking about what you would tell a daughter to do um you also explain that from a very early age sometimes felt like a mother even though you've never had children can you talk about the kind of responsibility you did feel for yourself and for your family\n[noise] [noise] sure and you know\nSo I've been on book tour for a few weeks and have been very humbled by the people from all different\nLife who come up and say I've our stories are different and yet they're the same and I think that a lot of people even though their life met at MIT look very different than mine um whatever their challenges where they had a sense as a child that they were somehow responsible to their family or\nUm uh and and you know that can happen in a middle class or upper upper class household certainly for me it it it did I think have something to do with poverty I was probably a kid who\nJust my disposition was such that I was very um you know I was always caring for the rent of whatever litter in on the farm or um I had you know what society would call a very innate\nUm sense of nurturing\nI'm In my being female that could be um you know I'm a by extension viewed as quote unquote maternal\nUm so so yeah as as a child and having such a a very young mother she was Seventeen when she got pregnant with me there were a lot of times on the way of growing up where I I felt like kind of I'm a mother to myself and I'm a beach my little brother and to my own mommy then [noise]\nAnd um and that was\nA you know in some ways kind of one at one of the sadness of of my upbringing\nUm but uh but it also equipped me for the the things ahead and and um you know I uh view most of the all really of the challenges of the life I write about in this book as um as alternately blessings that that sure came in handy when I wrote this book for people to connect with so\nThis is thank I'm crushed Boyd [noise] you think for a long time like without really I guess consciously going through it in your head you assume that you would get pregnant really young and and have a life very similar to what you saw a in your mother and your grandmother\nMhm yeah you know I had a sense that a very young age of that cycle so I was talking about I think we talked about how a fifth generation farm kid\nThat's my legacy on my dad's side the cycle that I was born into and my mom's side is teen pregnancy so according to my research\nThe best I can find along my direct maternal line I'm the first female in the history of my family to not have a baby as a teenager well now there are a lot of reasons for that and it involves culture and class and a\nAnd gender and and um it it's a complicated thing to parse but I did I did at least feel as a kid okay somehow this correlates with the outcomes for women in my family\nAnd I did since it as like okay this is um this is a heck of family tradition and I I had an understanding that I didn't want to repeat it\nAnd um you know I Want to pause and say it is not as though um to have a a child so young is necessarily negative or I'm I'm you know even\nRegrettable ultimately my all of my the women in my family of course love their children but I did know as a as a teenager and even before\nThat that um that I wanted to make sure that I found a a stable life for myself before I entered that fray as it would be mother and so um so yeah that was one of the important pieces of the the poverty cycle I think that I was just kind of hyper conscious of as a a female child\nWas that something you could articulate to your mother and grandmother or did it feel somehow like a rejection of of them that might have felt too personal to them ...\nWow that's an interesting question you know um\nMy family a lot of love and my family but it's also very stoic by you know rural German Catholics in Kansas and they are and um we ... the honestly would never even had that conversation which which to some families might sound absurd but there are a lot of things that were just felt and and and not yet not discussed\nA not a secretive family but just a ... of a place where her eye I gleaned and I think we all kind of understood you don't talk about yourself\nAnd and are certainly your feelings goodness and so I I think that that I carried that is a very solitary internal pray that experience\nBut nonetheless you know that's definitely a a mission statement that that my mother and grandmother would have entirely been supportive you know I I guess I Do remember and I and I write about in the book some once in a while there would be a passing comment when I was a teenager like\nDon't wind up pregnant you know and and that would come from women usually in what they were saying to me was that will that will potentially limit you and we and um [noise] so it wasn't so much of a conversation about the private experience as much as just a very raw reality of it\nYeah All right let's go back to the phones we had sat on the line in Austin Hi Seth\nHi I go right ahead\nBy driving me around on your program and of course I prefer a wild remark made poverty [noise] your luggage from from the whatever national board the comic struggle for people in different countries around the corner of yoga\nI'm coming out of it depends a lot on the front opportunities but these are sort of you've ever been promoted by government or other social programs but mark and work on your and your experience but what was your work or the drawl if you bring out different countries there are programs that\nAre more outlook that our country and how that could really relate to the economics of the country\nStuff that's a really interesting question we have to take a break now so we will have a Sarah respond in just a moment my guest is Sarah ... she's a journalist who covers socioeconomic class public policy and politics\nAnd she's the author of a new book called heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country in the world will be back to the
