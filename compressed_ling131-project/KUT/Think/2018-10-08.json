attitudes about as long as anyone he's Ninety six years old within forty five years ago he created some of the most iconic sitcoms and American TV history all in the family the Jeffersons one day at a time and not\nAt one time he had nine programs on the air they were funny and they were powerful take all in the family\nWhy\nThe man of the house was Archie Bunker liked as easy chair and his home in Queens he liked the cigar\nAnd white people he didn't like blacks are jobs as he called them and certainly not gay people so he wasn't happy when his son in law Mike once invited a friend over to the house for lunch\nJust because a guy is sensitive ... and he's in intellectually wears glasses you make them adequately I never said a guy who wears glasses or quit a guy who wears glasses or for a guy who's a faggot equate navigated\nThe tough terrain of making Americans laugh at the show and squirm at the same time\nThe programs dealt with Americans divided attitudes about race and religion gender immigration and war we spoke team in Boston last week he said the cost to conversations in his shows were inspired by the typical talk at home when he was growing up\nOh yeah my family lived at the end of their nerves and the top of their long about anything what\nCourage is coming she didn't come to the wedding twenty two years ago and now she's coming that was my life over a period but something every political also but it was largely in the small fish area [laughter]\nWhen a when you dealt so openly through Archie Bunker and all the family with racism I mean there's a racist audiences coming from human every program obviously you trusted that the audience would get that that the audience would react\nAppropriately I have no doubt they forget how did you know that that was a very volatile time\nBecause what you could hear in the schoolyard was every bit is rougher tougher unusual daily and we did was no drop\nHer refer or or less ordinary then there are more and every\nOne of the issues that is a consuming many Americans right now is the issue of sexual assault\nAnd not just because of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings but also because of the me too movement you tackled this head on quite strikingly you and and the writers for all in the family there was an episode in I think it was Nineteen Seventy three whereas the daughter in all in the family played by Sally Struthers\nWas assaulted I waste of time\nYou see what he what he well he\nPut guys or something else [laughter] [laughter]\nThat's all right let's\nBring in another episode leader a link the episode gene Stapleton herself was assaulted in their home and the family home\nThat really and heard about this connects with what is going on today we had the episode in which he was the attempted rape took place in her escape from it and everything else the audience went wild that are trying to show that show\nThe reaction was so strong leader told us that he and his show's producers felt compelled to do a follow up program\nThe reactions of others especially males to a woman who'd been in that situation it was like they felt she was dirty\nArchery as to get over feeling that his wife had been with another man\nYou've dealt with it with the scene where Archie at one point hugs eat is to say\nIf things are okay I Love you I respect you still that was a live audience that was responding which was a first for the time\nBut you would the writers mixed some comedic lines in there like I'm the person who is assaulting eat it says you smell good and she says it's lemon pledge\nI mean it's a comedy show so that's why there's comedy in there but how did that help what you were doing when you were convinced such and\nI think it made it more human I've never seen a moment ... ... the moment where I didn't see humor you know our ember\nStanding at a grave site and the woman who writes for the body going down\nEvidently had just scratch harass and she did\nAnd I'm sending behind that I see this and how do you not smile at this and human nature such ... such there's a laugh to be found anywhere\nYou think the meanings greater because people are are laughing one minute and horrified the next when they when they watch episodes like those\nI think laughter out I'm confident that laughter is at a time to my life\nNorman Lear thank you\nMr Margolis\n[laughter]

D. one often on line and Katie's Edward community supported public radio from UT Austin stay tuned Jim Amoss joined do next is going to take you through\nThe afternoon programs I\nThink it's coming up next one o'clock\nI'm Chris boy I think some think the surprising reach of US Customs and border protection and why you could have a run in with them without getting anywhere close to the border of a sudden this hour with journalists Melissa that lost their who's reporting found CBP has been allowed to arrest and detain people with no Miranda warnings no warrant\nAnd a very loose interpretation of the Fourth Amendment\nWe'll talk about why the nation's largest federal law enforcement agency operates with very little outside oversight and learn how common it is for us citizens to be caught up in CBP drag nets for alleged offenses unrelated to entrance into the country\nOur conversation starts after a short break\n...\n\nSo what happened when they had to admit to her ... you've done nothing wrong we can't find anything you can go they had a condition for well they asked\nThat she that she signed the papers saying that she had given her consent and they said well if you give us consent then we will cover the medical bills but if you don't give us consent then you're gonna have to pay the bills\nAnd it's going to be expensive and I mean she told me at the time she thought I thought they were just they couldn't be serious that they were going to build me for this on top of everything so she she was like I'm not going to give you my consent and I'm not going to pay for this\nBecause basic you know she said I basically felt like I was I was raped you know ...\nUm and so she didn't sign the consent forms and sure enough a few weeks later she started receiving bills from the hospital um as you said an opening more than fifty four hundred dollars worth of bills to pay for this horrendous ordeal that she'd been through\nI Can't even imagine how frustrating that would feel how surreal\nYeah I mean I Can't even imagine um and\nI think the the sad thing was that what she told me in our in our interview is that she thought well it's the government there is no way I'm ever going to win this so really she didn't seek out a lawyer because of the assault and what had happened\nTo her but because of the bills because she just wasn't going to pay them and she couldn't you know pay them so that was what led to her actually seeking legal help\nWhen she was at the hospital the staff there made it clear she was hardly the first person who'd been examined that way\n[noise] [noise] yeah and that's the Chilean part of it and and this is the thing with um customs and border protection um is that we really don't know how many times they've done this a because they don't collect data on\nSearches like this where they have no findings where there is no contraband or drugs so there's no way of seeing how many of these types of searches have occurred uh where they didn't find anything like what happened with more than double\nSo according to their records it's almost like it never happened\nIt's like it never happened unless the person comes forward and complains [noise] um yeah\nAnd and lawyers with the ACLU which is who a son of all turn to to get legal help with her case\nUm they suspect that a lot of people that are violated in this way found to be innocent of carrying any contraband or whatever are still intimidated to bring a complaint about what's happened to them\nYeah I mean her lawyer or when he was doing a ... they did end up taking this case to court I'm with a hospital and was CBP and\nAnd in talking to a medical personnel at the hospital the the lawyer who who I'm represented her told me that he got the sense that they had done this before that it was somewhat\nI I don't want to say commonplace for that have happened before and that they thought you know we have to do this because this is law enforcement\nI have to wonder what this is costing customs and border patrol if most people fill out that form an retroactively give permission because they don't want to have to pay the bill\nYeah I mean it would be good to know I did several um freedom of Information Act request to try to find out even how many of these types of searches that they do\nUm but they came back saying you know we don't have any data on on how many of these searches that come back with no findings that we do\nAnd then they said with actual findings I think it was less ... less than twenty of these types of searches in twenty sixteen that was the most recent data that they had for me\n[noise] so the constitution is supposed to protect everyone against\nIt's unreasonable search and seizure by government agencies what's different about customs and border protection\nWill customs and border protection is is its own own entity\nIt it has um and has his ability to do um suspicion suspicion was searches at\nAt checkpoints and at the border um you can detain you on reasonable suspicion and not probable cause as is the case with um most law enforcement\nI'm\nSo they have the they have a wider latitude when it\nComes to searching and detaining people than your average law enforcement agency\nSo help me understand the difference in the sort of barrier of reasonable suspicion versus probable cause\nRight ah well probable cause means that the agent has to have facts about\nYou that make it probable that your committee near committed a violation of immigration law or federal law\nSo it's it's much more than just a hunch there has to be a a series\nOf uh affects that point to guilt or but with reasonable suspicion\nIt can be\nIt's a little less um road bust than probable cause a it's a little bit more than a hunch or a gut feeling but it's um they you know they have to have some specific facts but it's not um nearly as robust as probable cause is\nSo what is the legal reasoning for allowing customs and border protection sort of float above the laws that restrict virtually every other law enforcement agency in the country\nWell they were given these powers\nIn the late forties after World War two and I think because I'm customs and border protection is perceived as dealing with the borders protecting protecting the homeland and dealing largely with people who are not us citizens\nThat they were given these sort of sweeping powers to um you know search people without a warrant detain people I'm just based on reasonable suspicion\nYou're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd [noise] All right for anybody listening Melissa as I might be if I hadn't read your article listening and thinking well that was terrible for Laura ... of all but I don't trust the U.S border by land um there was a surprise coming tell us about that CBP has jurisdiction nationwide\nRight well this is this is the thing when when\nThis wide authority was given to them to do the uh warrantless searches and seizures and so forth they were about sixteen hundred um border agents in the country you know we're talking about the mid to late forties Nineteen forties there is now you know twenty thousand agents\nUm there's twenty thousand border patrol agents and there's about twenty three thousand US Customs agents so combined CBP now is the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country so they have a ... you know quite a lot more reach and a lot more\nUm agents than they've they've ever had so also in the fifties they were given up two hundred miles from the border\nAs they're sort of zone of authority and that actually encompasses about two hundred million people that's you know Houston it's Los Angeles a lot of major um metropolitan areas are within that zone of authority\nSo as they've increased in their size so has their\nExpansion within that zone and within the interior of the United states\nIncluding the entire state of Michigan the entire state of Florida because they happen to be a sort of geographically set up in such a way that they are close to borders throughout the entire territory right it can\nBe a land or coastal border and they consider the great lakes and maritime border so they consider all of Michigan within their zone of authority\n[noise] so what was happening during like the red scare that caused people just think it was a good idea to extend this kind of reach for customs and border patrol which back then were two separate agencies like was there evidence of some sort of communist incursions across the southern border\nWell it's interesting I think a lot of the rhetoric was around communism and around you know this is after World War two and this fear of you know Soviet agents or somebody coming into the United states and you know harming harming citizens but really\nWhat these authorities were used against actually were um mostly I'm Mexican I'm Brett federal workers and uh this is leading up to um operation went back in Nineteen fifty for the year before\nThey expanded um\nThis reasonable distance of a hundred miles from the border\nAllowing agents to go inland more to do deportations and so forth and so what they ended up doing was rounding up\nA Mexican agricultural workers sometimes us citizens as well and and deporting them\nMy guess is journalist Melissa that will scare her Harper's article checkpoint nation was reported in partnership with the investigative fond of the nation Institute and the Texas Observer will come back in two minutes [noise]\nUm [noise]\nIt was among the intelligence agencies over the attacks and and they wanted to sort of streamlined\nI think domestic or intelligence agencies make them more um interconnected so that they were communicating all as one so that what they did is they folded that all these various disparate agencies under one giant umbrella which is department of homeland security\nAnd so then they put in US Customs and border patrol into one agency\nBut to be clear none of the nine eleven hijackers cross land borders to get it right no no they did it [noise]\nUm how does it happen that customs and border protection officer is often get called out on cases that are under the normal jurisdiction of say a county sheriff in Washington state how how how would you call CBP in a case like that\nYeah and that's been another interesting trend with border patrol especially along the northern border is in rural communities especially you'll see them they'll see border patrol called in as you're just a regular they'll respond in nine one one calls for instance\nUm or there'll be called in to translate if if somebody you know there was a case in the state of Washington where\nA gentleman called in speaking Spanish um because his son was having a mental health\nUm breakdown and breaking windows in their house and so they sent a border patrol because they said they needed them there to to translate and that ended up um ... actually one of the a\nLaw enforcement people their shot at the the man and border patrol as well and they ended up killing him\n[noise] what is the relationship between local law enforcement agencies and CBP a in places where CBP is also a presence I mean are they do they think of themselves as as collaborators to CBP have the ultimate authority how does that work I think they think\nOf themselves as collaborators and as as responders um when needed I noticed in in Michigan what happens a lot of time there in in traffic stops if the people in the car speak Spanish or they don't speak\nEnglish very well they'll call border patrol in um so it seems like the traffic police state police work a lot in tandem with border patrol\nUm we've seen that here in Texas as well um where they will follow up on traffic stop 'em I think we've seen them less as nine one one responders here but that that there have been doing that up and I'm In the northern border\nDoes that come to that creative tasks that assumption closer to the northern border that people who speak Spanish but not English might somehow be here illegal or pose a illegally or pose a threat to the country well\nThat's the question you know why if you speak Spanish or if you speak you know English with a broken you know accent why should border patrol be cold and the first place and were they able to give you an answer [noise]\nUh no I mean that's that's the thing they're they're totally opaque about it I mean there's been lawsuits to to prevent them from you know responding to nine one calls in from profiling people um and in I think the latter part of the last\nOf on the term um they had gotten better about it and more responsive to the community and and not a\nYou know showing up for nine one one calls and so forth but now it's kind of gone back I think to the way that it was before a where there's a lot of mixing between the police and and border patrol and that's really been encouraged by the current administration that they that they work in tandem together this distinct I'm Chris Boyd\nMy guest this hour as journalists Melissa that will scare her article in Harper's is called checkpoint nation it was reported in partnership with the investigative fund of the nation Institute also the\nTexas Observer [laughter] um okay so who's the charges overseeing customs and\nBorder patrol and making sure that it is I'm serving honorably as an agency and and effectively and and everything else that we want from our law enforcement agents\nWill there's therein lies the question who who is responsible for oversight um the department of homeland securities off us office of inspector general has some purview over them\nUm but they have been a there's been a lot of scandal there in recent years because they were not following through on investigations into misconduct in the ... and and so forth and then CBP has its own internal affairs office\nWhich went through some reform\nBut the problem is they have not been able to hire enough internal affairs officers to really um [noise] over see all of the complaints and in misconduct of such a a large agency\nSo when you say hadn't been able to hire them is that because there's there's no will to hire them because there's no money to hire them or because nobody wants these jobs I think\nThere's not enough funding there to hire them and it doesn't seem to be any will I think Congress has always\nYou know and the president are always really focused on you know say boots on the ground getting more agents on the ground but there's very little focus on accountability\nUh what quality of agent you have out there I'm In the force and oversight you you hear them very seldom talk about oversight\nAnd in fact I'm just a few years ago they um they appointed I'm a I'm a a panel\nOf law enforcement experts to sort of look at their um oversight and their internal affairs system and\nAnd you know it was pretty scathing report they said you know there's just no way right now I'm under the current circumstances to root out corruption within the agency it can be going on for years we have no idea they're understaffed and their internal affairs department\nUm the training is not there um they they made quite a few recommendations but none of those recommendations have really been followed through other than giving some of the internal will giving internal affairs of CBP\nUm investigated Tori I'm powers but then at the same time they have not um they've not hired the number of agents that the committee had recommended that they hire\nSo if I understand you correctly they can make these recommendations but there's no one in charge of a follow through right right [noise] I was really surprised to learn that in some places a customs and border protection officers get cash bonuses for making arrest yes\nYeah that was a finding in in one lawsuit in New York was that they were\nUm getting cash bonuses and vacations and so forth based on their quota of arrests\nAnd for people who say well maybe that means they're doing good work what's the concern about cash bonuses for arrest\nWell it's quantity right it's like it's a dragnet mentality towards policing which always always um falls on the shoulders of people of color I mean they're the the first ones that are going to be harassed and the first ones that are going to be detained\nMy guest is journalists Melissa that will scare her Harper's article is called checkpoint nation it was a report it as part of a partnership with the Texas Observer and the investigative fund as a nation Institute will come back to this conversation in two minutes\n...\n[noise]", "show_name": "Think", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "08"}
