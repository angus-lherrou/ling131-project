U.

forgive him or that I still love him certainly not from a romance in a romantic way\nUm but I don't I don't hate him I don't forgive him I think that I can hold anger for what he did in my heart and in my mind at the same time\nThat I reject the impulse\nTo um to want to destroy\nWhat's really surreal is that this is the twenty first century which means there are ways to sort of know what someone is doing even if they have escaped to South America where they can't be extradited um what does his life look like to you now through the lens of social media\n[noise] I mean it doesn't look particularly happy you know I Am able\nTo see his life only a little bit because of social media so I can see\nPeople who are connected to him who who tag him and photos or attack his you know the people who I now\nRecognize as his daughters are his partner and photos and you know he doesn't he looks\nYou know as unhappy in his new life as he ever was in the one he lived with me um there's a way in which I'm able to look at the photographs and tell myself a story I guess about what's what's behind them the way you know there's a certain kind of\nExpression and you know his partners I send in their daughter's eyes that make me confident I Know what they are going through because I spent you know several years of my life in a relationship with him which was\nYou know ... abusive and in in all the ways that you can imagine it would be and so I I I see the photographs of him and realize he is not a changed person and that he continues to\nUm perpetrate the same violence is an injustice is on other people as that cheated on me\n[noise] do you think he thinks about what he did you [noise] I don't really know what he thinks about um I think if he thinks about it at all\nHe has told himself a version of the story where he is the victim in this and that and and\nTold me as much you know and I write about this a little in the other side because so I got away and he got away there was a a little bit of time during which I was working\nWith law enforcement here in the United states to try to lure him back into the country and so I ended up corresponding with him for a little while\nAnd and during that correspondence he made clear that I had misunderstood what had happened to me well\nThat I had misunderstood the kidnapping um that I had misunderstood the rapes that I had misunderstood his intention to kill me as really just an expression of his extreme devotion to me and how he in fact was a victim\nUm in all of this uh and he was a victim of my of his love for me um and so if he thinks about me at all I'm sure he thinks about it in that context or has told himself a version of the story\nIn which he is my victim rather than the other way around\nI think I Would find that\nUnbearable\nI guess the point is you don't have a choice but to bury right\n[noise] right [noise] um\nAnd that a lot of times when we think about another person's experience and imagine it being unbearable um ... you know it\nI don't know what else what what not being able to bear it looks like now my will to survive was stronger\nThan my um my desire to give up [laughter] or to or to feel pain um that that my um determination to live past this was the stronger than my capacity for pain I think\nBut I Want to be clear because there's no doubt in your mind that what happened to you when you were Twenty one what was done to you it it changed you forever you're you have no illusions about\nThat [noise] no not at all uh I and I think um [noise] and it changed me in\nDifferent kinds of ways so you know at\nFirst and and still I continue to have an in capacity for\nRecklessness [noise] you know and um to to be spontaneous um I I don't like being surprised even sometimes when it's a good surprise I don't I'm not very capable of being adventurous or doing things on the spur of the moment\nI'm In in the way that I was before you know before all this happened I was um you know before I met him I was you know oh a wild girl you know and in ways that may have\nA you know I'm I may have made some poor choices that got me into that relationship in the first place but I'm finding now myself [noise]\nLet's see Eighteen years after that experience I Am a stronger person now\nThan I was before I'm capable of doing things now that I wasn't capable of doing this for having survived this and having carried\nThis pain with me all these years has made me I'm ... has shown me a potential that I may not have discovered if it hadn't happened\nSo there are ways in which it has changed me in ways that I regret but also in ways that I Would\nRefuse to get when you say that you do wish for a reckoning what does that mean to you [noise] I think\nIt means a couple of things um I Want him to hear from me\nThe pain that he caught I Want him to to not only hear it\nUm you know the full tale of it these are all the ways um that you harm me I'm not just even\nUm you know the kidnapping and rape and an and attempted murder which was by far the most acute and most\nUm [noise] you know ... and the way that things are spectacles but wasn't the first time he harm to me and may not have even been the worst way that he harmed me you know I write in the ... about how\nI think the most enduring harm that he caused was\nChanging the story that I told myself about the person I could be on that that was the worst violence that he committed against me\nUm and so to to to be able to tell him all of that is I think the first part\nAnd the second part is that he\nReflects that back to me and takes ownership of that harm to say yes I did these things to you and to not only admit that to me but that to to admit it in public\nUm so that it's not um something where my testimony where my witness could be called into account that everyone is there to bear witness\nTo that to to what I say I'm as being true and being valid and that he validate that experience back to me and then\nUm the third part is\nI'm not necessarily for him to suffer or to be punished which is not I'm sort of I'm not intending to give up my right to you know pursue legal action against him\nBut that he um he spends his life in service to other people's joy [laughter] you know she took so much joy and capacity for joy out of my life\nI think it would be justice for him to spend the rest of his life putting it back in [noise]\nLike asked is right or at least ...

[noise]\nFull under to underestimate the trauma um because if we grappled with the ... it's full I'm just the full implications\nTo full damage that rape does that we would um have it it would cause us discomfort or not just discomfort pain I was um you know during the the Kavanaugh hearings I was reminded um that\nYou know this moment is not the first time that there's been a kind of\nAttempted reckoning with the violence of uh with the epidemic of sexual violence against women um Freud wrote\nUm you know before he became the father of psychoanalysis\nHe wrote I'm a ... a a document called the ideology of hysteria [noise] um where she was talking he had interviewed um all these women who were suffering from hysteria and and hysteria at that time was a very common diagnosis\nUm for what we I think now understand to be the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder\nBut at that time he was trying to figure out what was causing this epidemic of hysteria among women\nAnd what she discovered was that at the root of every instance of hysteria he could find was\nAnd are really experience of um sexual assault of abuse of incest and he wrote about this and this document the ideology of hysteria which is still remains a remarkable document of of someone\nListening to women talk about their experience and believing them [noise] but once he began to realize that if his own ideas if his own conclusions were true that it meant that assault abused and incest\nWas so widespread that it touched every sphere of society even reached into his very own family\nAnd then spent the rest of his career I'm undermining his own conclusions because he said well like you know that can't be right because um that would mean\nThat that that every woman are so many women I Know so many women have experienced that and not just can't be possible um because that that tells me something about the world that I don't want to believe\nAnd I think now in this moment of you know it's it's useful to undermine or the ... the damage and the harm to sexual assault does I'm not only two women um but to society you know it's useful because if we I'm\nFully into the back end with it um we would have to face and very uncomfortable and painful trees about who we are as a society [noise]\nYou make a point even in very brief description of what happened to you um you make a point of of letting people know that you're right next to someone you once loved and I wonder if that's deliberate because\nWe're even worse about acknowledging the reality that I'm a rape by an acquaintance or even a loved one is equivalent to rape by some stranger who grabs you in an alley\nSure and I think that you know it also has to do with\nMy intention to um you know underline\nThat fact that I'm rape isn't necessarily something that monsters do or where the ideas that we might share the myths that we might share about the kind of person than a rapist and\nYou know we imagine this stranger hiding in the bushes in the park the person who lives in weight to sort of grab an innocent girl I'm In the stranger a but in fact\n... far more often people who rape our our men we know and care about and maybe even love\nAnd that the kind of person that rate this isn't a monster but a person who's been taught\nAll their lines to value their own experience as being more important than others and to to think that they are more human than in there\nAnd that that is the um what what makes a rapist is as someone who who thinks that they matter more than anyone else this just think I'm Chris Boyd\nSupport comes from the twelfth annual run for the water on November fourth benefiting the good cell foundation helping to provide clean drinking water and changing lives in Burundi Africa registration and information for the five K. ten miles and kids gay at run for the water dot com\nSupport comes from ... the seller focused way to sell real estate in Austin dedicated to creating an experience where homeowners meet their goals when selling their home details at ... dot com that's J.
