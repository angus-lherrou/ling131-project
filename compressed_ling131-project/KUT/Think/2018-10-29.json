talks about his critically acclaimed novel there which tells the story of urban Indian people navigating their Native American heritage while living far away from any reservation [noise]\nOrange himself is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne wrap them tried for the Houma but he grew up in Oakland, California often surrounded by people who could only conceive of American Indians and the relative to pass\nWith orange about the shattering prologue he rose to ... non native lawyers with the history they weren't taught in school and about the ways he was late personally to the character he created for this book conversation start after a short break\nTo [noise]\n\nI think is it um your character dean oxen dean who ... who thinks of himself as looking ambiguous Lee non white\n[noise] [noise] yeah and you know being in the bay area there's actually plenty of biracial people and people that are mixes of different things and um we still get asked like what are you the question comes up because it's not [noise]\nPeople don't really know what the range the dynamic range of what native people can look like is because a lot of people don't even know native people and um there's a monolithic historical version of what it's what we're supposed to look like and that um\nLike iron eyes Cody who is not now [laughter] exactly you know it's usually something stereotypical or address or you know there are certain high cheekbones it's it's ridiculous thing that there's one certain way that we're supposed to look in generally with in the community\nWe know what we look like and we know the range and um so\nSo when you would um we've Oakland and go with your dad and visit his family in Oklahoma um was there a sense that they were tied in to your culture in a different way than you are\nI think there's definitely um [noise] I mean I didn't really get this but um there's definitely a tension between reservation native and news from the city regarding authenticity and what makes what makes you more native or less native there's\nThere's sort of that tension um for me it ... they're all kind of childhood memories of just seeing 'em and teasing grandmothers and um I was just back there not that long ago my sister lives there now and so it was my dad\nUm so I think the answer to your question I'm not sure yeah\nYeah I'm Sorry you said the book in Oakland where you grew up um [noise]\nAnd it feels very much like a like a like a trip through this city like people may not know Oakland but it feels very much like on the ground like you're talking about streets and and neighborhoods in areas of\nOf the city and um and I want to talk about the title of the book which comes from the Richard Stein quote there is no they're they're um ... and this is something that you've given a lot of thought to overtime\n[noise] um well I think\nNot only has the urban Indians story not really been in the media or in books but um Oakland has an ... kind of you know there's Jack London and there's Richard Stein and the only thing she wrote about is that she didn't write about it or\nYou know her her there is no they're they're line\nIs referring to in everybody's autobiography somebody's asking here what is she right about Oakland she says there is no there there and she just she means the the land that she grew up on them she was a kid\nWas developed over so there was no more there should be to write about a lot of people have used it to say that I'm ... now it's like a buzz word in the news talk about how it's a non issue or something but um\n[noise] people have used to talk about to talk down about open like there is no distinction or solar character to Oakland and so um it's almost more of a response to those people who have misused cartridge turns quote to talk about how Oakland doesn't have\nUm a character and um so I I wanted to write about the place that I'm from that to my home um I just love it there and and I didn't I couldn't find 'em any novels about Oakland so the first\nCharacter that you introduced us is Tony lawman who um [noise] is a young man he was affected by fetal alcohol syndrome and he's aware of this and aware that his physical appearance um tells people that there's something different about him\nBut he's also really aware of the he sort of reads people well and um he's got this kind of defiance\nAbout him can you tell us a little bit about what went into making that character [noise]\nUm\nThink\nNative stories I'm a native history is something that most people don't want to have to look at and so he's he's sort of stands and as a metaphor\nFor um for native history and um and\nThe idea that it makes people uncomfortable just to talk about it sometimes and that's what's been exciting about this for me so well received that normally people don't want to talk about it or they want to remember you know the version of history that is more convenient\n[noise] did you imagine that the book would\nFind an audience outside the native I mean obviously you're a gifted writer um you you were training for years but I'm ...\nDid you think about yourself writing or at a native audience and non native audience did you just not even think about that as you were writing\nUm well so I got my MSA from the Institute of American indian arts and I spent three years I'm reading the book outside of the program and then three years in the program um and I was aware that I could get a teaching job if I had a book so um\nI I thought maybe I could make it maybe it could be a book um and if I Would love to teach writing the sort of the goal [noise]\nUm so I thought maybe within the native Rand community that would be my end up reading a certain I certainly didn't I wasn't thinking of like one day of this will get you know this will reach whatever I got I was thinking the native world would be interested in what I'm writing about because that's not really how it goes\nIs there anything you would have done differently heads you know that you would have this level of readership and success with your first novel\nI think if somebody would have had a crystal ball and shown me what it would mean or I might I\nHesitate [laughter] as I said to ride it has a\nYeah I don't know what the exactly means I don't I don't regret writing or being a book I think um I think it was just comes with a lot but I didn't\nRealize would be a part of my life like now you're that like a\nSpokesman for an entire multimillion person group of individuals\nYeah and there's so many different um\nThe thing is you know I've I'm writing a story from a perspective and her over five hundred and Seventy five um tribes around the country all with very distinct cultures and languages and histories and and contemporary situations um my biggest hope\nAbout its successes that I'm publishers will\nPay attention to other native writers and know there are books can do well and people want to hear a our stories type certainly wouldn't want my me to become the new model if you know I certainly don't want to be there [noise] um I\nI there are so many characters that are really compelling in this I really loved or of all is a boy who has found himself he has this kind of compulsion to dance I'm not to do Palau dancing and um he's found this for ... like in his grandmother's closet and tried it on and he's almost\nLike he's afraid she's gonna catch him because he he doesn't quite ill right wearing it and they were interesting parallels there for maybe you know between um horrible situation if that's trying this identity and not being sure about it and and kids who maybe has been afraid that they would be found to be gay or transgender as something that\nFeels like part of them but they're not sure if they can show it to the world\n[noise] um [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean everyone in this novel has um\nHas a different proximity and to to what being native is or or how they feel about it and his mom [noise] um I mean his grandma um\nDoesn't necessarily want to\nTeach them and also it expresses that um he doesn't need to know information or be taught some particular culture for him to be ending and she says in there you're Indian because you're Indian because you're Indian um but tradition certainly plays a role in you know everyone's going to a power and um\nI put in power is sort of a central I'm setting or where everyone is going to end up because I'm I feel powers in urban India Indian experience or have parallels because they're very inter tribal cities tend to be in a tribal um but it's also a place where um\nYou see sort of a I have a line and there are about Indians dressed up as Indians um so I think there's always going to be a struggle and attention between how to be authentic and what does that look like and how to continue to be contemporary and to adapt to you know modern life and still feel\nIndian because if you need if you needed to be in the past than you know if you're on your way to disappearance yeah\nLike like you're wearing a T shirt and I guess genes are and and that's how you dress and you don't necessarily need to wear something that people would have won a hundred years ago\nYeah and at the same time it's actually an age sure and it was designed by native I'm a native artist from Oakland and it's you know it's done it was at the Native American heritage night at the Oakland Coliseum\nOr the day actually we got back from uh the tour there is their heritage and it costs and starts up how it answers on the field which was a surreal moment\nMy guest is novelist Tommy orange his novel is called there there if you would like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think K. E. R. A. dot org or find this on Twitter where ... are a think\nOoh\n\nHi yes I'm certainly I'm enjoying this conversation thank you for it I uh I'm Wondering author with a ... if the if the since ... other people have non native people have a hope\nIf that has affected or to what extent is it your sense of Oakland\n[noise] tortured question I Apologize\nOh that's okay hey Paul I'm a let me just make sure I Am getting the question right you're saying um do has does my vision of Oakland has it affected by the way outsiders think of Oakland or\nYes yes\nNo I mean I think I'm there definitely are misperceptions about Oakland and um\nAnd it's changed over the many years but it's for me it's home and um I sort of compartmentalized the way people think of Oakland and Oakland that I Know and they're just totally separate things it doesn't it doesn't um [noise] changed the way I think of Oakland\nOne eight hundred nine three three five three Seventy was our telephone number you can also email think at K. E. R. A. dot org [noise] um [noise] a lot of these characters are separated in some way from a parent and it made me think about the way that reverberates with so much history where families were torn apart\nUm yeah I think uh\nAnd I wanted to show there's a term that came around maybe a decade ago maybe longer called historical circle trauma I don't know if you've heard of it um\nAnd I worked in in mental health a Native American health center in Oakland for almost a decade um [noise] and\nSort of have been able to she just over the course of my life and work in the community in many ways that that um history plays out over time and one of those wages families not being together um for various different reasons maybe having to addiction or poverty or\nUm so I wanted to show 'em\nFor that reason I wanted to show histories effects on families now and what it looks like what alternative family situations you end up with 'em but also\nExploring um no I I grew up with both my parents um they got divorced when I was Thirteen [noise] um\nBut your connection to to your parents into your family um is a big part of the way you form your identity and what you can give yourself in the world so I just wanted to explore that many different um iterations of of\nThat in in um Oakland native ... um community and what that can look like\nHow did your parents when they were married and I don't need all the details of their divorce I'm not I'm not plumbing for that but how did they talk about the ways that they were different culturally\nSo my mom um met my dad in northern New Mexico in the seventies choose sort of a wandering hippie and he was um he got up to learn 'em\nA ceremony from a guy in Pueblo guy\nAnd a ... this was um does your Native American church which is a parody ceremony\nSo they met in that context and\nEventually um they lived in Oklahoma for awhile venture came out to Oakland and by that time my mom had become an evangelical Christian and my dad had continued to be I'm a Native American church member um and he'd be gone off and on weekends so this\nWas actually a big source of um fights because according to evangelical Christianity I'm Patty use to sort of demonic thing and so I was\nConstantly I was aware of um this cultural difference there wasn't that there's not that much you know white culture is not necessarily a thing it's sort of the dominant culture or the default maybe\nUm but being shy and are being native is a distinct thing um it's not just a default each so I was always aware of this inherent conflict and also watch for fighting happened in the house and there was a religious pieces to it and also like you know having a white mother in Indian father\nYou know with with history has been there's been ... conflict there that I just felt was a part of our ... our life our family\nThey just think I'm Chris ... did you feel like you had to um after they were living apart did you feel like you had to be a different version of yourself depending on who you are saying\nNo no I I never um\n[noise] you know divorce is hard on every kid me um but that that that wasn't part of it for me I never felt like um it changed me in that way\nShe mentioned that you work in um mental health at ... ... is an Indian Health service\nIt's a the Native American how centers in the name of it and I I'm\nI'm ... you were collecting stories they're right I mean not maybe deliberately but you were hearing a lot of people's experience\nYeah and actually did a story telling project there um and I worked for many years as a digital storytelling storytelling facilitator out of a nonprofit I'm In Berkeley called story center\nUm and you go and teach 'em non writers had to write compelling three minute personal stories and then had a um use digital editing software and they come up with a three minute videos that are usually used on usually communities that are under represented and they use these stories to kind of get\nA positive messaging and\nTheir their stories out in the world\nThat extraordinary experience for a novel that\nIt was um and ah\nI I Love to the work I I Wish I could still do it but I'm I'm doing this [noise]\nSo ... who is ... grandmother um and is raising him and his two brothers um her mother was adamant that they had to kind of on their stories and tell their stories and open grows up and sort of moves away from that and I feel\nLike he writes very sensitive about her like she's worn out she's got these three kids that are really her her grand nephews that she's taking care of\n... a lot going on and um and it's sort of understandable why maybe she feels like this is not one more thing that she can incorporate into her life but um [noise] did it feel different writing about a character who had moved away from at least an\nOutward expression of her name identity\nI think um\nI don't think I knew it at the time but in retrospect I think it was me trying to figure out um why my dad where her dad didn't teachers the language and what are the complicated reasons why we wouldn't have been you know he was an engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley labs and um\nHe was he worked full time and if you don't have to um language speakers in the house it's a lot of work to you know to try to get all your kid speaking the language [noise] um so I think I wanted you to understand better why we\nDidn't have a more um [noise] formative\nCultural education um and I you know I found out I found out over time that it's it's complicated and related to a pain in his own childhood growing up in Oklahoma um there was a lot of pain attached to his experience\nSo I I think through mobile I was exploring whether it will how could that how would that ended up happening or why would she have a feeling like she doesn't necessarily want them to\nHave to learn one way to be Indian or let them figure it out um any kind of had that approach you let us all figure it out for ourselves and I'm also you know\nLot of what it means to be shyness is so embedded in his way of being um that he knew it would it would be transmitted without having to do anything\nHow do you think your life would be different if you were fluent in shame\nUm I Can't even imagine you know so much of culture is imbedded in language and my sister just became fluent and I'm I'm slowly I'm moving toward trying to understand the language better um but I Can't imagine what it would it would be like to be a totally different person\nYeah especially for someone who had to traffics in words and in terms of understanding people through the way that they speak in through writing about them um is there like is there at a shy and phrase that you're aware of that you're like that is\nSomething really important Mm I'm\nYou know I'm just starting to get into it and if I'm working on a autobiographical family novel and I'm an ... I Want to shine language to be kind of a character and so I I'm ... I'm studying it for those types of things but I I Will tell you on the spot [laughter]\nI don't have one on one hand um but there are things that I'm studying about it already that are super interesting will be in the in you know\nMy guess is not less Tommy orange his critically acclaimed debut book is called their their if you'd like to join us you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think K.
