underway this week in New Mexico\nThe Albuquerque international balloon fiesta draws hundreds of hot air balloons and hundreds of thousands of spectators from around the world and for Troy Bradley and his daughter savannah it's a family affair they're both hot air balloon pilots in our flying in this year's event Troy savannah welcome to hear now how's the flying in Albuquerque\nExcellent yeah we had a beautiful flight this morning so it's all going very well down here\nGood Troy I Want to start with you um you you're you're kind of famous in this world you've set some records you're also a member of the U.S ballooning hall of fame and you come from a long line of hot air balloon is how'd you how'd the Bradley family\nGet involved so the ah the original pilot in the family with my grandfather um he was one of the first put us in Colorado so I was fortunate enough to grow up flying balloons with him and was able to uh started a young age it is an expensive hobby so it's not something that every child can necessarily a start with so\nFortunately my grandfather was a pilot um drug me around to a lot of blue and rallies when I was young and I caught the bug and said I wanted to learn to fly and so um I was able to get my private pilots typically have a right after my sixteenth birthday I was scheduled to go for my check ride\nOn my sixteenth birthday was eight days after that that the the examiner was actually a bubble and the weather cooperated so uh\nThat's what I was able to get my ... so I mean is that how old you have to be sixteen to fly blurb for for private pilots ticket yes she can be a student pilot prior to that\nAnd actually my son Bobby was the youngest person in the world to solo in a hot air balloon at age nine but he did it in an ultralight bloom so there's no pilots to ... or age requirements for an ultralight\nSo it's a family affair savannah what about you do you always know he wanted to join in the family business\nUh no actually when I was little I had no desire to become a pilot and\nI was just happy being a proud member of the ground crew and just helping out wherever I could but something clicked when I was Thirteen and I just kind of decided you know what like I'm going to start my training and I so loaded on my fourteenth birthday and got my license on my sixteenth birthday\nWhile one of the things I Love about the Albuquerque fiesta is the pictures of all those balloons just hanging in the air there so colorful they're beautiful what's your balloon look like this year\n[noise] uh the one that I'm flying actually is a a beautiful blue in with the orange red and yellow colors and it has the as the assemble which is the state symbol for a for a New Mexico or on the equator on two sides\nSo I'd definitely stands out it's pasteurized balloon so I'm Carrying twelve passengers every morning with me and this is my fortieth the fiesta that I've attended I've fallen thirty seven of them and I'm Still in all every single time it's a beautiful sight out\nThere it is ... what's your balloon look like\nA balloon is black on the bottom with a rainbow the rainbow colors coming down from the top and it's a balloon that holds or about a four people and it's amazing and this is my third year in fiesta but I've seen it every year in my life and I love it\nSavannah we heard how your dad as this experience sort of celebrated pilot what's it like to have him as your guy does he given you tips for flying over the years\nI'm definitely I actually funny enough I didn't want to learn how to fly from my dad 'cause as great as he is he's my dad\nWas telling you what to do your homework flyer balloon [laughter]\nYeah so I had a different instructor but now especially as I'm becoming a more experienced pilot he's been a very very great mentor and helped me to work towards the things I Want to accomplish\nRight I'm sure you're very comfortable up there in the sky but do you worry about your daughter up in a balloon\nOf course because it's so my daughter so as as accomplished as she is and I know how good of a pilot she is um I still require after every landing to give me a call and let me know that she's down and safe show yeah I'm Still bad for sure what what are the risks up there so Heinz guy\nThe risks are nominal um provided that you're a really uh you know paying attention it's like any other form of aviation um the number of accidents that happen are very rare and then it's infrequent however when they do or they can have some dire consequences so um the the real risk that are out there and\nAre mitigated by you know good calls on on the field before you ever take off so it's really pilot judgment and making sure that the pilots picking a good day to fly\nWell there are some changes to the fiesta this year one drone will be allowed to fly with the balloons to take pictures and there have been some concerns or by local pilots maybe you're one of them about not having enough places to land because the area around Albuquerque is becoming more developed\n... what about that if you notice any big changes to your sport\nOh the the Albuquerque areas definitely changed dramatically like um when I started flying the entire north part of Albuquerque was not built up into anything is still open fields\nAnd now we're really truly flying into congested area every single flight so um but the city of Albuquerque is very very balloon friendly so the city itself designates that basically any school park golf course anything this city owned is open and and welcoming to balloon is\n[noise] that's Troy Bradley and his daughter ...\nWho are hot air balloon pilots flying in the forty seven\nAlbuquerque international balloon fiesta [noise]\nThinks people

who really didn't seem to care their daughter was different from them they hardly even talked about\nThey also hardly understood what it was like for her\nWhite bullies or Asian features wondering why she couldn't be white like her classmates favorite literary characters they also didn't know how important it would be for ... below the simplified story they told me about why she was put up for adoption in the first place [noise] our conversation about all that starts after a short break\n...\n[noise]\nEverything will work out great um and of course certain things did and other things I think we all could have been maybe better prepared but it it certainly wasn't any lack of trying on their part to get a different or maybe more complete answers\nYeah and of course it didn't mean that race wouldn't matter to you because I'm the force you say you were in like second or third grade when when the taunting started from your classmates like they noticed and articulated the ways that you were different anymore mean about\nThe more I mean it wasn't everybody but it was enough it started with one or two\nUm and yeah I was in second or third grade the first time I would call the slur I didn't know that's what the word for it I you know I wouldn't have had that vocabulary to describe it but that's what it was um it was an Asian slur and delivered complete with like pulled back eyes and\nAnd all of that um and it didn't really just stop with that that first instance that continued and kind of spread and it was something I dealt with\nReally until leaving that school a tiny bit in middle school not so much when I was older\nUm but that was the most obvious like I guess blatant way of an ... cruelest way that it was pointed out to me these differences but they're also the questions from people you knew and from strangers you know people who would ask\nAt church or in the grocery store teachers who would ask me and my first day in their class you know what's the deal I'm so it it was definitely not just um like from kids and not just bullies you know I think I also encountered like kind of a series of ... more micro aggression type of a situation and question\nYeah it seems like for your parents race blindness translated in a way to kind of racism when it's like they didn't mean to not notice these things that were hurting you but they\nLike for example when you came home and said you were bullied they were like just ignore it and it will go away and that that didn't work\nWell I told them I told them I had been picked on for being adopted that which which was hurtful and which was true but I didn't actually tell them I didn't know how to describe what had happened I was so confused on that day\nUm and I didn't have the words to call it racism or I didn't know what a slur was I didn't know how to tell them I just I thought they wouldn't understand and I felt like I had to protect them a little bit from\nFrom the knowledge of how much my my race definitely did seem to matter so when I told them I was being picked on for being adopted that's when the advice came to just ignore it and it would go away\nUm but I wouldn't tell them about the racism that I experienced at school for many years I think probably when I was in my late teens early twenties is when we started talking about that\nYou take pains to know in the books that um the the failure to sort of recognize everything that you were going through was not unique to you or white parents like as you mentioned they had asked for some advice and the choices that they made were like typical of a whole generation\nWhat's interesting is when you talk about them asking for advice it sounds like they didn't seek out an adult to had been adopted by a couple of another race and ask that person\nWhat they might need to know\nNo they didn't I don't think they knew any adult adoptees I mean adoption certainly been common for a long time and transracial adoptions and Korean adoptions\nAre from Korea were very very common but I don't think they knew anybody or really close to people they could ask\nA it's like a deeply personal question to ask another person so I think even if they known adult adoptees of color\nIt would depend on the relationship as to whether or not they sat down and asked like let's let's be really real telling me everything he went through and tell me what I should know\nThat's asking a lot of labor of that that person um so yeah I I don't know but there wasn't really you know in my in my small community in Oregon I don't think there were a lot of people that they could have gone to\nSo you've had people ask you use the questions do you notice how hard it is to summarize your entire life for Michael who were way what do you think they want to hear\nMe when they ask you that question I\nThink some of them want to be reassured that many many truly want real information they really do want to know what my experience was like not because their child will necessarily face the same things I mean\nIt's just my story it's not representative of every adoption or every Korean adoptee your average trans racial adoptee but with all those disclaimer is\nYeah I think often people are just looking to listen and maybe learned from someone else's experience a little bit um\nMaybe some do really want to be reassured that everything will be okay um but yeah I I don't know I I really I think it's great when people do seek out and really listen to the stories of adult adoptees\nAnd at the same time I want to be clear like I I don't necessarily think it's always appropriate to go asking people to share those personal details right story is about their live um but yeah when I get questions I I think people are just genuinely curious most of the time [noise]\nWhen did you start to realize there were things you didn't know about your own origin story that you were curious about\nThat was always curious about things we didn't know like simple obvious\nThings like what are their names what other hobbies whether they do for a living I'm a you know I had a lot of questions I wondered if I have siblings and if I did what they were like\nUm things like that and I wondered I guess if we had any shared interests right or\nI've always really loved writing and I liked music and I wondered what my birth family musical you know things like that um I always kind of wondered about those things I think not knowing though it was much easier to live with when I was younger um and it really wasn't until I was in my mid to late twenties where it\nJust felt like I I had to try and find answers you know that's where it got to the that is when it got to the point where not knowing became really difficult\n[laughter] do you did your parents have any of those same questions they they could have asked more than they did when they adopted you about about your birth family\nNo way I understand it from things they've told me is they didn't want to know too much um it was a closed adoption and which was really common standard at the time and open adoption for domestic incident placement\nAt that point would have been unusual us so it was pretty typical and I think they were honestly afraid of the idea of an open adoption just not really sure how it would work\nWould I be confused with baby confused when they have to share me um I don't know I I really think they just didn't want to know too much at the time and they were also afraid if we ask too many questions you know what if it doesn't go through\n'em so really they they took like what they were given and didn't push for more information\n[noise] vicious think I'm Chris Boyd one really\nUnusual part of the story of how you came to be adopted was that um you discovered your birth parents had been married they had a reasonably stable business they they didn't seem like the typical candidates to be placing a child for adoption\nUnderstood\nIt they were definitely having some financial struggles and you know they they had been trying to establish a family business for a few years but I don't think it was um [noise]\nI I'm not sure it's hard for me to get a full picture of the ... of what it was like at that time so maybe stables overstating it but it was they were they were they were married they had other children at home um\nAnd the social worker who handle the adoption told my adoptive parents she was confused by their decision um and said I told them they didn't have to do this and\nI really feel that um I I Know that they were they were convinced they had to do it that it was the best decision um but yeah it was it was a slightly slightly unusual circumstances I suppose\n... ... and then of course they had other children there's the question um that you were really curious about like what were those children told about why would they be never came up\n\nAlways assumed for some reason\nThat they would have been told about the adoption maybe not right away ah well I didn't know I had siblings to be clear but I figured if I did they would know the truth at some point maybe not as children but when they got older you know I searched as an adult so by the time that happened they were also adults\nI thought by then they would have been told 'em but as it happened my sister and my little sister are both told that I died in the hospital so when I got in touch with my birth family it was a complete shock to them you know as little information that I'd had they were working with a lot less\nUh so that was definitely a surprise for me and I remember feeling a little bit guilty to for just sort of intruding in their lives with this huge shock I about something I I guess I had assumed they would at one point have learned um so that was that was that was hard yeah they\nThey were happy to get to know you but it was it was a real shock\nYeah discovered exists right yes they were both really kind and gracious to me and um but at the same time I I yeah I I wasn't sure what to make of it I really did think that at some point they would have learned the truth\nMy guess is Nicole chunk she's editor in chief of catapult magazine and author of the new memoir called all you can never know if you'd like to join our conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think K. E. R. A. dot org or find us on Twitter We're AT T E R a thing [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nOf our parents but not raised with them um and not a product of their um their parenting so yeah I think we've both kind of seen possibilities and the other's life but it's so hard it's so hard to imagine a reality that's not the one that you've lived\nAs your own um so yeah it's been interesting for both of us in really meaningful but I Can't remember specifically if she's asked me that that particular question\nAll right let's go to the phones our number is one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to ... you can also email think at K. E. R. A. dot org or friends on Twitter at K. E. R. E. think we have grace calling from Beaumont Hi grace\nI might call yes Hi you sound great\nOh I'm so tired I started listening to um my father was adopted and ... years ago that uh we\nWork with is a turtle family um my grandmother had ... years ago we were able to fill up with that I worry a\nGrandmother or like I Would really bring it on me\nPersonally um I like I read a lot of clarity about\nHe might be a lot more about my grandmother was a very profound for me\nSo I Would um any type of area like that would\nHave acted with her family when he heard the story if they have any clarity about oh\nWell thank you so much for your call ... those are really good questions what can you say about that nickel\nYeah absolutely um you know I I go very loved I Want to stress that and I did really feel like my adoptive family was my family but there were all these these little things and I don't imagine this is unique to adoptees I think lots of people born into their families [laughter]\nWhat about you and moments like exactly like climate with these people [laughter] but I I always kind of felt like the very lovable treasured alien in the family like I was very different not just looks I mean like personality interests I was really musical and my parents can't carry a tune and I\nRemember I pushed myself really hard and I had all this internal pressure and I love to write and these things were just foreign to them like they couldn't understand them um and so when I did reconnect with and start talking with some members of my birth family like a lot of them are were very different people too but like we share this certain intensity and drive I think um\nMy birth father and my sister also right and that was kind of amazing to find out\nUm we share weird little techs I don't I don't know that it's genetics it doesn't make sense to me but like just weird little takes my sister and my father and I we all have this habit where we like\nRight with our finger on surfaces like or right in the air while we're talking I'm I don't know why I don't see a lot of people doing it but we all the all three of us do it and then when I met my sister just seen similar expressions on her face that like match mine as different as we are like I think there are a lot of similarities and\nIt it's been really special to see those connections I'm again just not being able to really recognize myself\nAnd anybody else in my family growing up and I I don't just mean like physical similarities I mean personality to um has been really neat to reconnect inexperienced that for the first time um and then I also see it you know because my mother I see it the same connections between me and my children and and that's really wonderful to\nKnow you've written a book about your husband like he couldn't stop taking pictures of you and your sister when you first met because he was seeing similarities than you were like cut it out but he was really ... by by the ways that you were like\nYeah those are husbands were just like it was like ping pong from her to me and back again and they point out every little thing we're also confused for one another sometimes like um like from the back my nieces mistaken me for her mom more than once and\nUh when I read in Portland the other night my sister was there and some of her friends were there and they said to me after seeing you read I saw a lot of expressions that I've seen on Sundays face it was so strange [laughter] so that that was kind of neat for me to hear two\nDistinct I'm Chris Boyd [noise]\nBefore you were in contact with your birth parents your birth mother and brother and we should say that they uh they divorced um years after you were born so they're not together but um\n[noise] what's there is something that you imagined hearing from them was there one thing you wanted them to say to you\nIt's such a good question I think what I really wanted deep down with for both of them to say that they loved me and that they did not regret I didn't want them to regret it and I didn't want them to feel ashamed at all because I I think I did understand what a difficult situation they were in and I really wanted to honor their decision in a way\nUm I wanted them to feel more at peace and they seem to I I was helping if we reconnected I could tell them one of these as I wanted to find them with so I could tell them you know thank you you gave me life like I Know it was a hard decision but it turned out okay you know things are hard sometimes but it turned out okay and\nUm I don't know I really wanted to honor their decision and it's not something I think they do feel real piece about I don't think\nI don't think it's I mean they necessarily think about every day I don't think a ... it's not like they haven't moved on because you have to move on in life but\nI was hoping maybe hearing from me would give them some sense of peace or if not closure resolution and I do feel like I have not been able to give that maybe it's it's taught me a lot about the limits of um [noise]\nUh I've just being able to provide that for somebody else like we're all on our own journey then that's not something I can give them as much as I Want to [noise] um I you know I guess one day I Would really like both of them to feel at peace with the decision that they made as hard as it was\nDo you feel like you've got a satisfactory answer as to why they made that decision\nI Do I think they were just in a very difficult situation um and it was true that they were you know not completely stable financially they didn't have health insurance the doctors were telling them she's going to have a lot of problems she's going to need around the clock care\nI think they felt really overwhelmed and we're navigating child welfare and legal system in a second language um I think and also there there was real and there's real dysfunction at home they were real problems at home that um made things more complicated so\nIt's hard for me to see I guess of course they could've made another choice you can always make a different choice but I understand like why they felt it was the only decision\n[noise] so your birth father characterized it to you as as your birth mother really sort of spearheading that decision and and the one question you could never bring yourself to ask him directly was if he wanted to keep you\nThere are there are only two possible answers to that question I Wonder which is the one you could there [noise]\nOh that's interesting well just to be really clear ah the way it's been presented to me by most members of the family is that it probably was his idea the adoption placement uh he did think that\nMy my grandfather to think that my birth mother wasn't necessarily um like equipped to care for me especially because I Would have been very vulnerable as a pre me that was um it was sort of the driving force behind his suggestion of adoption is the only option or the best option\nUm I did I still I still uh think about asking him did you want to keep me it's not something I've ever been able to ask\nA maybe in a way I don't want to know the answer I think I think one thing finding them and talking with them and\nWriting this book to has given me as the ability to really empathize with them and their situation it's not as simple as did you want a child or didn't you I mean really that's kind of an unfair question for me to ask\nBecause we might all want to provide things to a child and want to love the child and find ourselves in circumstances where it's just impossible that there's too much of life and\nThere are too many other crises and there are too many other things you're dealing with I really think their situation at the time was so difficult it's probably not as simple as did you want me or didn't want me but of course if I were to ask that the answer I Would want if if the U.S [laughter]\nUm I I Would want to hear that they did want to keep me and that you know they were sad to give me up I I think in a way of gotten that answer I think they were sad I think they have expressed regret maybe even more regret than I Would have wanted them to express\nMy guest is Nicole Chong she's editor in chief catapult magazine and author of a new memoir called all you can ever know if you'd like to join the
