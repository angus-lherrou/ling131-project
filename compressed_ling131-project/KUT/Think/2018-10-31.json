I think some think what a young black men learn when he Merced himself in white gun culture\nLetter R. J. young first picked up at the and that's the way to bond with your father in law proud and are a supporter who kept guns for hunting and for self [laughter] we'll talk with young about his experience as one of the only people of color and legendary Oklahoma gun show and why he feels he couldn't have gone to that his white father in law\nWill learn how he progress from a terrible shot to an NRA certified missile instructor and we'll find out how race played into his decision not to carry a gun or even keep ammunition in a weapon he has at home [noise] our conversation starts after a short break\n...\n[noise]\nOr a a should take that back it was the biggest revolver I'd ever seen then uh-huh right it's got a tourist judge on some folks are familiar with it but if you're not\nYou can cross load this revolver with for ten shotgun shells and forty five long cold it is self defense port right but it was also something he was very proud of because\nNot only come back with this pistol right he presented it to me like I might present I'm One of my prized possessions minimum huge Oklahoma football fan and I am not sorry about that [laughter] much\nIf I had a ... a football that was signed by Bob stoop Lincoln Riley Baker Mayfield sand Bradford I Would present it in much the same way to say hey this is very important to me this is also nice thinning this do you 'cause I don't take it off the shelf for just anybody Hi nice to meet you except in this instance it wasn't a football\nIs a gun so I take the gun because it'd be disrespectful not to be impolite and I hold it for as long as I think I have to mhm right because if things very hot to me in it I I don't I don't like this feeling and I give it back\nRight and we want about the rest of our day that day but I I ask questions after I left right it's not\nIt's not a place where you just get to get up and leave you don't get to act like you know hey what are you doing that's this is wrong you're hitting a black man a gun no no you try to understand you try to an ... an packet you try to stand\nIn what is a scary situation for you so that you can better understand the people in front of you which is totally the premise of my book\nSo Lizzie who is now your ex wife what was your girlfriend at the time she said no no no he was tried was a gesture of friendship\nAnd it's interesting because that like you know her interpreting that for you and it sounds like she was sincere um it's it's almost like when people encounter a culture that they've never met before and some some of the rituals that we haven't experienced ourselves seem bizarre to us but they're meant in friendship\nI I think so you know but also that's part of what was cool about this that I did have heard to ask questions for obvious reasons right and that's also something as crucial to the book is how important it is to have somebody who was within the culture with in\nA for lack of better term the family you know or perhaps even a a club or a tribe that we might use it you know ... from the from the academic sense of a group of people who have the same understanding what customs are to guide you through something you don't know so I Would assume that anybody that\nIs not falling college football needs to know why the college football rankings was such a big deal last night and why it's the only thing that most people in that particular tribe or going to talk about and if you try to walk into it'd be like you know there's no national championship till like January what's the big deal it's it's still October you might get shined\nRight but if you have somebody to walk you through this process you can come to understand you can come to learn and you can come to get to know people that are different than you who believes something that you originally didn't have any use for\nOkay so you decide that you're going to do this you want to get close to your future father in law um teacher now former father in law and and so you decide that you're going to learn to shoot I'm the first time that you went out with him it was awkward\nYeah yeah it was a we were on his property we were on his land um\nEnded up with a safe place to shoot and I had just come away with this this clock is being blocked right Scott twenty six the kind that you use were concealed carry purposes for self defence uh pretty much only you know it's not the kind of person you want to take out to target practice really because you're not gonna do\nMuch were they are also fish in your pocket but that's what I had and I was asking him to help me learn how to use it um it was still something I was very unfamiliar with\nIt was still something that I knew that if I was not reverent about I could not only hurting myself like hurt someone else\nSo we are standing with each other and and are staging area where I had my firearm um was he had her fire and her brother in law my brother in law and his and then Charles had his\nAnd I'm so skittish about how to use this thing that I Want to ask questions but that's not really how Charles is built he wants to see how you react under pressure not yeah do you just you know a plant started she started\nThat that was that was the instruction that I got mhm right so I pointed started shot target\nI damn thing I I didn't hear anything I I I [laughter]\nI felt so terrible because it wasn't that far away you know we're talking about ten yards topic we're talking about first down here right and I I I didn't know what I was doing wrong I I thought I was aiming correctly I thought that I was [laughter]\nPulling the trigger you pull a trigger you know um I Would use my one hand I had bad\nStance I had bad body position I wasn't using my daughter had all these things working against me but I Wish somebody would have just kind of clue me in on but that wasn't the point to point was okay now how are you going to deal with this but crucially\nI thought the gun had jammed right after I shot at just the one time and I didn't know what you do so I still have this gun pointed at target because you don't want to go to anybody ever for any reason except to destroy that person right and I had that in my head I have that real through\nAnd I'm I'm asking for him to help me and he walks up and he takes the gun from me I'm [laughter]\nEach puffs magazine in there because hey it it's sled now 'cause I didn't pop it in there with enough force 'cause I was ... about it then he fired three shots you hit the target and told me after turning the gun sideways don't hold it like this\nYou know in that hit me oh like like you might picture a criminal or um [noise] what some people call a thug in a bad way I'm like like like that was what I was in that moment to him\nAs if that would be the way you'd hold the gun because you are sort of fulfilling his his expectation of what like a gang bangers looks like\nYeah but also as a joke and that's kind of the thing that was really hurtful about is that we still haven't come so far as you didn't know that just wouldn't be funny to me uh-huh you know it it it's that kind of a ...\nIt's the kind of thing which I Would say it's like having to explain to a man why locker room talk he's a bad thing right you're like wait wait backup why is that if they well I thought we understood this I thought you would you would know why to me\nThat would be not only off putting but insulting\nAnd my response was not to quit my response like it is with most things\nIs to become so angry that I Am just going to be the best at this period that's just how it's going to be I Will not let this be my end in more than that I have to be better at this than anybody you know\nIncluding your father in law including my father in law did you tell him have you ever told him that made you angry hurt your feelings\nIn not in as many words we had lots of conversations about race um so many that he would sometimes ask me why everything from back to race and I would say because it does and she you know and that you can impact that and we can be here all day but you know if if\nIf I Am not descended from slaves not may maybe not but I Am if my grandmother didn't lose her business and her livelihood so that I could put a piece of paper into a box\nYeah may maybe but with me yeah it's it's if we're going to have conversations about um inequality in the world and we're going to have a conversation about gun culture we're gonna have to have a conversation about race and come to some fundamental understanding about what that means\nBecause the laws look the same on paper but but in reality it's not the same to be a black person in possession of a weapon that you have legal right to laws\nBy themselves or are awesome I think most people would agree that rules are pretty good who's enforcing the rules are people\nAnd people are different colors they have different backgrounds become different places in the country they were raised about other people mostly like them but some that were not and that's what I wanted to have a conversation about\nMy guest is writer RJ young his book is called let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey and to ... you can join this conversation by calling into one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to find us on Twitter We're at key are eight thank [noise]\n...\nAnd it's not just hand guns it's not just heirlooms it's a are fifteens um it's magazines with people brandishing that holding brandishing firearms um and there's also the the undercurrent of where I was in the world were I mean we're talking about\n... eleven twelve through to twenty sixteen\nI was twenty five when Trayvon Martin was shot and I ... just like he did he was Seventeen we basically look the same the\nBeard I have now I did not have been my hair was cut like is I was clean shaven like like him and he was walking down the street man look one McDonald is a child\nSixteen shots\nFreddie Gray was saying that he couldn't breathe Tamir Rice is well then his front\nLawn all of\nThese ... these men in these children are me in one way shape or form and then you put me in a in a gun show where people are saying\nYou know somebody's got to break into my house somebody's gonna try hurting somebody's gonna try hurting me on the sidewalk and then you couple that with white women in particular clutching their purses I Walk\nNext to them\nKnow I used to think that was just you know me taken offense going okay now I'm Wondering did she actually put her hand on a gun as you walk by ... and if she did did I give her costs like to me\nCheck my actions what was I doing because surely it's not just because I'm black right surely it's not just because they have tattoos I sometimes\nFeel I Need to walk around with my resume tattooed across my\nChest PHD student in uh Eagle Scout I own my own business you know I I never been to prison I've never done drugs [laughter] yeah I I did but but I wanted to do that and that is not what people immediately see\nSo how did you get good at shooting practice I\nMean that's the short answer to practice and but it's not just practice right um I was practicing without construction for quite a while and I got where most people who don't\nGet instruction get ... you know some of us are audited addict digest excuse me I'm just not one of those people but if you give me fundamentals\nI Know how to make my body moving space I played sports growing up I Love football I ran track in college you know I just give me the fundamentals tell me how to do this and I will practice you know that's that's the thing that I knew how to do\nAnd I met a guy who I call wall do in the book because he has this real self reliant streak about him that's something I I kind of in my yard 'cause he as he didn't need to tell you he doesn't need anybody you know you just kind of ...\nAnd he gave me some really great fundamental instruction and he can immediately deduce why I wasn't any good and then he said\nPractice in practice with these things in mind and I did man five days a week one of the gun range I'm\nTrying to just go through the notes that I had taken\nAnd not stopping until I was satisfied that I could do all of this I could I could see for me I could shoot with offhand I could shoot from barrier I can I [noise]\nI scored a perfect hundred\nRight that's in my instructor had told me you know I've only had a couple of people do this the other guy was ex military um how how long you been doing this and that the times about two years and he said really so yeah so like shot everyday mostly\nWell hey man uh that that's not regular said well I I I I Want it's or me or you know\nMe and you know we've been on ... for a while now\n[laughter] this is thank I'm Chris Boyd one thing you learned RJ as you train was that\nMarksman ship is one thing and shooting for self defense is another thing entirely I have to tell you it was not something I never really thought about so we you explain the difference\nYes shooting for Martian ship is a lot like shooting a free throw there is not\nAny pressure that you don't put on yourself on your own time you get to go through your fundamentals check list you get to take you know to dribble that fell on and then do what you do write um it's about patients it's about repetition\nIs about feel\nHey I'm self defense shooting is all reaction is all just practicing these motions\nYou know [laughter] get it out on target fire leave and the leap forward I think people leave off of their their checklist because what I find is most people think that self defense shooting at something like being a cowboy getting outlaw\nYou know we'll have a you know if you come to me ... Dale no self defense shooting is\nCheating yourself out of danger using a firearm for for that get yourself a distance to protect yourself and your family not to kill people but also it's a frame of mind\nMarch ... actual paper [laughter] right right self defense is no if I have to kill somebody I Will\nAnd how ... how many people have already decided that's where I live you know your life is is null and void you break into my house I think about that I think about how many people have already said that to themselves\nYou know and this gets really into an area that makes a lot of people upset when we talk about children\nIf you have children you have an obligation to protect them\nNow ask yourself do you have a ... a a an obligation to kill a person to protect them you might say yes I don't have to answer that question because I don't have children right I live alone\nYou know I get to say my going to stay locked up in a corner you know I don't have any ammunition um if somebody breaks into my house and steals my TV I Choose to believe they need my TV\nNow I'm not saying that I Would just let somebody hurt me no I work out I I take classes you know more ties in my arsenal\nBut I'm not going to kill him there there's there's nothing in my apartment that is we're killing somebody over and there are other people who don't feel that way\nWhy don't you make that decision after you gain the skills to absolutely be able to kill someone if they threatened to\nTwo reasons\nFirst one is my grandmother didn't need to do that and there's a chapter in this book called grand mommy this book is dedicated to grandma me um she passed in January so it's very big deal to me and her birthday was October twenty nice couple days ago but\nGrandmother is civil rights royalty especially in Mississippi she ... she sued the governor for voting reinforcement writes in one\nShe challenged repeatedly for the right to vote the right to vote and she did it non violently so much so that they're just really awesome story that you know daily depart at large ... he's also civil rights royalty and this is an oral history\nThere was this sweet old lady named ... my grandmother\nWho went to Nineteen sixty four with Fannie Lou Hamer that don't get to challenge her seat didn't like what they got got on a bus to go home from Atlantic City and there's a crowd of angry white folks that were stopping the bus and to lead D I tell it my grandmother to get her kitchen knife\nAnd put it to the bus drivers head instead of this stuff your head comes off\nI got to ask my grandmother about that story as I was writing the book because I'm like that's that's awesome story and my great grandmother's bed at like that's where I was with that and she was irritated by it\nShe was so irritated by that she said one never happen to people mythology as all the time and three\nI'd never get anything done with guns and knives baby and that does not mean that I was not angry that's not what that means it means if you're going to ask people to change their behavior\nYou cannot do it\nAt the end of a weapon you have to do it with a hug\nMy guest is writer RJ young his new memoir is called let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns looking back to the conversation in a couple of minutes if you'd like to join us you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to\n...
