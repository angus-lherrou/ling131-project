it'd be cutting the trade war can find these investors and to find a section of\nKaty at work or wherever\n\nAbout ... ... is an amazing what you think is the arteries aren't really an enormously charming I go with your heart and we don't have any idea why those those are the things\nThe ways that we talk about things become the ways that we think about how do I marked mark and I'm Rebecca ... and this these two guys and you had today metaphor in framing disclosed [noise]\nThere was an interesting op ed piece a in New York Times this morning\nWhere the ... the notion of the resistance a came up you know the hash tag ... resist a that was developed about\n... months ago yeah ... exactly and and and the and this and this writer you raise the question which is an interesting question\nWell are the people who are calling themselves the resistance actually the resistance or is what's happening now with the people in power or the day the resistance of an inevitable change that's taking place in the country and in society that those people are trying to resist\n... and I it really was interesting to think about how much we envision ourselves by the metaphors we use to describe our motivations are our actions are beliefs\nAnd when when we think about things like you know how do you define yourself are you a part of what's holding something back are you part of what's pushing something forward and that kind of metaphorical language influences the way we make decisions about how\nTo act yeah and and so I think what's important about this has to recognize a not so much the current political environment but but the influence that that particular metaphor has on the options that you think are available to you\nSo um if we take the notion of resistance for example so resistance assumes if you just think about uh about about the concept of resistance in general\nThat there's some force that's moving in a particular direction and the thing that is resisting that force is impeding the motion of that in some way and so\nWhen you cast\nYour yourself as a member of a resistance now what you're saying is there is some force in the world often a social force of some time perhaps the government perhaps it's the uh some other social movement\nAnd and it is ... the assumption is that it is driving the the uh it is the engine of change\nAnd by being a resistance to that it is your job to stop that change well what is that what does that influence in terms of the actions you're willing to take well it suggests that someone else is setting the agenda\nAnd that your job is to word that agenda\nThat the most obvious statement for you to make at any given moment is no and uh and and that that your job is not constructive but destructive in the sense of trying to dismantle\nThe the apparatus that is creating the force that moving against him and and so that in ... the importance of that analysis is that if you recast the kind of metaphor that you use\nYou may then recognize that there are other options at your disposal at that moment that might enable a very different set of actions are very different approach to the very ... it's a great point yeah\nYeah and and I I think all of us if we think about our own self concept I mean what we imagine ourselves as being you know or are we the person who's ... who's facilitating something that we the people who's keeping something bad from happening those kinds of things\nI think art makes a really important point about what kind of options for action or inaction a are available to us based on that definition and it is interesting to consider how much\nJust a word or two can actually to find so much about the situation precisely\nFor the reason that we use metaphors to begin with right they they have a lot of meaning packed into them already and then when we signed them to some other thing that they've not yet been associated with all those meanings come along for the ride right so when we think about\nResistance as art just beautifully explained as something that's now stopping or at least slowing some moving force that already has some momentum but that's one way of thinking about things but what what to me has been such an interesting thing to observe about the way we human beings use language\nIs it not only reflects what we already think\nBut changing our language in a deliberate way can actually change the way we think because of all of those definitions that the words we use metaphorically carry with them and I and I many of this much of this is probably unwitting on on most people's parts most of the time\nBut it's certainly can be mustard and in a purposeful way to actually bring about changes of thinking and ultimately changes in people's\nWhen a particular group uses a particular way of describing a situation because those words create a social reality they also bind together the members\nOf that community who then recognize fellow members of that community by the use of a common language\nTo the extent though that that that that language is language that other people also find expressive for things that they're experiencing which may be very different from what the first community experiencing they may choose to use that same language and that can create a tremendous amount\nTension because now you have a community does is wait a second we meant a particular thing\nBy what we were saying and you you shouldn't be using our language because you're you're a member of a different group and now you're\n... you know it almost be like if suddenly one football team adopted the jurors use of the other team because you can't do that we can now we can't tell her we can't tell ourselves apart anymore and by dressing up your\nWhat you're saying in the same language that someone else using it can be very disconcerting in ways that may ultimately the initial group to stop using that language because now they feel like those words no longer express the concept that they intended\nThere are people who will deliberately try to do take language and some verdict meaning you as a way of trying to take the teeth out of what someone else is doing\nYou know I think it's easy to to Penn nefarious motives on on others and sometimes that is undoubtedly true that people do things in order to mess with you but I also think that there are plenty of times\nIn which people are are doing things\nFrom heartfelt on their own terms that still may wrangle you\nLose next week we'll talk about why\nWe crave sugar Dr art magnet and talked about David ... Jake Perlman and Michael Crawford are aren't engineers I'm Rebecca mcenroe and it produced you guys on your head at K. U. T. radium\nIn Austin, Texas\nComing on the Internet 'cause he's a brand that the cactus cafe this Tuesday at six it's all you need to know about the mid term Hi I'm Rebecca neck and joined guess has Katie's ... along with political analysts Matthew down Texas Tribune editor in chief Emily ... and Katie's senior reporter Audrey ...\nTo talk about the border wall public school funding affordable housing and much more\nThese improved is free end up into the public we have to see this Tuesday at six at the campus find more details that cactus cafe dot org [noise]\nThis is often NPR station K. U. T. K. E. T. H. T. one often and on line to K. U. T. dot org community supported public radio from UT Austin up next to thank Jimmi months is going to take it to the program [noise]\nI'm Chris Boyd next on think an image makeover for the bond everybody loves to hate it's true that termites make unwelcome house guests what with some species taste for blood and all\nBut why don't we ... explain the termites are a critical part of many ecosystems where the metabolism that can hold the key to cheap biofuels\nAnd termites extraordinary form of collective intelligence to kind of mine shared by thousands of individuals in a single mound think carefully studied by military scientists were modest dissent computer programmers conversation started after a short break [noise]\nUm [noise]\n\nWell you did this very soon after this landmark study that conclusively demonstrated termites are genetically linked to cock roaches which are fully I think for most people is like strike to catch them your eye but how did they diverge from from their cousins the cockroaches\nWill back you know a hundred and fifty million years ago [noise] um [noise] there were cockroaches are solitary bugs they don't live in what some of them eventually lived in kind of communities but they they're basically solitary and they don't raise their young they just kind of leaving eggs somewhere and that needs to raise itself so um they\n... what happened was some\nCock roaches started living inside would or start eating would and wait for them to eat the wood\nAnd digest it was to have some microbes so they picked up some microbes in the in the environment than they were able to eat wood but the problem is cockroaches shed their intestines they ... their intestines like every ... pretty frequently so yeah so that would clean out all their good microbes excuse me I have a cold I'm\nSo they would clean out all the good microbes and so what they started doing was somehow they started sharing what's called ...\nWhich is basically there to ... up from eating from each other's guts butts and sharing from the mouse and it was just it's quite a scene in my mouth [laughter]\nUh [laughter] and um so then they somehow the genes either there's the behavior change and then there was the genetic changes we don't know which came first they somehow they began to sort of pull their reproduction they pulled their digestion\nThey started to communicate\nWith each other through through um pheromones and hormones um and and they all sort of became social and that that happened before the ants in the wasps and the other social insects that we know now um and it evolved separately so it was kind of amazing\nSo the queen of a termite colonies so physically different from the others around it and she seems like a different animals so so tell us a little bit about termites queens I Know there are a lot of species so you'll have to generalize but for us\nYeah [laughter] um well the termite queen that it can be very hard to find a tour my queen you know if you're if you've got termites in your house you could dig for a long time and not find a term my queen and\nSome exterminators really haven't seen very many of them but there is I I went to a Namibia in Africa and visited some big macro term mountains which are like the Fifteen foot high mountains that they have there\nAnd um we're able to pop out the queen and\nThe queen is about the size of my anger she's big wow and the other termites are you know they're really about the size of of the end of my finger nail I mean they're very tiny and very very slight so the difference is just enormous um\nThe queen's are so alter my colonies have some they have babies that are fertile\nAnd those that are not and the the ones that are marked for fertility develop differently they have wings they have eyes and usually on a damn night they'll come out the burst out of the side of the mound and fly a little bit on those wings and then they break them off\nAnd they pair up with some other termite and they go off and try to start a new colony most of them get eaten there apparently really delicious but um [noise] [laughter]\nThat's a side to side [laughter] so um [laughter] they ah [noise] then then in their little hole they um after they've broken off their wings\nThey mate and then they also bite off the end of their antennas which I think it's just amazing because that means that that limits the amount of sensory information that they are getting\nThey're going to spend if they're ... they're going to spend the next maybe Fifteen or Twenty years holed up in a dark hole with five million of their\nChildren [laughter] you know sort of turn down the sensory and for me\nShouldn't and I'm In the end they bitten off the end of those those um intended so\nUm then the queen begins to swell as she has more and more eggs she puts out an egg like every three seconds or something like that for years round the clock wow and she begins to swell so that she really can't move\nAnd she becomes she looks kind of like um [noise] um I don't know like a really badly tied homemade\nSausage means you it's really they're really weird looking and you can see through their ... their skin or in their exoskeleton is is translucent so you see this sort of swirling like coffee with cream added to it think actually just looking at a termite queen sort of makes you feel nauseous and weird\nUm [noise] and ah and she is weird\n[laughter] and\nAnd the other thing about turning queens is it's not just that they have five million or nine million children\nIt's that they can reproduce carcinogenic Lee without without the mail they can produce eggs that don't have holes to get a for the sperm to come in so they can produce eggs that that just developed into new queen termites so they in some ways you know they can live kinda forever\nAnd there are some termite colonies that are headed by two kings so how does that work\n[laughter] don't ask me [laughter] you know there's a\nTremendous variety of ways for termite colonies to work and uh you know you probably heard in the news that there's a new group of or not a new group it's an old group of termites um that have been discovered in\nRediscovered in Japan who don't seem to have any males at all huh I'm they seem to be entirely um you know entirely female\nSo um that's something new but there's basically there's often something new under the sun with termites partly because they are just kind of under studied and so much of this study is about how to kill them yeah but I'm the but partly also because they are like\nThey are just crazy sort of genetic adaptive powerhouses like they they've got it figured out they know how to live on her\nUm and and they know how to survive so uh that's part of what makes them so wonderful to look at it is because they kind of give you a picture of what it takes to survive on this planet\nHow termites individual termites get their instructions for what their job will be\n... [laughter] well that's a several billion dollar question [laughter] um [laughter] we don't know\nUm sometimes they get it from the environment to one of their the instructions that they get is they get pheromones that are emitted by the queen\nUm and those instructions held don't keep their um development suppressed so the workers and the soldiers are actually sort of children or or maybe they're pre teens like they're they're not they don't develop fully I'm so they're developments suppressed um some of them will be it\nSeemed to eat special secretion from the butts of the king and the queen and does tend to differentiate into soldiers\nAnd the soldiers have 'em they often have big heads\nA really special big heads or some of them have had that are shaped like a plug so they can like block anybody who's attacking them from coming in they can just a block the tunnels basically by sticking their headed um but some of them have novels that spray like a turban time like substance\nOn to anybody who's attacking and um some of them lots of them have these wild mandibles that snap and different\nFabulous ways um so uh that's they differentiate into the soldiers in the soldiers also have to be fed by the worker so\nYou you have to have a pretty big calling you to start having soldiers and then we don't know how the workers get their signal some of it they get from saliva from other termites some of it they get from sounds termites seemed to communicate through sound a lot they do this clicking sound\nUm they also a termites a really sensitive to shift in the gas composition around them so if there's a fresh\nOr if there's a hole somewhere in the mound there's some fresh air coming in they'll run towards that whole they'll run towards the fresh air to try to block it um\nBut uh it's only recently become clear that ... memories huh well they don't necessarily need\nA lot of individual memory to get done what they need to get done right\nWell that's a good question I mean when you look at these mountains in that are like Fifteen feet high or or Seventy feet high in Africa\nUm [noise] it's kind of how could you even think about this but on the ... you know it's hard to come up with a master plan that would result in this mound they're very sophisticated um but then when you look at what they build it out of out of individual mouth full of mud\nAnd it it's it's really extraordinary and you do sort of wonder what drives them and and how they conceive of it if if at all\nMy guests to journalists Lisa market Nelly her book is called under bug and obsessive tale of termites and technology will come back to the conversation in a couple of minutes if you want to join us you can call in to one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think K. E. R. A. dot org or go to Twitter We're at K. E. R. A. thank [noise]\nOh [noise]\nWe would never get the virus on our computer [laughter] so it's very attractive but you know there's other things like routing phone calls or even moving traffic you know changing traffic dynamic so that you don't have traffic jams all these sorts of things could potentially be influenced by technology that you could get modeled on tour my\nSon said go ahead really hard to figure that reminded doing [laughter]\nI was just like some ah some computer science are hoping to construct thousands of like teeny tiny robots that could be turned collectively into whatever shape or tool might be necessary in a challenging environment\nOr what is the least you can spend to build one of these teeny tiny robot prototypes that could theoretically be um be given a tour might like intelligence\nOh I was high we're nowhere near close to it however um I followed a group of scientists from Harvard's vis Institute\nA and they were led by a woman named Brad can knock Paul and\nUm they managed to build a thousand term I I Know a thousand little robots and they were each about uh ten dollars each and their their goofy little robots they basically have vibe raiders on them um and and they looked like a little puck a like a little hockey puck up on\nSort of wire legs and when you turn one vibrate or on they go in one direction we turn the other vibrate or on they sort of they swing in a different way so you can kind of change how the vibe writers worked to make them go\nWe're going backwards and stuff like that um and they have a couple of other basic little sensors and they can sort of collectively do things like form the shape of starfish ... without without anybody ... I mean they of course they get their information they get instructions from\nA computer but they the the start the robots and self assemble themselves following kind of a set of rules an algorithm um which is kind of like a flow chart and so they they basically they follow the steps and eventually uh starfish pattern emerges out of them\nSo any individual robot says if if I'm In these conditions I Do this if the conditions are different in this way I Do that instead exactly huh All right I Want to go to the phones our number is one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to ... you can also reach us on Twitter at K. E. R. A. think let's go to Leslie in Garland Hi Lesley\n[laughter] Hi are doing very well thanks that it's very interesting program oh my goodness term I Can't even imagine [laughter] I'm like I'm ... I was curious I'm\nAt one point my husband and I were renting a little house\nIn another city and there and the problem with carpenter and they were like ... and they can they they're all inside the war I'm itching the spray like the area where you saw than what the next morning the harm that every day and night there were like\nTermites media coverage kind of writing that don't work that way they the landlord came out and they they had people treat it and they went away that um somebody told me that that car insurance you're not a war but I wondered if there were any genetic relationship between the chase a shady\nThat that your guests might yeah no it has to take my answer off the air thank\nYou thanks for calling you about that Lisa that's a great question I'm actually they're not related at all a carpenter ants are completely a different a whole different evolutionary set of of of things that happened\nA than termites and carpenter ... I I have also heard that they don't actually eat the word they just chew through it and nest in it I don't know whether that's true um\n[noise] I also was infested by carpenter ants in and it's it's really nuts [laughter]\nIt's horrible and you and you don't know what you're going to do with it is definitely cone exterminator time\nMy guest is journalists Lisa market Nelly her book is under bug and obsessive tale of termites in technology you're listening to think I'm Chris Boyd [noise]\nUm what what counts for the fact that although like bees can cause a nuisance for humans ants can cause a nuisance for humans we are kind of fascinated by those social insects why are people almost universally bothered by the existence of termites\nWell they eat her husband [laughter] there's not much worse job right most of them most of them don't but we don't know about the ones that don't you know the\nThe the desert in in Texas has actually filled with termites um they're all around you and they're not actually eating your house or only some of them are eating out\nUm the other thing too is that the the termites they do eat houses are particularly well adapted to humans and human disturbance they um\n[noise] you know they they like disturbed landscape stay like are are the material that our houses are made of a and um they are also if they've been moved around through our wars and other things like that whenever we do shipping with a wooden pallets has\nUm you run the chance of bringing termites in so\nUm so you know they're kind of a related to us in in in a funny way there's um two species of termites that are injured breeding hybrid ... in a in the south eastern part of the U.S and they're forming sort of they were they were terrible before um but they're forming sort of super colonies that are super termites\nUm and that's a you know these things are scary uh justifiably scary and um [noise]\nAnd so that's we don't we don't know very much about the uh the so called good termites um and uh I guess they've ... you know as you said they've had some bad PR [laughter]\nWhat do I mean when they're far away from our houses and all the things that we own and value um what's their function in the ecosystem\nWell they are the ones who take all the dead stuff and turn it into sort of fertilizer in the soil\nAh and they build in many cases concentrations of fertility so um if you if you think about looking out over a whole dry landscape um you you'll find these tough it out of grass and trees\nAnd some of those in in certain parts of the world those are actually sort of formed by termites who are working underneath they gather the dead grass in the landscape and they pull it back to the mound they digest it whether with their guts or with their ... their fungus and then they sort of spread their feces through through the ground\nUm they also changed the way the water works in the ground that way\nUm and the combination of the two their feces contain extra nitrogen so it's basically like a fertilizer and that makes this sort of explosion of grasses and trees and even spiders and geckos and everything else on top\nAnd so they they create a sort of grids of fertility in huge huge areas of of Africa and Asia\nAre probably also in South America as well probably across the U.S desert it's just that oftentimes it's hard to see that um some some termite scientists studied in the desert in um\nA New Mexico I think that the termites we're moving something like um five hundred pounds of dirt a year per ten acre plot wow so they're actually you know they're they're readjusting the dirt like grain by grain which is something that humans could never do I mean the best we can do is kind of a big plow\nPart let's go back to the phones um we have Robert on the line in Austin Hi Robert\nI ... I think you we thank you for calling\nSo you mentioned earlier that supposedly try our case I Know that all around the world to provide a even a delicate you either research that you're describing to try to have your potentially lead to new animal husbandry practices that could have actually allow or Troy arming for security or\nEven if ... if not that secure it to create tacos eat chicken\nThanks for calling when you know by thank you um [noise] I don't know anyone who is working on breeding more termites [laughter] just say [laughter] um for the purposes of human eating them they are really popular in some parts of the world people will pan fry them\nUm the the ones that people eat or not the workers and the soldiers who are kind of desiccated and crunchy or what they're eating is the um [noise] the kings and the queens the fertile fertile termites that have wings on them and I've eaten them they're kind of delicious All right\nWe set market alley is I guess she's a journalist his new book is called under bug an obsessive tale of termites and technology joined us that eight hundred nine three three five three seven to email think K.
