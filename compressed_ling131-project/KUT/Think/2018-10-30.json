[laughter] that's what the cancer for yeah no I'm Sorry yeah that's a really quick question there to leave you can buy cut up\n... pumpkin pie says you can but you know cut out anything right now you know I see that and I'm like look how dry out and sort of shriveled that is\nSee by small pumpkin like two pounds three pounds you deal with it the way you would deal with the winter squash which is what it is\nThe easiest way to do it is to cut in half\nPull out all those seats in the stringy fleshy part keep the seeds those are quite at a ball and the fall of fiber and delicious\nUm and then I just use a regular vegetable peeler and peel off the outside cut the pumpkin into chunks and you're good to go the other way to do it is to cut it in half roast the pumpkin flesh side down in a three hundred and fifty degree oven for a little bit less than an hour scrape the flesh out throw it in a food processor and you have something\nFar more flavorful than the canned pumpkin I've already started signed that letter words just because you had this soup to start now to this has got to come in and leaks soup\nAnd on top of it are fried siege leaves stage and pumpkin go really beautifully together this is an adaptation of a recipe from my book soup swab and this used a three pound sugar pumpkin some leaks a little bit of olive oil fresh time and sage\nAnd you just hook it up and vegetables stock or chicken stock puree it and then to make fried stage leaves which sounds like you know restaurant food but it's not you just heat up like less than a cup of canola oil or a little olive oil throw the wholesale usually than sprinkle it with core sea salt and then\nI Can't imagine that saves lives fried sage leaves are going to become the next friday in Brussels sprouts let's\nSay you should say okay and you're right that I didn't hear\nThe case that it gives it's like you know for those I mean if they don't want they can ... that is he'll\nEventually they're really good point and it also at the wonderful texture to appear eight soup something I'm always thinking about I also took the seeds out of the pumpkin\nPut them in the oven with a bit of olive oil and sea salt\nAnd sprinkled a few pumpkin seeds into your soup you also made a ... I did something in ... yes and again you can use regular old squashed but the pumpkin is far sweeter so there's chunks of pumpkin and there there's are boerio rice which is the special Italian rice it specifically use for Rizzo do\nBecause it maintains its texture\nThere's good parmesan cheese and there were so does this time of year is might go to comfort food and with the little sweet pumpkin\n... other thing I Want to point out its don't think about pumpkins as only being affiliated with this Halloween which will be over tomorrow this is great well these are the rest of the year I don't know why do I take a break the law and eat pumpkins for the next [laughter]\nWhat did we get here this looks like a desert a third thing because we had to do a desert and I have to admit it I Am not a huge fan of pumpkin pie this is the pumpkin putting and if you did all the way to the bottom you will find there's a ginger snaps crust\nSo there is a bit of a snappy injury crust on the bottom and then the pumpkin putting is simply eggs okay here's my great\nGreat thing I'm going to admit to I used organic cat and I was going to ask and yeah I did because I thought let's give it a try and I did find inorganic variety and I think it tastes great and there's sentiment in there and ginger and all spice and then I added a little bit of whipped cream and some crystallized ginger\nAnd I would just say I'm for those of us who oh well let's just say I once had what we refer to as the great butternut squash incident of I think it was two thousand something in which I was cutting you know they get such smooth skin and I was saying to someone oh no I should do this with a very sharp knife and it then I slipped and that kind of editing that\nAnd then you want to be careful when he's the skin on some of these pumpkins are quite tough but it's really not difficult to do and if you use a wide peeler you're going to be all set\nOff or if you have one cutting board that is just this kind of thing you put some on a way over itself underneath or nails out from underneath and you ... pale the court on the nails and\nJust keep talking about well the pumpkin pie\nWe'd like to turn now [laughter] we got all these recipes website here now dot org as always Kathy happy Halloween and thank you and\nWe go for the ... over the candy [laughter] it's an adult Mac and cheese for\nThe production of NPR WNPR in association with the b._b._c.

I Am a development and then you have a feeling nervous [laughter]\nAnd I love listening to radio but I Do not mind being on the hates a strong word but you know I'm not totally comfortable doing that I Am definitely want to get in my mind so that I think all of you\nIs the only thing that would get me in the studio to say thank you to our number we really appreciate the ...\n[noise]\nI'm Chris Boyd up next something before you post another photo or click and other news story what you need to know about Facebook\nCompany has earn billions of dollars collecting and selling user data to just about anybody willing to pay for\nAdvertisers ethnical offered is like and its algorithms helps fake news stories go viral even when they were known to be like that story about the pope endorsing Donald Trump than twenty six team that was they talk about how Facebook was used to foment\nRevolution during the Arab Spring to turn Ukrainian citizens against their own government in favor of letting me and to throw gasoline on divisions between America's political parties\nNot to mention selling more information about individual users\nAnd most of those users thought our conversation starts after a short break and ... [noise]\nAnd so it was this incredible growth but at the same time they weren't staffing up to meet\nAll the sorts of demands that would happen in terms of what content can be moderated and taking down bad content or addressing problems that what a rise in the Facebook world um and in some cases translate from Facebook rolled into the real world\nAnd so we we speak to a woman named Elizabeth Linder who was\nEarly on at the company and actually was in a which she described as an ... role\nWhere she was based in Europe the middle east and Africa essentially is Facebook's representative\nAnd seen firsthand I'm all over the region how Facebook was changing societies and changing things for for good and for bad\nBut um being in Menlo Park California that's where the headquarters is a lot of the people that were there she says we're not really paying attention to what was going on in the real world especially in places\nWhere they've expanded and they really didn't have the staff to be able to understand local nuances and local conflicts and I don't think they really had an interest in staff enough to do so\nEven when you talk about somebody based in Europe the middle east and Africa that isn't dozens of vastly different society\nAbsolutely and um and I think Elizabeth lender or recognize the difficulty of her role um and worked tirelessly to meet with activist groups and government groups and try to get people to understand\nWhat this platform was was doing and what they aimed to do but I think it was an overwhelming challenge and um and what's interesting is is is she would say that there wasn't the early on there was a decision made at headquarters to not really want to take responsibility\nFor either the good or the bad that was happening because once you do take responsibility to the question is for what's happening on Facebook the question is what do you do that um if you're responsible for all the content that\nAll of a sudden tens if not hundreds and billions of people are sharing on a platform on any given debt\nSo it's hard for us to remember what any site that we use daily was like before it changed but um [noise] talk a little bit about how Facebook started experimenting with ways to keep users on the site longer and then they came up with this thing they called news feed\nYes so very key thing about Facebook is um is the word engagement and engagement is is key and what it really means is basically engaging users so that they spend more time on Facebook\nSo essentially they can feed you more content and feed you more ads and the idea is um you know the more time on site which is how they measure engagement in some ways is the most important\nMetric for the company or had been in its in its early years and so they needed to develop products that kept people there and kept people scrolling and clicking and liking and sharing and commenting and so there was this invention and um [noise] I think he was in two thousand seven of the news feed\nAnd news feed is essentially your\nAs one person in the film puts it your optimize view of the world at your your personal New York times the New York times have you essentially where the computer algorithms taking all the information that's on Facebook that friends are sharing that news organizations are sharing that others are sharing\nAnd feeding you what it thinks you want based on what you've clicked on for things that you've liked things that you haven't liked things that you shared\n[noise] what is the downside of any of us getting only information that we find appealing\n... well it's a it's a very important question when it comes to Facebook um because it can certainly flatter your world view of one person put it to me it can it can create what are called filter bubbles or preference bubbles I'm wary if this is your primary\nFor a source of news and information which it is for lots of Americans and certainly internationally for lots of people then I'm you're getting things that essentially um are not necessarily contradicting your world view because the algorithm is giving you things that it thinks you're most likely to engage with\nI mean the company disagrees with that point they've they've they've they cite research on occasion\nThat says that they're not reading filtered bubbles but we heard from too many people but it worked inside the company that that really it is what I mean in essence the news feed is a filter bubble its its filtering information for you designed for you and I think\nThat the societal effects of it have been\nQuite remarkable um in that you\nAre you're flattering your world view and operating in these bubbles are echo chambers can lead to your kind of closing off from alternative opinions um and also starting to believe things inside that echo chamber that might not necessarily be true\nSo it's one thing to create those personalize feeds based on um things that we have posted on our own pages or things that we have click through and then she sounds in nine somebody came up with the like button which was like the mother of all I'm Dale resources for ...\nYes it was a I mean it it's an ingenious invention like button right I mean what it did um is it it was a an engagement gold mine for them because it's an easy way to get people to engage with content um and\nSo it's also a terrific way to understand people's preferences are predilection or what they like and so they're constantly gathering more information about you as the user in order to give you more of what you like and also to tailor advertising which is how they make their money\nI'm Taylor advertising or target you with advertising that might interest you\nAnd so it's it's also just to you know just psychologically a fascinating thing with the like button has done and did do and how they thought about it in terms of\nYou know the validation when you post something than if you get validation if you get lax and you're going to post war and you're going to spend more time on site and now with Instagram which is also on Facebook\nUm it's really a light machine I mean you're you're ... you're not even necessarily reading anything you're just looking at people's pictures and you're like in them\n[noise] what sort of rules did Facebook established for content that wouldn't be allowed I mean to my knowledge you can't get like pornography um what else is not allowed\nRight pornography nudity hum incitement to violence which is considered hates each um but very early on the ... we we we feature an interview with a guy named ...\nWho was a tub of policy director in Facebook's early years when they ... they were coming up with what they consider to be the constitution for this burgeoning digital nation state\nAnd they needed to come up with the basic rules of the road for what was acceptable intolerable inside that space of Facebook and what wasn't and\nAs he put it that they took a very libertarian hands off approach because they considered it at the time and it's actually true to be the largest experiment and free speech and human history [noise] um and\nThe it was a it was a very thoughtful and considered approach of taking that libertarian approach because these were truly advocate for\nFree speech and First Amendment rights and um that's obviously a very powerful thing and tool ... around the world in places where there aren't First Amendment rights so they felt like\nThey want it to enable people to say things all the way up to a line of incitement to violence and hate speech um and then ban certain things for you know kind of community standards like\nUm you know a really illicit activity or and things like that um the thing is is that they didn't\nNecessarily as what they didn't have the resources to basically police um the site and deal with all the complaints that came in and\nObviously in some ways that that experiment has gone awry because what do you do about the ability of rumors to spread misinformation to spread or bad actors that intentionally or spreading disinformation and these are things that actually started to pop up early on in the company's history\nBut because of that libertarian approach um they didn't really address those issues proactively\n[noise] yeah they were sort of relying on what they called that the basic decency of most people and and I think that's true but we're about to take a break here but when we come back we'll talk about the fact that he really only takes a very small number of bad actors to get a great deal of bad information out on the site\nYes um that that's absolutely true and I think I'm there is a logic though to what they wanted to do and not opposed to many rules um the thing is that they what they're doing now to amp up safety and security in moderation of content just some and they um they probably should have done much earlier\nI guess it's frontline correspondent James Jacoby he directed and reported the two nights special frontline documentary the Facebook dilemma\nOne aired last night on PBS stations across the country part she will be on tonight I Believe you can catch those hours on line after it has aired in its entirety if you'd like to join our conversation you can call eight hundred Ninety three three five three seven to or you can find us on Twitter at ... are a thing [noise]\nOoh [noise]\nSupport comes from tours academy who knows puppy love often comes with a few less than lovable behaviors stores is here to help with training boarding a daycare inside of convenient location learned more tourists academy dot com [noise]\nIs anybody to your knowledge it doesn't come up in the film but um if anybody the FTC talking about how impenetrable um those disclosure forms are that we have on every website we encounter I think almost everybody disclose to the bottom it's okay if they want to use the site but not fully understanding what they've just given permission for\nYes um I you know I'm not sure what whether the FTC is is engaged in anything about terms and conditions and um Europe certainly is I think that the\nThe they've just passed a major privacy law in Europe that's gone into effect in may [noise] um and it's a data privacy law so these companies are really starting to ramp up what they're trying to disclose to people and are obligated to\nBut um it's really falls on the consumer to read the terms and conditions and it and in in because of the lack of any\nOn the bus privacy laws in this country um ... the terms and conditions are really basically\nWhatever these companies want to do um as long as they're not deceiving you about what they're doing\nSo it's not that it's technically difficult or impossible to adjust privacy controls because it's been done for Facebook users in Europe but that equivalent laws don't exist in much of the United states\nThat's correct yeah I mean that the equivalent\nThere is no restriction on a ... to ... I I don't believe there's any restriction on their collection of data\nAnd then basically what they have to do if they're sharing that day to day don't sell data Facebook doesn't sell it state of but they have shared it\nWith for instance that's what got them into trouble with Cambridge Analytica and they shared it with you know game developers an app developers and other people that were building things that would drive to fly we'll of engagement on Facebook and keep people there they share user data with them um and\nThat ah that was what got them in trouble with the FTC back in two thousand eleven and may get them in trouble based on what's happened since\nIt really stunned me to learn that Facebook doesn't place or has placed restrictions on the way these third party developers to use the information being share but\n... they've placed um they've played some restrictions but they really didn't do much due diligence and um and in terms of enforcing those restrictions on either legally or otherwise are investigating how this data was being used and\nI mean one one person I spoke to that didn't make it in the in the documentary had worked on the Obama campaign in two thousand twelve as a major person in the digital um campaign and had had they the Obama campaign at that point in time and created an app\nUm that enabled them to fund raise and target people on Facebook and they were given these huge data sets and when I asked this woman Carol Davidson about you know this is you know tens of millions of people's data\nUm did anyone deleted does anyone know where it was cut it and ended up on a thumb drive and she said yeah the ... this was completely fungible there was no water marking there was no real effort or questions by Facebook after having given their huge swaths of data away\nAbout what was happening to it and not um that's what eventually\nGot caught them in a in in in deep trouble with Cambridge Analytica scandal\nOkay before we get to Cambridge Analytica and there is an organization based in St Petersburg Russia with the the name interest Internet research agency which honestly the name suggests like a sleepy little think tank with for employees it it's actually a troll farm what what kind of activity was this group engaged in on Facebook\nSo they were engaged in um [noise] basically propaganda they were it was it ... it was a propaganda factory that has links to the Kremlin that was started by a very wealthy Russian who is part of the ... inner circle and essentially\nIt was a propaganda factory um mostly young men and women in their twenties who um did anything from ... in fake news articles that they would then disseminate on\nFake accounts on social media wasn't just stays book I was a major Russian site called decay um there's other sites that they were using they were creating Twitter accounts as well but Facebook was certainly one of them and they basically cede\nThe social media sites with with pro Russian propaganda and they also be much more proactive\nIn terms of trying to undermine other places like the neighboring Ukraine um which they were already involved in what was has been called a hybrid or you know both troops on the ground and as well as\nOne of the most sophisticated information war is ever fought in which they were\nBasically setting up these fake accounts and disseminating all uh all sorts of fake stories in Ukraine about ah in order to sow distrust and toward the new Ukrainian government there and pro Russian sentiment\nJust this thing I'm crystal Wade did Facebook make any changes to its business model when he realized what the Internet research agency and and presumably other organizations were dealing\nNo they didn't um they they actually didn't see that as a threat um in part I I I you know I've gleaned from a lot of interviews that\nThere wasn't that much attention paid to how the platform was being used abroad especially in places like Ukraine which is a small market and otherwise I kind of back water to the executives and in Menlo Park the real growth and dollars come from the United states in from Western Europe\nSo if there was something like that going on in Ukraine they didn't see it as a security threat either um because this was just content and given what we're talking about earlier in terms of being a free speech platform people are free to post what they want\n'em and they were warned about this uh according to a very senior advisor to the Ukrainian President um who also happened to have been a senior executive at Microsoft in Ukraine\nAnd um and they saw it as a free speech issue they really didn't see it as a a threat to security\nSo in part two of the doc which airs tonight on PBS stations um you drill down to the real history of\nFake news not in the sense that President Trump tends to define the term but [noise] um can you talk about how is down in Macedonia became like the world capital of fake news initially generated simply for profit right\nYes correct um so so fake news actually was a is is was coined the term um by Craig Silverman who is a writer for and reporter for ... feed 'em and he\nHe and back in twenty fourteen actually as part of a project at the Columbia Journalism school I've been studying rumors and lives on social media and how they go viral\nAnd she started to coin some of these some of these articles that we're going viral at the time as early as twenty fourteen of fake news they were simply written in the journalistic style um to look like articles that to to be ... to look like any journalism outfit or news outlet and\nI'm essentially tried to create click bait you know very incendiary headlines in order for people to click there and then they could sell ads\nTo advertisers on their site and it was there was a small town in Macedonia where he dug up all this information about all these pro Trump stories and anti Hillary stories and at the time in the twenty sixteen election\nThat we're getting a tremendous amount of gauge engagement at the time making these people a lot of money but we're also completely false um and Craig Silverman was writing about that during the twenty sixteen election\nAnd then most polarizing the stakes stories would be shared typically vastly more often than stories like credible major news organization\nYeah I mean Silverman a cite the example that some of these you know headlines some of which most listeners will remember like the port pope endorsing Trump or\nHillary Clinton's ISIS collection a connections or buying arms from my sister was telling her I mean completely apocryphal story is getting more engagement on Facebook then\nWhen the New York times had a scoop about Donald Trump's tax returns 'em and had been obtained as it is tax returns from\nUh the mid nineties and so you Silverman ask the question you know what what what what kind of information system if we created where these things go viral um compared to a highly reported reputable articles\nJames Jacoby is my guest is a frontline correspondent and director he was responsible is responsible for these special tonight frontline documentary Facebook
