U. T. K. to Steven Austin on line to Casey towering\nI'm Chris boy I think something what the constitution\nSays about presidential impeach Smith and why the our former presidents removal\nFrom office between election cycles is so\nWe'll send this hour with Jeffrey angle of SMU Center for presidential history new was it was a framer is meant by high crimes and misdemeanors\nAnd why they were only worried about a commander in chief working against the American people for money or at the direction of a foreign power we'll talk about impeachment proceedings brought against Andrew Johnson Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton\nAnd how each outcome was shaped by evidence political climate and popular opinion our conversation starts after a short break\n... [noise]\n\nOr a subjective reason well that essentially mixed that person's subservient to the higher authority\nSo policymakers and today the architects of the constitution really wrestled quite different ... quite were great difficulty over how to define and come to terms with the idea that we need to find some way so that Congress can't just remove a president because they don't like him or can't just move or president because they don't like his policies\nBecause he knew that that would happen\nThey assumed would have it they they they were classically trained all these gentleman um they really read their their democratic history if Greece and Rome\nAnd they understood that any power that was a ... that was possible for a a form of government that form a government would assume there to phrase is another way it was a wonderful phrase that they use all the time\nA power encroaches that power is always grasping power always wants to extend itself so if you give a power to a branch of government in this case if you give Congress the ability to added swim remover president the presumption is they will\n[noise] so you have a team impeachment set a ... it with helium send out and then there's governor Morris of Pennsylvania and it's not he wasn't governor of Pennsylvania right this is a you know different spelling ... governor here okay thank you um why did he object to the possibility of impeachment\nWell simply for the reason why he didn't want to give too much power to any ... any one branch there he was really worried that if we have someone who is impeachable\nThen that would essentially remove their ability to act independently and crucially remove their ability to act as a check against the other power in this case the legislature and he actually her really pragmatic view of this he said you know the truth matter is if a person is a bad president\nThey will be voted out of office the next term if a person is a ... you know ... dastardly president they too will be voted out of office in the next term essentially said\nTime solve all problems and that the disruption and the destruction of the political system that would come inevitably from trying to remove one branch of government by another\nBut that's worse in many ways than just letting things right out and I have to say this is a a real you know if you will Eighteenth century idea and the notion of time\nTime I get a lot less done in four years in the Eighteen century dwelling\nAnd you you had a lot less worried about nuclear missiles ... to be honest so this is something I think that argument that it's difficult for us to wrap our minds around we think you know the next news cycle is is too long and here is is more is arguing that well\nIn case of a really bad president just sit tight and worked to get him a removed from office at the next election\n[noise] so um that was a pragmatic argument it it makes sense and Franklin comes along with a truly realistic argument and says listen\nWhile you know one of one of the things about Franklin and this is not my phrase but it's often used that she is the founder for weeks at us and all of his writings that he never entirely sure when he's making a joke or not which I think was also part of his um political power at the time so Franklin makes the point in the middle of the constitutional convention\nThat really a president should embrace the idea of impeachment embrace the idea of a trial if they do something wrong because what happened in the past whenever we had bad leaders\nWell they got assassinated and really isn't it better to have a trial the assassination and we need to find somewhere centrally to keep violence out of this problem\nUm what's interesting about the the debates and sue is that I'm no one actually comments on Franken's assertion that one gets the sense from reading Madison's James Madison's notes of their constitutional convention there is almost a dead pause where people look at Franklin and say\nOkay we're going to move on now because they're not entirely sure if they're if he's joking himself but he doesn't make an important point either way which is that you want to find a legal way of doing these things so that the rule of law is always paramount you don't want an extra legal violent way of removing him authority because that frankly will open up the door for doing that again and again and again\nSo is it it's article ... section for the constitution what does that say\nWell that the president can removed or if he is guilty as you mentioned bribery\nTreason or high crimes and misdemeanors let me also stress it's actually not just the president of any high federal official\nUm some judges for example we heard a little bit of talk about perhaps and move against justice Cavanaugh a sport impeachment protecting is not going to go anywhere but it would be the constitutional remedy if you will\nIf people in Congress decided that new evidence came up to any federal official should be removed from from power and really the bribery is something that we need to understand that we typically understanding our own day or so of course as treason\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors that's that's the one that always gets everybody going our day\nSo I actually we're going to make this a cliffhanger because I Want to make sure we have plenty of time to talk about this we're gonna take a quick break now my guest is Jeffrey a angle founding director of the center for presidential history at Southern Methodist university\nHe's a co author of a brand new book called impeachment and American history if you've got a question you can call into one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you can email think T. E. R. A. dot org or find us on Twitter at K. E. R. A. thank [noise]\n...\nHere's what you need to do if you really want to violate all semblance of cooperation\nAnd Johnson does a which not surprising given Jonathan's personality and the fact that he thought it was a violation of his executive authority as president the specific cases that he winds up firing the secretary of war who have been Lincoln's secretary boiling Stanton and this essentially precipitate the crisis where Congress can now turn and say look\nHe's broken the law he's done something specific that's a violation of of constitutional authority and therefore that's what we're going to try him on it's very clear that he's being tried if you will in a in a medicines for his entire personality ... policies but specifically for violating the the tenure of office act\nSo how did he survive and what was the remainder of his presidency like after he was not connected\nWell first of all their major as presidents he was actually remarkably short if it's important to recognize that in the same month that he is I'm not convicted by the Senate\nBy a single vote in that same month um general US Grant was nominated by the Republican Party to be the next president so we're talking about the spring of Eighteen sixty eight so the elections only a few months away when the entire trial is going on\nNow to the question of how he managed to get convicted I think he he did the old fashioned way he rides his way or as a problem um he knew\nSenators who of their own conscience would think this was a violation of congressional authority that this was something that will be destructive of the constitution going forward\nBut he also knew there was some senators that were on the fence and perhaps if they were promised plum jobs or palm opportunities that they could be persuaded to you know flip to his side and ultimately enough to do so that he is found not guilty by a single vote\nSo Johnson's uh pretty bad guy but he was also a victim of partisan politics um\nLet let's fast forward to Richard Nixon um how political was the case against next next [noise]\nYou know interesting you know if it wasn't as political as perhaps the other two cases I mean you know and of course I had just to do surveys clear on this Nixon was never impeach\nNixon was going to be impeached and I think it's very clearly he was going to be convicted at that point and read the writing on race so after um the Judiciary Committee passes articles of impeachment and ... and to the full house for a vote\nThat's when Nixon decides he wants to get out so that he can go down in history as a president who is not impeached officially we all know what's going on here but it's the the legal technicality\nShe's the president I think who really of all the three that we look at is the one who is in died in most for doing political harm to the country for a high pressure doing those high crimes exactly you know Johnson I think you could say was the victim of a bad policies but really the victim of politics\nUm I have no sympathy for Johnson except for the fact that I think he did not actually commit a crime or a misdemeanor\nI'm no sympathy whatsoever Nixon on the other hand I think did things which ultimately we think in retrospect there really is very few historians of anything I've ever found\nIn the twenty first century who look back and say you know Nixon was innocent Nixon didn't do anything we all can debate Johnson\nAnd Clinton who I'm sure we'll talk about in a few moments but nobody debates the guilt of of Richard Nixon at this point but what's fascinating about that is that he was not necessarily politically unpopular until the very very and in fact most Americans didn't we're not in favor of impeachment\nEven Eighteen twenty months after the Watergate investigations have been going on there was only after irrefutable evidence of period of the president's guilt by which I mean revelation of what we call the smoking gun audiotapes which are tapes that Richard Richard Nixon made of himself in the oval office\nAdmitting the crimes that he did was he was conversing with ... writing and saying very explicitly here's how we're going to get out of breaking the law\nUm once Americans heard that it was all over and he has ... support collapses within a matter of days\nJust to think I'm Chris Boyd before that smoking gun tape Nixon had price has said this is a witch hunt [noise] yeah\nYou know she she she really came up with something which we hear a lot or they simply wrote the playbook if you will um he says it's a witch hunt\nOr he says that this is a fishing expedition that basically they're just trying to find anything that they can pin on him his political enemies I remember of course the Democrats do control the Congress at this point so they have a great deal of investigative authority um he also says that this has gone way too long\nThat if there was something why can't you produce it we need the investigation to wrap up already it's distracting from the American people and basically tries every way possible to undermine the legitimacy of the investigation against him\nHe knows of course that he is guilty um but the truth the matter is he also thinks he can get away with it and I think you know if you ran that experiment again there's a series of events that occur that really set the ball rolling towards what we think of as inevitable impeachment and removed from office\nBut I think there's a very good chance that he could have politically survived a lawyer had made different move a person had not confessed to the tapes being available for example\nThat he would have survived is by doing exactly what she suggested which was by trying to get the investigation to and prematurely and having the majority of his supporters believe it's an illegitimate investigation so it didn't matter what conclusion was reached\nUm and that was helpful to Bill Clinton ultimately\n[noise] yes well you know Clinton I think is is because he's a third case he again is the is the one who um is most clearly in my mind's a victim of opposition politics which is to say\nYou know Johnson is a victim of politics but the majority and he was ... were were Republicans and he was actually elected though he was a Democrat on the Republican ticket a Clinton was clearly impeached and then tried by the opposition\nAnd very clearly Clinton was not tried or impeached for\nWell anything that I think a reasonable person ...\n... like how we got her a lot of people remember it as ... as Clinton being impeached for his affair with Monica Lewinski but that's not specifically what got him in trouble you\nKnow she was impeached like he was a student teach specifically\nFor lying to a grand jury over his previous relationship with Paula Jones and then subsequently over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky so he was essentially indicted for perjury if you will and perjury about is a fair so everyone in discussing the matter you\nKnow if you and I were sitting at a coffee shop in back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nBe saying to ourselves should a president be impeached for an affair\nBut legally he was impeached for lying to her grand jury about the affair which raises the question if you lie about where the nuclear missiles are or if you lie about how much you've stolen from the treasury that's pretty clearly a high crime if you lie about trying to cover up in infidelity [noise]\nMost Americans are necessarily hurt by your infidelity no matter what you did your marriage is not necessarily about the nation is not a high crime and so really that's ultimately I think why Clinton is able to win acquittal in the Senate\nNot only for political reasons would just say the Democrats had enough votes as they held together to keep a super majority from occurring but ultimately because they recognize that this was not a high crime and therefore they could do with their party and said it with their conscience\nClinton was and is are really masterful communicator how did he manage to actually improve his approval rating throughout the course of this proceeding against ... you know\nI think a couple of things um first of all he tried very hard and they actually I like to say that Clinton actually ran three presidential campaigns ah the first Ninety to the second in Ninety six and then the third to stay in office if you will and it really wasn't active presidential campaign and trying to\nMake public opinion essentially believed that when you and I were having this discussion on a coffee shop over whether or not that presidents should be impeached for having sex if we had that discussion\nThat's exactly what he wanted she wanted people not to think about the illegality he wanted to people who are the perjury right because because it doesn't affect the economy it doesn't affect national security it doesn't affect the ... the price of coffee in Topeka\nUm it's about his life and as long as you kept it focused on his life people could think he was a jerk and people did but they also could think that he was a jerk who is being persecuted by his political enemies for moral reasons and for political reasons\nNot for actual impeachable reasons and he ultimately is very successful in getting people to focus\nOn those elements on his enemies if you will\nBut also we have to remember the country's going pretty darn well at this time yeah and he was doing exactly we this is our unit polar moment um this is my one of the United states is popular and and Clinton as popular around the world and he's a very appealing charismatic leader so consequently people look around and say well I'm not sure this is a high crime\nI think he's being unfairly persecuted\nAnd I like the way the country's going why should we remove this guy\nAnd I guess is Jeffrey angle founding director of the center for presidential history at SMU and co author of
