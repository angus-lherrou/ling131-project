[noise]\nOf those one hundred and fifty one one regret it at the rest did not and all of them thought about it daily\nAnd uh one of the women that I spoke with many of the women that I spoke with actually cited the reason that they could not afford to take care of the children they had\nIf they had another baby a and in fact statistically that bore out Seventy five percent of women who terminate a pregnancy say it is because of economic reasons\n[noise] so you weren't looking for a study that might determine whether in fact improving economic conditions for women who have an unplanned pregnancy might reduce the rate of abortion in this country and you found no one is even done that study\n[noise] yeah there's there's so much that hasn't been looked at when it comes to reproductive rights and\nIt's really interesting because I really think we keep snagging on roe versus Wade we keep falling over that and assuming that is the only thing we should be talking about when we talk about reproductive rights and I do have a lot of theories having written this book and wait all sides and talk to people on both sides of this issue\nI can tell you that I I don't think we ever are going to agree um about reproductive rights I I think that people who are pro life come from a place of very deep conviction and\nAnd compassion just as much as their counterparts on the pro choice I'd do 'em and for that reason you know no one is going to argue that a fetus is the life process we know that biologically the real question is\nIs a fetus a person and of course if you're pro life you say it is and that's very important because it comes down to bodily autonomy a person should have the right to make decisions about their own body including being born of what you would say if you are pro life\nI Would argue as well at what point during the process does the woman stopped being a person and how do you give rights to that fetus without taking them away from her\nYou know in there and live the conundrum I'm there aren't a lot of studies that have been done about ways to reduce the abortion rate if we if we can make economic uh growth possible for women so that the the choices more valid one\nUm but I have I have a lot of thoughts about it and I I Do think that one of the things we should look at our laws other than roe versus Wade if we know that Seventy five percent of women choose an abortion because they can't afford to have a child well why not raise the minimum wage why not have universal healthcare that would cover not just maternity\nBut also the life of your child's health\n... what about um\nHaving federally funded daycare what about penalized in companies that\nPromote women because they have to keep leaving the workforce to have those babies those are all very interesting laws that never get discussed [noise] well\nWhat we like is a silver bullet if you'll pardon the pun in this particular situation we we want something that is a direct line to the problem that we hope to solving and all of those things or indirect lines aren't they\nWell they are but I also think that you know that that for me it was the the reason for writing this book\nWhat a woman believes is different when that same woman is fourteen or thirty or forty five depending on where she is in her life\nAnd how secure she is and how stable she is and what else is going on in her life you know I think that we're we fall on the spectrum of being pro life or pro choice\nIsn't just a matter of that fundamental beliefs but it could change for an individual woman over the course of for a lifetime and when you start to pick that apart you realize that in this country we legislate reproductive rights laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray and therein lies the problem\n[noise] I Want to talk about the character of Dr ward who is it's a study in contradictions tell us a little bit about him\nWell Dr ward is very heavily based on a real life man named ...\nWillie Parker willy is one of the doctors that I was privileged to speak with interview and then shadow while he went about his day is a working at a clinic in Alabama and Mississippi\nSo I'm Dr ward and Willie Parker are are both abortion doctors they are both devout Christians who say that they performed the service not in spite of their religion but because of it\nAnd if you talk to Willie Parker who is a very vocal um feminist and an ardent supporter of reproductive rights\nHe will tell you that she was sitting in church listening to a sermon on um [noise] uh the good Samaritan and he thought who will provide health care for these women in need if not me [laughter]\nAnd he went back and got certified to perform abortions and he began flying all over the country to the most underserved areas to perform them and that's exactly what Dr more deaths as well and it's why he is in Mississippi on that particular day\nUm he's a remarkable remarkable character and it was so much fun crawling around in his head space because ah\nHe reminded me so much of the real life really Parker who is a character and a wonderful man enough himself\nAnd you say the real life Dr Parker understands that if the this is the life he doesn't believe it's ... can you talk more about her instincts and\n[noise] yeah it's it's pure biology basically you know it's science and and when you actually look at um at flat out science\nUh we know that a life process is what happens when you fertilize an egg and it becomes an embryo and then it becomes a fetus the question is at what point is that all the cells that combination of\nGrowing body functions when does that's become a conscious person\nUm you know and that has historically been decided all over the chronology and math by religion [noise]\nDifferent religions believe different things\nAnd of course if you're Catholic you believe that life begins at conception their other religions um that say that a of a baby isn't a person until like forty days after birth I mean it's really it's totally out there depending on what you believe\nBut scientifically we know it's the life process I'm an any doctor will tell you that they just will not they will not agree that it is a person while in utero\nAnd you know someone who is pro life will argue oh but we have priming janitor we're constantly giving rights to the unborn legally well that's true but someone pro choice will say All right but you have to be born in order to act on those rights and for them that is the dividing line\nYou know you have to be born you have to be able to survive without being connected to a uterus in some way or you know some kind of of a medical assistance to stay alive\nThere really is no way to draw a solution that is sad I mean that's why we haven't right but the the reason we're still arguing about decades after it's been settled law is that there's no way there's no one from both sides to sort of get what they want with a single policy no\nAbsolutely not and you know with that said I think it's really important to ask well where do we go from here ... because I can tell you we're never going to a great period [noise]\nSo what I Would like to propose having done all this research are several things I think it's really important to start with a couple of basic premises which is a that\nNobody wants to have an abortion [noise]\nYou know you don't wake up and go I have nothing better to do today it's a very heavy and and well well thought out decision even for a woman who chooses to terminate a pregnancy\nSo with that in mind the obviously the easiest way to decrease the abortion rate is to not get pregnant right [noise]\nAnd yet the people who are often the most ardent pro life are also very often anti contraception\nThat to me is a really interesting and hypocritical argument because suddenly the argument shift away from this is the fetus is a person this baby is a person it's all ready human it's already it's already a human being\nToo I'm less control women's sexuality\nAnd I'm confused by that now I Am admittedly also not Catholic and I'm I Do not have that kind of keep them behind me\nAnd I've spoken to many wonderful women who have explained to me why they feel that the church is really important to them and why they feel that\nChoosing not to use contraception is their choice rather than something that's being handed down to them and I think that's totally great if it works for them as long as they can recognize it may not work for for other people um you know what I Do think we need to unpack that a little I think we need to ask why if\nPeople really want the abortion right to go down we are and then trying hard to increase access to contraception and sex at\nMy guest is novelist Jodi Pico her new book a spark of light tells the stories of people present when a gunman storms and abortion clinic if you'd like to join our

[noise] um well I think I'm I mean you've talked about the stigma and I understand that why do you think there have been so few stories\nOf women who had abortions for reasons other than you are you know even if people disapprove of abortion they can sort of make an exception for a threat to maternal health sometimes conception by race or incest sometimes fetal abnormalities the women who tell stories about having had abortions\nAlmost always have one of those um reasons to sort of justify to people who disapprove their decision\nRight right I've heard many stories from women who\nDid not have the those extreme cases but who you know really had good reason to terminate a pregnancy\nThe woman who had a Fifteen week abortion that I observed told me that she has three children under the age of four and\nShe can barely afford to feed them and if she had this force baby she would not be able to take care of the children that she already had so does that make her a really bad mom or a really really good one\n... you know it it really depends on your perspective how does she feel about it she said\nI mean nobody is jumping for joy in an abortion clinic look you know it's not it's not something anyone decide slightly and I think I think that's important for people who are pro life to know that even the woman who make these choices they've come to the end of their rope\nAnd they have they're not live about it\nThey understand why someone pro life would feel the way they do but for them at that moment in their lifetime with their financial ability with the current situation of you know where they live and who the father is and what else is going on in their life\nThis is the right decision for them\nThey would never tell you that you have to go have an abortion WBUR ticketless but they they would like I think other women to understand\nWhy it might be the right decision for them the character of them themselves I mean\nThe character of Georgia is really interesting here this is a vigilante who stormed the women's center as a kind of vengeance for his daughters abortion even though she's doing this you sort of caught up in this in this rage that he's had and then he's realizing it doesn't feel the way he thought he would\n[noise] [noise] right and you know there's that that weird sense of vigilante justice and he is doing this for his daughter but he also recognizes that he's taking a life\nYou know he's gone in and he's killed several people and he's his motivation for going into this clinic is because people in his mind or taking away the lives of children so you know does that make him any better than what he's arguing against and I think that kind of hits him a little late\n... my guest is novelist Jodi Pico we're talking about her new book spark of light if you'd like to join the conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to you're listening to think I'm ... [noise] All right let's go to the phones now we have Barbara calling from Houston Hi Barbara\nHigh high go right ahead plates I Barbara [laughter]\nUm I just wanted to make a point that um they're the author said that they're that Catholics you know I'm Catholic and they have like a new birth control a\nNow while the tagline is that they don't use artificial means the birth control we do offer natural natural family planning classes it's a continuing education where women learn\nWhen their bodies are fertile and they can either choose to plan on having a baby or they can avoid the fertile period of time that I just wanted to\nMake ... I was yes I'm Barbara you're of course you are right and I've talked to many many Catholic women who have informed me that I Will also let you know and I'm sure you know that there are lots of people for whom natural family planning does not work and many of them wound up with an unwanted pregnancy as well\nWhy do we have such a high rate of teenage pregnancies in the United states as compared with Canada or just about every country in Europe\nWhen I can tell you the answer that [laughter] so in America there are Thirteen birth per thousand teenage girls in Canada it is a six per thousand in Sweden er and France I think it's seven per thousand it is I'm considerably less in many many other first world countries\nAnd we know from studies that have been done\nGlobally the difference is available free birth control contraception and um the a predominant of sexual education classes at the school level\nSo what happened after that it it it literally makes a difference that's it that's what reduces the teen pregnancy rate\nWhat did you learn about why the number of abortions in the U.S has been declining in recent years\n[noise] so that's a really interesting statistic and um\nWhat's fascinating about it is that yes we have seen a decline in the abortion rate however it's a little bit of a false statistic because if you break out the the numbers abortions have been declining for excuse me for rich women\nBut they have been rising steadily for disadvantaged women for poor women\nAnd that is of course the for me the really important thing to think about when we talk about roe versus Wade you know if roe versus Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court it's not as if abortion suddenly disappears what really happens is it goes back to the states\nAnd the reason this becomes an issue is because there are seven states right now that have only one abortion clinic and the only reason that clinic is still in existence is because of the little phrase and were versus Wade undue burden that they they're kept the undue burden other woman going to get an abortion [noise]\nUm yeah once that laws overturned those clinics disappear and I think we'll see a lot of states particularly in the Bible belt in the south where we don't have any clinics in the state and in that case you have a poor woman who becomes at the mercy of her ZIP Code\nWhich women will always be able to travel to get an abortion but we can't say that about poor woman and that's why we tend to see that women of color and poor women are the ones who are most affected by the two hundred and eighty plus laws that have become a state level threat to reproductive rights\nOn the other hand you don't believe that overturning roe v Wade would end abortions why not\n[noise] I ... I\nI think that there will continue to be\nClinics in the north um I think it would be very hard for a for roe versus Wade to completely be wiped out I think what will actually happen is that I'm like I said\nIt will not be a federal law it will be decided at the state level and so different states particularly the ones I imagined that are considered progressive where are the ones that are northern states I'm On the eastern seaboard will continue to have clinics [noise]\nUh I don't I I think to put America back in a place where abortion is illegal we're going to see such an incredible rate of maternal deaths\nWe saw before we know what will happen again a but again it's going to be affecting poor people women of color because a lot of rich women are going to be able even if they have to leave the states they can do it they can cross into Canada they need to\nUm you know ... you become your after mercy of your of your economic privilege\nMy guess is novelist Jodi Pico her new book a spark of light tells the stories of people who were present when a gunman stormed an abortion clinic at looks at that day and the circumstances leading up to that day from a variety of different perspective\nIf you'd like to be part of this conversation you can call one eight hundred nine three three five three seven to ... you can email think a key E.
