[noise] my limbs pronounced dead until ... when I talk for a little bit\nAnd don't mind if I can just walk around started induced myself to people who were you guys from in Florida Tampa, Florida are you from Tampa okay so we just made the drive and I don't\nQuite know what I was expecting I guess I just thought it was you know going to be a local and for this one person but\nAs I started to meet people I started meet people from all over from Tampa from Palm Beach whereabouts in New York I mean there were people from all over the country is slapped by Brooklyn Chicago Georgia and yes it's my son in Oregon I started seeing these people who win the T shirt in check and then you have to have with the big picture of a young black man's face or a name\nBeth ah they represent aimed to watch out there was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation put her on her shirt\nSays capping down and read he was fourteen years old when he was killed he was out there in the same cap\nAnd gown met another mother is going on for years so I have maybe about ... ... where the name of her twenty three year old son Rodney Mitchell on her shirt at one with the waste okay Charlap the arrest and black and yellow one I have to make a color what I have a black and white ...\nI started getting shirt half your shirt after sure and I think by the time like forty people had shut up and they're all these different shows I I just realized like\nOh this is not just a thing for one person this is a network\nLike almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a\nHusband even even daughter to cleave silence and in fact when I spoke to one of those women you just heard have won with ... wait a minute and talk of Clinton's her twenty four year old son rocky Mitchell he was shot and killed by police turn a traffic stop we're actually going to get into that story later but she\nTold me that I've met about four hundred other mothers they'd reached out to me and I were a hundred oh yeah really yeah through like traveling around through Facebook I've met border ... other mothers who lost their children wow [noise] and so I was just seemed\nLike a fraction of that occurs community center got the scales rising rate and the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up thirty seven year old Alton Sterling forty year old parents ... I'll be the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come\nOut and man when children hooked up to eight pounds Monet painting painting\nFor like two days you see them on television that big bad dude was my twin brother that big bad dude was a\nThen they kind of recede mhm and they're gone I guess what I thought it you know probably they have these long drawn out legal battles and then you know they go back to their lives whatever like whatever that means\nBut instead it's like oh no what happens is they get like folded up into the network\nWas first of all those ... several determines with his family\nAnd so at the center there was a moment of prayer where the forty to fifty people sat down at these big round dining tables resources\nOnce upon a time of all the ...\nThere was nowhere to no one wants to do was ...\nParental holiday shows on Harlem is or is it hot dogs here from out levels we are students for low for the summer\nAnd so after the prayer Christel House in the back of the room for everybody to eat so everyone stood up\nBy just totally changed in somebody put on some M. J. and a lot of people started crowd around these two big picnic tables latest\nMine just uh I mean I'm not going to make out what\nOh no no no no comment which is where I met this woman I mean the only comment I was looking for ways you could just described for me what we got on the table because I'm just ah what kind of have yeah just what's on the I mean that's the cable writer so I think you have to have you\nWork on what about you got to ask you got you Brits you've got to bake it you've got you thought you got everything you want to have to get nice looking for the day\nI got to get him

don't have it right now out of the car and I have the right now I Do have the right now I remember I didn't get a loan for\nFor our movie I'm giving you a lawful order\nHeart\n\nAnd do you what do you well know meant to be seen it gets out of the car but you know you're doing it over there [noise]\nAmjad Ron I'm Robert Krulwich and just let's just pick right back up with our our story from Florida with Tampa Bay times you would have been Montgomery and our own\nMass casualty right so day to day too was Daytona lend three [noise]\nMay third Daytona Beach Daytona Beach about everything\nAnd what happened was we went to the same with these women mostly black who have lost people to police violence and I'm time sitting across the table from African American city councilman Daytona Beach and I told him what I've been working on I told them some of the numbers we've learned and he said you really need to meet our police chief\nShells that her name is Mike ... or just yeah just a minute [laughter] okay he's a police chief of Daytona Beach [noise]\nKnown for a while the rocker spring break scene [noise]\nThey have bike week the draws five hundred thousand bikers from all over the country [noise]\nDaytona international speedway\nThe permanent population there is like sixty two thousand people and over that six year period they've only had four police shootings and then slow yeah for a city like that that's really low Jesse\nI Need to break down one thing and in fact while we were there by race of tickets and arrest\nGiven that is a system pronounce these spreadsheets there were others there the stats\nThey get to do the math\nAnd these ... it's actually kind of fascinating 'cause if you look at them you know when you just go right down here and you can add them up for things like aggravated aggravated assault theft shoplifting or speeding\nOr arrest ratio and our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city in terms of racial demographics yeah we're we're roughly a sixty forty shitty sixty percent of white ... percent African American\nAnd so when you look at these numbers it's pretty much what you seats that tickets for speeding about sixty forty rest for theft about sixty forty\nThat's the way we are supposed to in theory approached all\nAnd so what are they doing differently well a whole bunch of things first of all\nWhen all these these incidents were occurring in or\nAround the country was ... and everything else we did a race and policing mandatory training for the entire pd and basically what we wanted our officers to do is number one to learn the history of the country was history of the country is that we are racist nation number I Want to look at it started with moving the Indians\nOff of their land for manifest destiny or when you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the civil war is yoga slavery when you look at a Bull Connor for example\nOf turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers so it's important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community and you may think an act and talk away where you think you're being respectful and understanding but in reality you're not\nBut let's not for a moment think that there isn't biased in in policing because they're spies we all have biased in is a and the trick is it I don't know what to trick at a I don't know of any of us know how to contain that how do we stop that bias from coming for when you make a decision\nRight and I think in a you know I've read a lot about implicit bias and now it seems like I'm like I say feels like a kinder way to say here like a fear of a black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you're encountering a white person when you're out on the job as a cop when\nYou look at some of the shootings you record on video and I and I think is a poor school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota oh the clinics just you know there's a guy who told the officer in do uncertain terms I'm a good guy\nI have a gun permit you can't get a gun permit if you're a convicted felon you can't get a gun permit if you're a drug dealer\nSo when the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason\nThat officer threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy in his what his kid his girlfriend according stomach Gump or mental there this is this is an easy car stuff for some reason and ... and the reason is because of the color of the man's game all those things never registered black Irish shippers by his pocket\nAnd I should and and I would like to tell you and all my years in policing I Would like to sit here and be not even tell you\nThat we don't you don't want people and the twenty eight year practitioner law enforcement a second generation up I'm appalled at what I see it when there's videos I could not believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control\nSome of them I understand what's going on I mean wrestling in the ground for your life and and and you know there there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident Minnesota I mean are you kidding me looking at what are we doing\nI mean how do you how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they're not already operating at this level of heightened fear or the perceived threat\nIn my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound you have to train using it real life scenarios that take that extra split second before you fired your weapon and I'll give you an anecdotal rubbery quickly when I first joined the Philadelphia police department we were shooting people\nAt a crazy rate on an accidental discharge the officer had their finger on the trigger when they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger\nSo they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had a ... trained on how to keep your finger on the site plate the weapon not on the trigger so that that happened you wouldn't accidentally tripping fire and shoot somebody\nAnd you weren't a thought it was warm and getting oh my God they're going to get killed one reality\nWhat it did was each slow down your field division it's slow everything down that split second didn't make a difference that blood given I didn't make a difference it made a difference in your knock shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been the color of my glass coming out my cell phone was a cell phone\nSo you buy yourself a little bit of time and this is the thing that comes back to again and again it's his idea of time in certain situations slow down when you're dealing with the mentally ill person slow down like whatever you can do you cover just create some space to buy yourself another thirty seconds that extra thirty seconds maybe the difference between you're saving your life\nIn somebody else's life another interesting thing was in Ben Ben found is that also through some of the reporting with other police chief\nIs the idea that some ... cheese don't like to hire kids out of high school like Nineteen twenty year olds in part because there was there was this the text alive [laughter]\nThat's all they know how to communicate is like this and then when it when they look up and go to talk to somebody and and I'm Serious about was it the drive to a McDonalds and they get pissed off the person order and cheaper how how did you do it it's just their demeanor just the way they act\nIn fact been told me that he tested and police chief who told him the young people who are coming into the Academy of past years\nHave never been in a physical fight which is a problem because when they get into a fight their heart starts to race in their muscles tense up and they don't really know what to do so they freak out and they're way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapons to uh you know\nTo to end the confrontation huh so how do you ... you can't ask her how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on you know so that Ben says that that's why I mean she told him he looks to hire bouncers icy bouncers or for chip what he said\nFrom just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military they are my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the policy\nBasically you know how to not freaked out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important things to it says\nHere's you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff over there for Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day you have to get to know people\nYeah cool alright sure\nAnd so to make this point chip which got up walked me down the hall to another office\n[laughter] that sent me down in a computer sound comes a point that it's okay\nTo show me the video to video starts\nSilence and body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as you said is a partner both cuts are white also it's night so\n[noise] ... for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people whose office made said he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly where they park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nHomo this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking to them cop or anybody can end this black man goes on race pretty big negative than any walking toward the cops once\nYou start going crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body can pull out the taser the other officers out it was added a free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nI put it down is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then hey hey hey hey [noise]\nThe guy was fighting him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're gonna do you're going to get a game\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over and then she\nBecame central four cups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the ...\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't do ... I wanted to show your best shot and see if I hear you on a guy you want to die [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer corps of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our house or do you want to\nBe to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's huh\nYou said this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Austin", "day": "08"}
