I'm Robert Krulwich uses radio lab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nSo our money goes to talked about the\nKind of resembled Mickey Mantle blonde hair blue eyes good looking at too much because I just in the background that's it you know there was a lose lose case there's no money in it you know the prosecution had three eyeball witnesses they had his car at the scene of the crime and they had a two week\nFlight but he was guilty and I said I'm not going to try to prove he didn't do that I wanted to go in and sanity different maybe Guerra murdered this kid bug maybe it was because the temporarily gone insane community he's crazy he really believes this I'm telling you\nAbout money to put on top of that money tells him was just going to be a big case if we pull this off for me to take your while but eventually\nHe says I'm In right now we're into a late August Nineteen Seventy three so we went up to the hospital\nWhen they got there they went up to ... them up on the fifth floor of the hospital police are standing guard they walked into the room\nAnd seeing them and while we were you to each other and we talk\nAnd just a picture this gym told me that the room they put Darryl in was what he described as a training observation room which meant that it had a big window that ran alongside girls dead so they could keep an eye on him and the cops are stationed right outside just\nWatching\nAnd according to a gym and I should say I've heard differing accounts about this but apparently the cops had brought in a lip breeder to try ... saying wait a minute\nI I don't think you can do that right I mean that's not legal\nYeah I I think that's probably not okay um but from the cops perspective they think that he's involved in a recent murder\nAnd a missing girl and they think that girl could still be alive so they want to know absolutely anything they can that's going to get them closer to solving that murder and finding that girl but at the same time\nThe defendant has to be able to share absolutely every thing with the lawyers and know that they're in that safe spaces that relationship\nBecause we have sixth amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself\nHistory checked freedom of speech ... attorney then you have no real justice system\nAnd Armenian bell gee they need as much information about what Gary was done as they possibly can get so they can start to build their defense\nI don't like surprises I'm the kind that wants to know everything\nWow so so that as a lawyer you're in a strange spot here\nMhm he needed to get from Gary out his story and it needed to be just that me didn't want the cops in on it yet\nAnd you don't know if those tax in the room or what\nSo their turn off the TV turn up the fans but to me was playing games to keep talking basically about anything but but the case has kept saying he couldn't remember he couldn't remember and\nThey're trying to convince and like you've got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot\nIt's like a Lynch mob both the police pretty much have you cold there's witnesses and Guerra knew he could be going to prison he could be going to prison for a long time maybe twenty five to light and pet it found prison you have to cure for things get rough\nBut they tell him if you talk to us maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity that was only two friends to help get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a person that was the gal\nSaid have anything to say say no it took several conversations to get Garret at this point but finally Darrell Puerto solo [laughter]\nAnd what he said and how he said it that's that's waiting on the other side of this very brief break we'll be right back\nHi my name is David David over and I'm calling from the radio lab is supported by ...\nAn online service that lets people send and receive money internationally and they're autonomous account less tough in this whole and ... local currency is at any for ... ... ...\nIs our family a cap and trade radiolab is supported by targeting preventing future her a new podcast that explores the work makers across the country and\nProject from cities like Miami Washington DC or New York city ... heart available on apple podcast or wherever ...\nI'm Tracey ...

Pfeifer architecture hey I'm ...\nI'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and just before the break we were about to hear Robert Gallo the man accused of murdering a teenager show his attorney what really happened\nYeah and we're going to jump right back into that but if you're just doing it now you should be warned that they are at what comes next is uh probably not suitable for the ears of young kids are sensitive listeners so be warned that will go back to reporter British [laughter]\nAt this point it was just ... in the room and he told him\nYes he had killed them ... and he also killed other people too and the episodes when Darrow killed people seemed to have\nMr ... coming to my office\nAnd he said can I meet with you and talk to you in an Armani agreed to it\nSo he comes in takes a seat and they asked them father father is there anything you can tell me about my daughter I mean\nThe papers think that ... that Carol probably has something to do other disappearances or anything at all that he's told you that that can help me\nBut I couldn't tell him Andy thing\nAnd I'm Renee just he says no I Can't tell you there's nothing that can tell you\nBut I remember trying to reassure him that look kind of meeting set up\nAll I can say is it's a state investigators and the prosecutor on the case\nThey could have some information for trying to give them hope that we were brings to conclusion I thought he would return\nSo then when Mr pets leaves us Romani he loses it he threw a bunch of books we read from basically just you know destroyed his office just trying to really much\nThat I couldn't help them\nBecause he's looking right at this man knowing exactly\nWell imagining what he's going through like our money had lost\nA brother yes was much younger you for your job\nAs an air force pilot or three kids and in Nineteen sixty to his plane went down and he was lost at sea\nSo after that our money said his mother she'd be up at night crying she would like go to bed at night\nAnd my mother would wake up screaming foods you're eating\nUm [noise] you know she could liberal recover from because\nYou can't you know you just you don't really know but you know it's\nSo I can understand that\nAnd that's you know that's partly why this was so hard for our money because when that ... deal fell apart that was his chance to try to get this information\nTo the families when\nThe police all through he didn't have any other options for sharing that information he stuck\nWhat so what happens next so they have to go to trial and that means that our money and don't you have to not go down to try to present an insanity defense meanwhile our money\nHe said he couldn't sleep he was having nightmares wake up to thirty in the morning and sweat running on your back go sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee and just waiting for the morning paper to come\nBecause he was just alone or that he was alone with the secret and he knew that moment the police are trying to find these girls she knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive you you\nYou're questioning you show very\nYou're hurting people so you begin to wonder am I in the right profession you know you're looking for and you're looking for a way to give the information you know you know will make us numbers coal sure\nWhy didn't you know [laughter] if I'm gonna do it and we'll do it openly no ah I don't know\nDid he ever did you ever break now according to him now you know in my mind was doing what I thought was a proper ethical and legal moral moral thing to do and then\nIn December of Nineteen Seventy three five months after the girls disappear their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other Susan's bodies discovered by two kids who are playing up in the mines Alicia um I guess it's I think a student from Syracuse University which is right next door to the\nCemetery as walking through and stumbled upon hair and so she has discovered than to and then six months later in the summer of Nineteen Seventy four\nOpening day of the trial might be one of the most significant even though\nRobert ... trial for the murder of el ... ski begins\nRobert ... primary line of defense or apparently being not guilty by reason of insanity\nSo in order to make that case what they decided to do is is to put Darryl on the stand\nAnd you just get the facts and Guerra would tell his whole life story to a shock the jury's mind including all these murders and all these rapes to see those evil that this time he was nuts Sharon Smith channels that news in like ...\nSo the trial opens um the courtroom is jam packed prosecutions starts they have a really good case they've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from Hamilton County and then it's time for the defense to start their case\nTo Belgium stands up and he calls his first witness Robert De Niro to the stand Garrett gets on sand and he starts telling his life story and it's horrible [noise]\nSevere beatings and abused by his parents very little education basically gets sent off to a farm to work\nLike as an indentured servants when he's seven slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old weird stuff like that he started drinking blood I'm having sex and the animals\nAnd then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult life and he\nAdmits to killing Alicia and\nAnd what happens next and nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or maybe it was on purpose but when ... was talking about Susan pets ... says is that the one I found\n\nIs that the one I found so the cat was out of the back then\nThe next day Belgian our money while the press conference to try to explain why they haven't told them\nTo survive without does the ... because they had the duty to protect our clients secret for\nReading or the ... here but\nEveryone is disgusted those columns written editorials written letters to the editor\nOr just no way in the world you're going to prevent your average non lawyer everybody turned against them but this has anything short of shabby some very good of a lawn of justice\nPretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that our money in Belgium actually tried to use these dead girl as leverage for Guerra\nThe headlines in the Syracuse papers would say body's used as pawns in a game of law was bedlam among he was getting\nDeath threats in the mail and then I'd just as crazy phone calls people calling saying stuff like how can you live with yourself somebody to kill you really get to\nAt one point he finds a dead fish in his car his wife ... Molotov cocktail in the back yard you started to carry a pistol my bag he kept shock on in the car he kept on in the house so we\nCould sleep it was that was the worst moment of the blue or some horrible for [laughter]\nAs more of a\nJune twenty seventh rubber Garrett was convicted for the murder of Philip bump whiskey he's given the maximum sentence he's given twenty five years to life in a maximum security prison how did how did that feel for you\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring again to eternity\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and do you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice or\nState public health law and the provision that says the body must be given quick\nBurial and on top of that\nWe're ... we're we're ... we're we're we're we're ...\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against their money in Belgium so basically they were then facing disarm him an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nWell gee started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice moved to Florida or money tough\nIt out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or loosely well what else can I Do [noise] to make the movie he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the parade oh will destroy some pressure [noise] to to to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar is the Belgian our money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between\nAtticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven is for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed I don't\nGo was here are just was a lawyer to do this job [noise]\nMhm mhm [noise] I was a good lawyer [noise]\nSo I saw two art everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a dead bodies case ... in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "29"}
