U. T. H. D. one often you can find a saw him on a K U T dot O. R. G. communities supportive public radio from the below center at UT Austin\nThank you so much for listening right now here in Austin we're looking at a weather of Seventy degrees right now outside we are in a flash flood watch in the surrounding areas it to in effect for Kamron Willacy and Kennedy counties through Monday morning at A M\nA there is going to be a localized rainfall accumulation of three to six inches\nWhich is still hospitals like this evening we have a eighty percent chance of rain going into tonight and the low of sixty three predicted\nAnd then from Monday tomorrow through Thursday there's rain in the forecast so have the umbrella ready if you're out and about tonight or on your way to the office in the morning coming up at seven o'clock we have radiolab and kicks off\nNight programs enjoy\nYour [laughter]\nAnd\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that who don't but we have to and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must what we've done is it is on the radio yeah so she got kids with the you may want to mention one of them yeah anyway the story\n... we got to the only way you could objectively said that the baby in the mother were engaged in breastfeeding is if the baby's lips were\nTouching the woman's nipple so they included what you could call like an attachment claws but as soon as they got that rule in place [noise]\nLike you would see you know a twenty five year old woman and a teenage looking boy right and like what the hell is going on there\nOh yeah it gets really weird if you like start entering into like child age and it wasn't even going to bring that up because it's kinda gross\n[laughter] it's like breastfeeding porn is that thing or their sites like ... and so this team they realized they needed to have a new did he ruled that are allowed for breastfeeding but also had some kind of an age cap so\nSo uh so then we were saying okay once you've progressed past infancy than we believe that it's inappropriate but then [noise]\nPictures would start popping up on the screen and they'd\nBe like wait is that an infant like where's the line between infant and toddler\nAnd so the thing that we landed on was if it looked like the child could walk on\nHis or her own than to old big enough to walk too big ...\nThat can be over ... yeah that's like a year old in some cases yeah and like the world Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until you know like Eighteen months or two years which meant there were a lot of photos still being taken down\nWithin you know days we are continuing to hear reports from people that their photographs are still being targeted but\nOffer a statement saying you know that's where we're going to draw the line of using budging on policy and keep in mind through this whole episode is is perhaps the next big thing and the Facebook dot com company was growing really really fast ...\nLike almost everyone in on it and it and they're just got to be a lot more content\nWhen we first launch who are hoping for you know maybe four hundred and five hundred people and now we're at a hundred thousand so who knows or\nOur now ... more people are joining Facebook every day a million users so far the projection of two hundred\nMillion by the end of the era now more than ... than the entire us popular\nNot just within the United states but also it was growing rapidly more international\nYou know you were getting folks in India as fast as yet and turkey\nGetting big throughout the EU so they have more and more content coming in from all these different places in all these different languages\nHow are we going to keep everybody on the same page and so this small team at Facebook got a little bigger and bigger jumped up\nTo sixty people and then a hundred and they set out to create rules and definitions for every oh can we\nGo through some sort of the ridiculous exam mostly\nLess over here today so Gore Gore you mean violence kind of Gore yes so the Gore standard was headlined\nWe don't allow graphic violence and\nGore and then the shorthand definition they used was no inside on the outside no guts no blood pouring out of something blood was a separate issue there was a an excessive blood rule to come up with rules about bodily fluids\nSeeming for example would be allowed in like a clinical setting but like what does the clinical setting mean and you know does that mean if someone is in a lab coat\n... at one of my favorite examples is like how do you define art\nBecause as these people are moderating they would see images of naked people that were paintings or sculptures\nCome up and so what they decided to do is say art with naked in this can stay up\nLike it stays up if it is made out of what made out of metal\nMade out of stone really yeah because how else do you define art you have to just be like is this what you can see with your eyeballs\nAnd so from then on as they run into problems those rules just constantly updated with your constant amendment yeah constant amendments\nNew problem new rule and other new problem updated rule\nIn fact at this point they they're amending these rules up to twenty times a month\nWow really take for example those rules about breastfeeding in twenty Thirteen they removed the attachment clause says the baby no longer needed to have its mouth physically touching the nibble at the woman oh and in fact a one\nNipple and or aerial it could be visible in the photo but not to only one then twenty four team they make it so that both nipples or both aerial last may be present in the photo\nWho's is what happens in American War all the time it's very thing yes yeah\nYeah you know it sounds a lot like common law [noise] so\nCommon law is the system dating back to early England where individual judges would make ruling which would sort of\nBe a law but then that law would be amended or evolved by other judges so the body of law was sort of constantly fleshed out and face that fact [noise] literally\nEvery time this team that Facebook which would come up with a rule that they thought was airtight plop some things are going to show up and said that they weren't prepared for that sets a rule had an account as\nA as soon as you think yeah this is good like the next day something shows up to show you yeah you didn't think about\nThis for example some time around twenty eleven this content moderator is is is going through a cue of things\nThat [noise] the jak that [noise] ... [noise] exact\nAnd she comes upon this image [noise]\nMake\nThe photo itself was a teenage girl African by dressing skin breastfeeding goats of baby goats\nAnd the moderator throws their hands up and says what gives this\nAnd we Googled breastfeeding goats and found that this was the thing it turns out it's a survival practice according to what they found this is a tradition in Kenya that goes back centuries that in a drought\nUnknown way to help your her get through the drought is to uh if you if you have a woman who's ...\nTo have her nurse the kid the baby goat along with her human get ... and so there's nothing sexual about it's good for business shouldn't and theoretically if we go point by point through this list it's an infant\nIf it's sort of could walk so maybe there's an issue that but there's there's physical contact between the mouth and the nipple but [noise] but obviously breastfeeding\nNot even kidding why are you wearing protective black children or not\nThat's not a good look it's racist something's going on here there is absolutely some sort of an interest biased or systematic issue at Facebook\nHere I'm doing well thank you so much for being yeah no you're\nNot long after sitting down with Marsha Facebook invited me to come up to their offices in California and sit down with that a cut it just consider your name and your title and\nI'm Monica bigger and I leave the policies for Facebook's\nMonika bigger is in charge of all of Facebook's rules including their policies on hate speech and so after like why would there be a rule that protects white men but not black children\nWe have we have made our hate speech policies let me let me rephrase that are hate speech policies have become more detailed overtime but\nOur main policy is you can't attack a person or group of people based on a protected characteristic characteristic like race religion or gender\nSaid this takes a couple of decades to explain but the gist of it is that uh the Facebook borrowed this idea of protected classes a straight from us anti discrimination law these are the laws that make it so that you can't not hire someone say based on like their religion their ethnicity there a race\nAnd so on on Facebook you can't attack someone based on one of these characteristics\nMeaning you can't say men are trash nor could you say women are trash or because essentially you're attacking all men for being met oh it is if they all can I say Bob is trashy yeah you you can say Bob is trash because as my sources explained to me the\nDistinction is that in the first instance you're attacking a category in the second instance you were attacking a person but it's not clear that you were attacking that person because they are a member of a protected category\nOh so Bob might be trash for reasons that have nothing to do with him being man yeah he just might be annoying right okay so that explains why you take down ... why would you leave up black children or ... why would that not get taken them\nSo traditionally we allowed speech once there was some other word in it that made it about something other than in protecting characteristic\nIn Facebook jargon these are referred to as a a a non protected modify it\nJust means literally nothing [laughter] give us an example of this so traditionally if you said I don't like this religion cab drivers\nCab driver would be the non protected modify or because employment is not protected category and so what the rules state it was a when you add this non protected modify or to a protected category in this case the cab drivers religion\nWe would allow it because we can't assume that you're hating this person because of his religion you actually just may not like a cab drivers\nSo in the case of black children children is modifying the protected\nCategory of black ... and so children Trump's black their child nests Trump's their blackness you can say whatever you want about black children whereas in the case of white men or you've got a you've got gender and race both protected you can attack them\nThat's just a bizarre rule I Would think you'd go the other direction that the protected class would outweigh the\nMonitor fire well they they made this decision as they explained to me because of their default was to allow speech they were really trying to incorporate or not to the American free speech tradition\nAnd so there's a whole lot of stuff out there that none of us would defend is a valuable speech but didn't didn't rise to the level of stuff that we'd say this is so\nBad we're going to take it down and in this case their concern was were all members of like you know at least half a dozen protected categories like we all have gender we all have sexual orientation\nAnd if if you if the rule is that any time a protected class is mentioned it could be hate speech what you were doing at that point is opening up just about every comment that's ever made about anyone on Facebook to potentially be hate speech then you're left with anything right\nNo matter where we draw the line there are going to be some outcomes that we don't like they're always going to be casualties that's why we continue to change the policies\nAnd in fact since marshes debacle they've actually updated this rule so now black children are protected from what they considered the worst forms of hate speech\nNow our reviewers take how severe the attack is into consideration but\nDespite this there are still plenty of people that is flawed because you are a social network including Marsha who who think they still just isn't good enough\nThere are not systematic effort to\nEliminate white men in the way that there are other groups that's why you have protected groups\nShe thinks white men in heterosexual should not be protected\nProtect the groups who are actually victims of hate speech\nMakes sense well yeah because in sort of hate speech or are thinking about hate speech there's this idea of of privilege or of historically disadvantaged groups and that those historically disadvantaged groups\nShould have more protection or because of being historically disadvantaged ... ... and the challenge with that uh that was presented to me was okay\nTo thousands Japanese reinforce or in the Nineteen forties cut off the side\nYou had Japanese soldiers and those Chinese killing millions of Chinese during World War two oh at the same time you had Japanese American citizens than a hundred\nThousand persons of Japanese ancestry all would have to\nBeing put into internment camps\nAnd so we had to ask ourselves that question like are the Japanese and historically advantage\nOr disadvantage group huh Japanese Americans pretty easy to make a case that they were disadvantaged but in China it's a totally different story in this happened at the exact same moment so you've got to different places to different cultural stories\nIn ... when you have a website like Facebook this trans National Community they realized they decided that ideas of privilege are so geographically bond\nThat there is no way to live with the way and consider who is privileged above who and decided therefore that we're not going to allow historical advantage or historical privilege or into the equation at all\nAnd I think it's very important to keep in mind here in America these moderators only have like four or five seconds from Republicans come ... to make a decision and limited Andy On Monday but in those four seconds is there enough time to to\nFigure out where in the world someone is particularly given idea dresses can easily be math going back where you came from is it enough time to figure out a person ethnicity white children are better on black children\nOn top of that we often don't know and individuals raise rates people on the other categories or even less clear like sexual orientation\nAnd they they just realized it would be next to impossible to get anybody to be able to run these run these calculations effectively\nWhen we were building that framework we did a lot of cat and we saw some times that it was just too hard for our reviewers too\nA man a more detailed policy consistently they just couldn't do it accurately\nWhat Facebook's trying to do is take the first amendment this high minded lofty legal concept in\nConverted into a an engineering manual that can be executed every four seconds for any piece of content from anywhere on the globe\nAnd when you've got to move that fast sometimes justice loses that stay and that's\nThe tension here [noise]\nAnd I just want to make sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy peanut paste\nIf we want to have one line that we enforce consistently but it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white\nOr [noise]\nThose rules bake it
