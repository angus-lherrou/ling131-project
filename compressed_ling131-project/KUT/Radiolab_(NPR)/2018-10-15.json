I\nMean look we have one photograph of Frederick Chopin\nOne photograph\nIn that picture he's a he's going what Frederick so can really look like what was his mind\nYou know you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say oh this is what show Penn looked like well no Showtime looked like many thing\nEven the very day that that photograph was taken he had thousands of different expressions on his face but then what about a year earlier or ten years earlier I mean knowing Chopin is a very complex thing it's not one thing it's a millions of different things that we are United by analogy\nInto something that we referred to as one thing [noise]\n[laughter]\nWe should say we looked into it and there are actually two pictures show that he's kind of scaling it but you can't really don't [noise] know smiles [laughter]\n[noise]\nCaught on may not know\n... yeah he yeah you'll\nGo do miss you won't be any know\nER ER yo\nFaye Faye young\nBought a ...\n... number two are you just talking or are you doing to private ... what's that I said I Do know you try\nFellow ... story from Greg Warner yes hijack Greg ... is a NPR's East Africa correspondent\nYou are in what what time is it where you are it's um it's evening he's based in Nairobi round seven thirty in the name was ... I just told you good morning and so he um but I forgot how to say good evening so oh okay\nSo great I mean we were just a [laughter] anyhow [laughter] we call Greg ... because he had written this article for this great website called trance dot org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another\nBut there's actually a really good example that I didn't use in the piece about\nUh the failure to communicate I could tell you that story last year yeah so so there's this word and you wouldn't think of it is and translate of all but it's the word serious\nAnd when Syria is that you're in a serious like okay All right all us okay I'm In my experience when you hear this where serious in East Africa does not mean solemn or thoughtful are are stern it actually almost never has something to do with your mood\nBut serious tends to me is are you just talking to me or are you serious are you doing something and usually doing it's like some kind of transaction usually a financial I've been asked by you know many East African officials are you going to be serious with me and\nIt obviously means are you going to pay me a bride oh usually I Pretend misunderstand that they came home and I said yes I'm a very serious international journalists and um but the story that I Want to tell you and\nGood afternoon everybody I'm\nI'm really pleased to be back in Africa Secretary Kerry I just thought about his it'd Ethiopia and city of enormous energy a\nFew days before carry visit Ninety journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti terrorism law that basically says that any criticism if the government is illegal\nI had a series of very productive meeting this morning with by foreign minister counterparts\nGoing to the reason it's called the justice because it's a more complex and ...\nAnd yes because think about what that evolution says the initial thing was oh these guys are being driven crazy 'cause the shows are exploding on\nGovernments as the thinking was you know it was temporary the show goes off explodes in a moment they have a moment of shock and they need a moment of rest and then they can go back in but by world\nWar two we were thinking that's not quite right it's not just shells exploding right\nIt's the whole experience of battle it's all the shooting and the and the fear so becomes battle fatigue you're trying to generalize and you're trying to make and richer as the ... but it also becomes the tea versus shock there's less violence and the right\nBecause it because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but of overtime it becomes impossible\nFor them to go on there's a wonderful film from World war two called let there be like\nThese are the casualties of the ...\nOf trouble than mine men who aren't damaged emotionally\nAbout guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue and the reason they were calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it right away\nThen around Vietnamese as we realize you don't just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly involved in battle right and so the question became\nWhat's the source of it and she said well to nervous exhaustion said the human nervous system can only take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts\nDown hence the term operational exhaustion so that's example again when you're trying to enrich it you're saying the guys aren't cowards and not in the state of shock they're behaving the way all human beings do and then\nYou get more concerned about them and you say the real problem isn't there just their experience on the battlefield\nThe problem is is that they're in a constant state of disorder because it lingers on long after you think it's over\nYou can't just get these guys into a hospital for six months and think they're going to be better there permanently you they have post traumatic shock and then once you have a a a whole apparatus to deal with it then you become PBS the my point\nIs just that it's perfectly possible that the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract as ... as people actually are becoming more empathetic to the people who suffer from it\nSunday you buy I mean he's he's basically turned Carlin on his head and he's made the wintering blender words enrichment\nI I have I mean my only move would be to hit play on Carlin\nPoor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities [noise]\nThey don't have a negative cash flow position\nYou know fire management want it to curtail redundancies in human resources

[noise] this is Emily Emily ...\n[noise]\nSome of you may remember that a couple of years ago we did a story about Emily where she'd been hit by a truck\nGone into a coma and then her boyfriend at the time Alan or had brought her back my writing on her hands\nName [noise]\nOf all the stories we've ever done I think this one has gotten the most response and when we left that story Emily had emerged from the Komen begun to recover but she was blind totally blind right yeah like no light any nothing coming in now okay needless to say it was a very big adjustment\nI just know I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world and chest myself and\nAnd being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to draw\nAnd ... and if you ... it's hard enough you can feel the locks on the paper\nYeah\nBut then one day in the summer of two thousand and twelve she gets a call\nFrom the White House school in New York City the lighthouse school yeah is that school for the blind\nHer mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology I think they were doing this study for the FDA very experimental and her mom signed her up long story short a Emily shows up to light how school one day and walks into this room and a guy named ed gives her this thing\nHe gets his device can you describe it I mean is it a big helmet now it's not it's just say ... ... s and glasses\nThough ah they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because of right on the front like on the bridges the nose was a little camera going forward\nAnd then attached to the sun glasses was a little wire\nThat ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal\nThing has made a titanium\nAnd it's just like the size of a postage stamp\nAnd a little bit decker ...\nEd explained or is it a little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes and what was going to happen is at the camera was going to convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square so he told her to take a little square plays it on your town put it right on the center of your tongue\nAnd caused him out so I put it on and they turned\nIt on 'em and it was like as there used to take off and that in a lot of Coca Cola like a lot of levels on your town and always like frankly\nThe idea behind this thing cording to science writer Sam Kean author of the tale of doing or oh surgeons is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing in our ... hearing in our\nFingers in ... in the teasing touching but that's actually not how it works each of our senses send signals into the brain as electricity little blips on nerves and it is the brain that then converts those little glimpse into what you perceive as a site or a sound or smell now obviously\nSomeone who was blind to the retina is not sending those signals anymore but what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brain\nThen all of our brains there lots and lots of passed away is going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain and normally your brain isn't using those pathways even though they exist like there's a road there but it shut down in traffic can be on it\nBut what if you could open up some of those around\nMe just let me say that on ... an hour and to our\nEmily says at first she had no idea what was happening she would just with all her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change\nAnd every time I looked around here\nSay oh that's a chair that's ... that's ...\nActually mine and it went on like this for awhile et cetera ball in a square that's\n... ... and nothing was really happening for except for the prickly feelings on her tongue but then there was this moment\nAt had this really long staff so God\nAnd he last day in fact any move that I've been down in front of my face [noise] nosing omega ... suddenly she says she just thought it was like oh my God [laughter]\nIt just happened in ... oh ... what does it look like in some of The Mind's eye it\nLooks like a long white skinny ... did you see the texture of the sticker um no\nI couldn't see ...
