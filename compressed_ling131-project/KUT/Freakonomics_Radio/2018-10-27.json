{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KUT", "content": "I have for the last six years in my life and I continue to [noise] every day\nYou feel like you're wearing the masks every day you know and you're sort of trying to maybe play this character or something of what you think of normal looks like camping so for me my approach to it was I use my humor and my sort of personality to really\nTake the first step seeming normal loaded with my idea I guess who wasn't normal was at that time I'm not even sure there is\nSuch a thing now but at the time I was pretty convinced that there was a certain way to act and so I was super outgoing um easy to talk to someone who was really you know inclined to make jokes and it was really just this continual way of almost saying to myself I'm OK\nI'm All right you know and it was almost this way of trying to convince myself that things weren't as desperate as they really are\nAnd then I Would go into my room late at night and I would have thought so you know ending my life\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills\nWith a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came to this close to doing\nIt came as close to doing it and I didn't\nSend me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the legend look down but not jump [noise]\nOne of the lucky ones Who Survives I Survived and that just leaves with my story and my story\nIs this for simple words I suffer from depression [noise]\nUnfortunately we live in a world where if you break your arm everyone runs over to sign your cash [noise] but if you tell people you're depressed everyone runs the other way that the stigma\n\nTime as you were experiencing some of this you were trying to like lunch or career as a standup comic\n[noise] yeah in the absolute mecca of show business and Victoria, BC Canada yeah\nTotally civil wealth struggling with crippling depression you were trying to [noise] funny to um like people in comedy houses oh gosh yeah I Know\nIt's just sort of cliche so many away but yeah [laughter] yeah I Know exactly I\nYou know look I think this is part of it too right is there's this big idea that kind of says you know every wind and who does comedy or anyone is a comedian is the sort of sad clown and you know they have all these issues and you know and sometimes I Do feel a little bit stereotypical kind of living in to that\nIdea but for me you just got to think about it this way which is that when I was really recovering during that time might constant sense of\nFeeling better was watching comedy I was obsessed or you\nAre you comfortable like joking about depression and mental illness or is there like a ... as in like a party like draw a line at it I'm\nIt's difficult because I Would never want to make could show that would seem as though it's demeaning those experiences but one of the most interesting things as we kind of put up these walls in our mind around certain topics right we go we can't laugh at that that's not funny\nAnd when you were saying that what are you really sad\nLike that's too serious to laugh at that is too important to laugh at and I really thought about that question for a long time and then realize but that's one of the best ways into these conversations [laughter]\nWe all know what it is to hurt real\nAnd what it is a pain in her heart and we all know how important it is to heal\nBright now depression is society's deep cuts to working temp to put a band aid over and pretend it's not their role it is there is there and you know what it's OK\nDepression is okay if you're going through I Know that you're okay I Know that you're ... you're not reach and it's an issue not an identity because when you get past the fear and the ridicule in the judgment and the stigma of others you can see depression for what it really is [noise]\nThat's just a part of life\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I mean it's almost like that pain is a source of material\nLike it's it's like you have to have that pain to [noise] to have something to be funny\nYeah and I think in my perspective on that would be not even just to have something to be funny about to know why it even matters to me to look at it passed just oh that's you know a good laugh and just see what that really\nMeans to someone on a spiritual or emotional level and I think that we live in this world now that is so serious in so many ways and we're so plugged into our technology and we're so plugged into these\nExternal realities that feel like they're constantly you kind of knocking on the door of our mind and just begging for our attention and\nTo laugh is to find yourself back in the moment to laugh is to be free and so many ways\nAnd so for myself that's just something that I think about all the time and I try and bring into my work is just that's what I'm really here to do if I'm here to serve someone that's the way I'm serving them and that's what means the most to me I had this moment when\nI was Seventeen years old and I can remember this so clearly where I was really asking myself this question of am I going to pursue this you know is this gonna be the path that I follow and I one day saw it I went what's the definition of laughter\nAnd I went and I looked it up in the dictionary and it said the definition of laughter is the tangible evidence of how\nAnd to me that changed my whole life because I just sweat yes like that's what comedy gave me was this tangible sense of hope this not just an escape from my problem is but it's completely different reality in which I Would be so overwhelmed with the present moment with laughter that I couldn't even remember what\nThis struggle that I was experiencing on the day to day was and that\nChanged everything for me [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Kevin briel he's a comedian and author of the book boy meets depression\nYou can see his entire talk at ... dot com [noise]\nPay they listen to

is one o'clock [laughter]\nSo are we in the trade war yet well\nDefined a trade war and they'll give you that and so yeah [laughter]\nFor the past several months the United states has been trying to gain some leverage with its trading partners the president slapping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from America's closest neighbor's an ally sometimes gets a bit rough Canadians\nPolite we're reasonable but we also will not be pushed around a few weeks ago a new trade deals struck with our polite Canadian friends in Mexico\nDoes my country charge to ... percent when I'm In port you know particular product and I want to export the same product\nTo somebody else I have to pay ten or Fifteen Percent\nOr where's the fairness in this this is it's a legitimate question I think but it's much more complex than that uh these terrorists are there because they were negotiated over eighty years if you're talking about and dust with terrorists only are talking about\nMore than ten thousand lines\nTen thousand duties and that's industrial only now you have to add to that the agricultural side have to answer that deals on services as well and it's impossible to negotiate line by line\nAnd it's also impossible to apply a different terrorists to a different country imagine a situation when you apply the very same terrorists as the other is applied to you you have one hundred and sixty four countries\nAnd then to apply a different ... for that product for one hundred and sixty four and then they apply the same as yours how do you square that sort of ... possible these negotiations were done\nOn a package so there is a balance a which is not mathematical it is essentially a political balance a debt is struck now\nWhat I understand that the American position at this point in time is that we have to revise this now you know these were bad deals\nSo I'm simplify and of course I'm a very complex a scenario\nBut it's just to say that we can understand a village intimacy and the ... of some situations\nBut those situations on up there by accident uh they're there because of what they do history behind them and this is why we got to these are the Arabs in these commitments or negotiate that ended up that you\nWell let me ask you this Trump's methodology and in addition to actually uh an acting terrorists that are larger and more dramatic than we've seen in the past his methodologies different in that he communicates directly to the world primarily via Twitter\nThe trade negotiations the WTO works\nOn our multi year considered done around the table with a lotta negotiators in arbitrators and and they're kinda the opposite of a two hundred and eighty character political message\nAnd I'm really curious about the degree to which those proclamations are essentially effective as a bargaining statements um and the degree to which they are chaotic\nI think ... the problem you have with short but very strong concise and clear ah messages sometime is that you get that concern\nYou get what the problem is or what is annoying that party but what we don't get is clarity about okay so how do we fix this sometimes the answer to this question\nIs very broad the nature and ask for things that clearly are impossible to do ah so the option on the other side is to either live with this uncertainty or\nThick accent that assumes the wars\nAnd that I think is not the best way to proceed I think what we need to is not only to understand the concern what they need to understand now\nIs so ... what do we do now what are the things that we need to do reasonably speaking that can be done and how to actually you know roll up this leaves work in figure something out that is acceptable to everyone\nA that's a big challenge [noise] so\nAre those challenges being met\nAre those long and hard conversations actually happening or or\nKind of stormy holding pattern at the moment\nI think we are progressively moving forward and making progress I remember maybe a couple of years ago and there was a G ... meeting in in ... ah in China and I are made a\nA a presentation than I explained the situation of technology and the fact that he had in the labor market and they gave their seat or know eighty percent of their jobs lost lost to new technologies\nEverybody was surprised at what and that was just two years ago and some people came to me right there when we when we broke for coffee and said where did you get those numbers how how did you get this information is eight so there\nWere just not looking for it they're not looking for the causes of all this but if we do the causes of pretty evident\nIn two years' time uh everybody's talking about this no this is no news any longer\nAnd some are have already begun to talk about a reforming the system reforming the double a chill they realize that some of these concerns\nHave roots in Fort coming up the system and unless we address this these kind of patients that we see today or in terms of trade are only going to increase\nIn addition to a President Trump critiquing the WTO itself calling it a disaster saying if they don't shape up I Will withdraw hum\nAnd his terrorist activity uh\nThe u._s. has also been blocking the appointment of a WTO appeals judge without whom the organization could really be a Siamese to to some large degree I'm curious if you could talk about what you are doing to try to keep the WTO from being paralyzed for ...\nWe have to fix the situation as soon as we can by the end of next\nYear or we may reach a a critical moment when we have\nLess than three appellate body members that means that with less than three we cannot hear an appeal\nAnd therefore basically the system of district settlement collapses but having said that are members of looking at ... the first option of course is to get\nA conversation going\n... of the U.S administration or with the dispute settlements mechanism of the WTO is not new uh I myself had heard that before from previous administrations people have been asking\nSo if you're not happy with the system what do you think needs to change or how do we fix the problems do you have of course\nSome things are not negotiable\nThe system will have to continue to be independent\nIt will have to continue to be impartial a buck it can't function better than what is also a bit I'm a peculiar is that the United states has been bringing cases to the average Joe they just brought five and a few weeks ago\nSo have you ah director general of NATO had direct conversations ever with President Trump whether about the blocking the appointment of the judge or trade itself generally or anything if you have you had face to face or direct conversations with him\nNot directly no I Do have a open contacts of course with I'm Robert Lighthizer to the U.S do our eyes sometimes have conversations um in in different scenarios with other ministers as well\nBut not directly with President Trump no\nHave you had direct conversations with the leaders of other large a country's\nYes I'm quite frequently\nThe mic recently with President comb are from France and um he was very concerned with all this and we had a very very good conversation and\nHe was very much on top of what's happening and that's surprising because a wild back whenever I talk to leave there is a it took me a while to\nTo explain to them what was going on that this was not the case now a talk to him I talked to a prime minister may I I I'm going to be next month in ah in Germany or to talk with a\nA Chancellor Merkel I recently was\nIn Japan it's all to reminisce or I'd be um I've I've been\nCovering a lot of ground and we've been talking and they're all concerned [noise]\nThere is a recent news that are the leaders of Russia and China have gotten\nTogether and boosted their newfound strategic a partnership I'm curious how you think about um you know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least the referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists in other countries respond by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action but I also have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we\nHave um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are very open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but\nYou mentioned that most people assume that job loss especially in manufacturing is due to you know trade issues whereas in fact technology is behind an awful lot of drop off and and we've discussed that on this program before we we discuss that\nWith I'm Christine Lagarde who who who made the point that that perception or maybe misperception\nA ... was and remains really a big part of a lot of the political movements or in Europe and elsewhere including Brexit\nAs you've mentioned people like to look for the villain I'd like you to talk about Brexit for a moment I'd like to talk about what you feel a where the legitimate and maybe illegitimate factors that produced it\nAnd where the WTO stands on it now what you're trying to accomplish\nThe first thing to say about a Brexit in particular is that it tends to be bunch together with all of these other a phenomenon that you see happening in the world are particularly in terms of protectionism um and I would say Brexit is\nSomewhat different rex it was more a child of\nA migration policies and sovereignty issues uh\nOr are these things are difficult to quantify but I Would say they played a much bigger role than any kind of tension introduced by by trade\nSo that's the distinction I Would say Brexit again is part of this transformative structural changes that we see out there a lot of ... a very significant part of the population feels left behind\nAnd they feel that somebody has to look at me I had something has to happen and nobody's doing that it was more like a ... going to vote\nThan a vote for a certain political alternative\nIt was more the kind of vote off no more we need to change and people had better listen rather than having a clear a wealth formulated agenda for either social political policies\nSo as everyone knows predicting the future of economics and politics and so on is really hard um to me one of the least predicted developments\nUm that very much affect global trade is the rise of the U.S as an oil exporter so it's estimated that next year the U.S will surpass Saudi Arabia to become the number one exporter in the world in large part because of fracking and other technologies\nI'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this considering that importing oil has for so long been a major part of not only the U.S economy but also us political concerned\nI think it will change things considerably even in terms of geopolitics um and I would say that what we're seeing this phenomena that we're seeing with the uh uh shale oil is just the tip of the iceberg\nEvery a scientist every economist that has been digging into this uh tells me that we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in the energy field\nAnd that uh the cost of energy may go down very very significant lead and that includes a electric energy so for example the combustion engine for the automobile industry some say is in the last stages I I don't know my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that\nFar [laughter] the economist I'm In law professor ... Bhagwati at Columbia has said this about the world trading system you said is characterized by a chaotic crisscrossing the preferences\nWith the plethora of different trade barriers applying to products depending on which countries they originate from this is a fool's way of doing trade\nOr it sounds as though you largely agree that uh that we get to where we get through a strange brew of evolution and history and best efforts and things changing over time so let me just leave you with this final question\nIf you as director general of the WTO had for a day or week some kind of magic wand [laughter]\nTo make things more equitable I'm more transparent tell me a few things that you would do to help make a little bit more order and equity out of this chaos I think the\nBiggest a challenge for us is to have a conversation I Would try to make sure that we give space for more discussions whenever you said if if the two sides or three or four or how many sides a want a solution a\nSolution will come I Will give you one anecdote something that happened with me actually\nI was at it and go shooting table and we all had very significant political problems at home right and we were struggling with the language of a provision was very important provision ah for everyone\nAnd in the middle of the conversation I'm somebody said why don't we write this down like this and he gave up you know he'd drafted\nA sentence and I said\nWhat what the hell does that mean I don't understand the ... and the others said I don't either and nobody understood descent that says okay so that's that states [laughter]\nNobody knew what he meant it but it it works for everyone precisely because nobody knew what it meant and then we got an agreement so when\nYou want things done you can find a way but you have to sit down and be determined that you want to solution\nAnd I appreciate the call for conversation I assume if President Trump were to hear this conversation\nAnd call you um you'd be happy to to go visit and try to sit down and works and things out yet\nI'm always available and I'm always\nComing up next on freakonomics radio here's what we typically hear about the relationship between government and economic growth\nMy God the government what a basket case the fear that they don't know what\nThey're doing today will hear an alternate take on that argument from the economists Mary on them out to answer more episodes like this one check out our podcast archive on deter or re comics dot com real also find our books the blog\nMuch more freakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart upon cast on change makers and the projects they're chanting in communities nationwide future and hard and they outlined apple ... cats are found\nCan you need support a public radio families he often they said K U T Ninety point five I memorized the part of a nonprofit organization that off as regular volunteer opportunities we'd like to hear about it email your information to laugh at PSA Katie that Oric in thank you\n[laughter]\n[noise] it's actually it's politics is a phrase has long been used to refer to potential political power the span of voter\nPerhaps you've heard of the sleeping giant you know that that the sleeping giant is incorrect metaphor rethinking the fastest growing segment of would be Texas voters the story on the next ...
