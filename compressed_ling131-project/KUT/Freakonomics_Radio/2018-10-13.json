are good they are often hard won but that is not the only battle that you need to fight you needed then fight a second battle which involves actually breathing life into those rules making them concrete and real for people\nSomething about law and lawyers has gone wrong\nWe lawyers are usually expensive first of all and we tend to focus on formal court channels that are impractical for many of the problems people face worse our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity\nLet me come back to ... twenty Thirteen he\nDid reach the gate so that factory with a bucket of pets will then his hands but he was arrested before he could follow through\nThen two years later he met someone I'm going to call them push push is part of a team of community as equals that works for environmental justice on the east coast Kush explains that Ravi that there was a law on his side\nWho is translated into ... something Ravi had never seen it's called the consent to operate it issued by the state government and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions\nSo together they compared the legal requirements with reality they collected evidence and they drafted in application not to the courts but to to administrative institution the pollution control board and the district administration\nThose applications started turning the creaky wheels of enforcement\nPollution officer came for state inspection and after that the company started running an air filtration system it was supposed to have been using all the law it also started covering the one hundred trucks they come and go from that plant every day\nThose two measures reduced the air pollution considerably the case is far from over ... learning and using law gave levy hope there are people like Kush walking alongside people like Ravi in many places\nToday I work with a group called number the number the helped convene a global network dedicated to legal empowerment altogether we are over a thousand organization in a hundred and twenty country collectively we deployed tens of thousands of community barely ... ... ...\nMean it seems to me that this idea of of of helping to establish community paralegals can really\nMake change at scale at at at a big scale is just to create more and more and more and more of them like all over the world basically people who are not lawyers but that are just as good as lawyers in terms of how they understand the law I Do think that that's part of what we need to do to achieve this transformation\nIn the relationship between la and people is to open it up and to embrace the role of these sorts of intermediary players I mean in healthcare for example we we never would think that all you needed doctors have a whole network of people you have doctors nurses midwives luck with your community health workers\nAnd so the folks that we we focus on and we we work with are sort of the equivalent of community health workers comp community legal workers and they can play this vital bridge role um even in some of the toughest circumstances\nWhen people know invoke the rules [noise]\nThey can get traction some of the time not not that we went every time but they can get they can get traction in in in in really powerful ways\nI see the beginnings of a real movement but we're nowhere near what's necessary not yet\nIn most countries around the world governments do not provide a single dollar of support for paralegals like push most governments don't even recognize the wool paralegals play or protect paralegals from heart\nI also don't want to give you the impression that paralegals and their clients when every time\nNot at all that cement factory behind levies village it's been turning off the filtration system at night when at least likely that the company would get caught [noise]\nRunning that filter costs money Ravi what steps photos of the polluted nice guy but he says the air is still unreasonable\nTrying to squeeze justice at a broken system is like Rob these case hope and despair or neck in neck\nAnd so not only do we urgently need to support and protect the work of beer for lawyers around the world\nWe need to change the systems themselves\nThat must be so many examples in cases that you come across where it's just you don't when\nYou do you do you face\nThese enormous odds and you face enormous forces and they and even though ... says on your side and you don't win\nHow do you how do you stay optimistic about this\nI don't think there's another option I ... you know we we take inspiration from the kinds of long term movements that have managed to change things in various places whether it's the\nSouth African freedom struggle um or whether it's the struggle for freedom here in the United states it takes time it takes patients who takes perseverance takes creativity and um those are qualities that I see in the paralegals we work with\nAnd watching them gives me hope yeah equip the people themselves to make those institutions more accountable more fair\nDon't give up on democracy forge a deeper version of democracy in which was something that

cities cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing in the city itself would decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city\nAs it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic unholy and predicted rise\nIn ... happening here in America and all over the world one problem many of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and it's not so easy to retrofit an entire city\nAt least in the eyes of economists nearly always a terrible idea that they create perverse incentives and they lead to dilapidated housing stock and so on on the other hand I'm your administrator and promoted this somewhat more market based eighty twenty solution a market level versus a subsidized\nAnd that seems to sort of it should be working but not anywhere near to the satisfaction of affordable housing advocates\nIf you look at what I'd call success city cities that where there's a lot of demand in the population is growing which I by the way they think is the mark of a successful city I knew detracting customers people wanna come\nThe question that I think you posed this how do you actually manage supply and demand more effectively you want more people to come I don't think you want to have slow that down because cities can either go to ways they can go up or they can go down and you're not smart enough to ever manage it\nSo that you can kind of keep things completely and balance so it really becomes a question of how do you produce more supply\nAnd there's really only two things that you need in order to do that you need a land for people to build on and you need money in order to subsidize it for people at all income levels\nWe saw that right from the very beginning of the Bloomberg administration we believe the city was going to grow and that's why at a time when we had no money we created what was to become an eight billion dollar\nAffordable housing program that produced a hundred and sixty five thousand units of affordable housing which basically means subsidized housing [noise]\nThe question is that when you look back on it did we do enough and the answer is no we let demand get out ahead of supply\nIt was really a market timing issue and what what ended up happening\nWas we were keeping things more or less in balance for the first five or six years of the Bloomberg administration we were ... and the growth the prices weren't going up that dramatically homelessness in fact we're starting to come down\nThen what happened was the financial crisis\nThe city actually in part because a lot of the other economic development initiative bounced back dramatically faster than ordinarily would have been the case in fact the city recovered faster than the national average for the first time following a financial panic crisis or bust\nYet when you have a financial crisis financing largely slow ... grinds to a halt and so there was a big pause in terms of the production of affordable housing and that I think when supply and demand got out of whack\nAs someone who's been in business a lot before and after your political time how I guess grubby or corrupt door unworkable is politics compared to business in\nYork City the amount of so called grogginess was I think minimal pretty much the only times that we had real problems with certain exceptions to this was when somebody from the state legislature actually gotten involved\nYou know a good story of of robbing us as we decide to re zone the waterfront in Brooklyn\nAfter World War two New York city literally lost almost all of its manufacturing and so the waterfront which had these spectacular views of Manhattan across the river had essentially been abandoned so it was\nYou know dilapidated war herbs and warehouses and factories and so we decided we were going to turn it into you know one of the more desirable parts of New York fit for sort of eight twenty first century economy\nSo uh we worked on this re zoning for about two years this was while I was bidding for the Olympics I literally on the day before\nFor the vote in the city council I arrived back from Korea where I was you know lobbying for votes\nAnd I called in the city hall because there was a snack in our ... zoning it turns out that the state representative you know veto Lopez from the district\nHad his hand out and what he wanted was a million dollars for a daycare center that I think his girlfriend had some involvement and\nAnd I literally after midnight called the head of the agency that oversaw sort of daycare centers woke him up in the middle of the night I never actually talked to him before I said you know you don't know me but I Need a favor\nCan I count on you for the million dollars for this day care center he said gras goalie yes and we got the deal done yeah sometimes there are just like insurmountable obstacles they usually occurred at the state level the politics there really can be awful\nAt one point I think the New York times counted up and something like thirty five legislators had been convicted of various crimes that included um the speaker\nOf the state assembly as well as the Senate majority leader\nAnd let's not forget governors Eliot Spitzer of course\nWe had our gets bits are too um and so we try to avoid the state honestly as much as possible but sometimes we just couldn't avoid them a good example of that was\nThe stadium on the west side of Manhattan is part of the Olympic bed and as part of the Hudson Yards plan we propose a stadium over part of the rail yards that are on the west side\nAnd you know we just couldn't find a way to get around the state legislature and eventually this really one guy who was the speaker of the assembly who's been convicted of corruption\nBlocked it without a vote and did it for lots of reasons none of which I'm sure we'll ever know including the fact that he had a cozy relationship with Madison Square garden which opposed it I mean it was sort of went on and on and on\n\nComing up after the break what cities should and should not do to keep corporations happy\nProviding these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nCity officials can

freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration to help New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today\n[noise] one of his project at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr ... is chairman of president\nShed I was just curious about the the why\n... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a performing arts beans at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line the second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nBut what's actually happening and comes back to some of the conversation we're having earlier is because it's growing so fast there are increasing pressure is on affordability on mobility and how people get around all of that is pushing middle income and lower middle and lower income people out from\nKind of access to employment uh which is creating opportunity challenges\nThere so committed to this notion of inclusion but ironically because that openness has produced the pressures that are making it harder to be inclusive they're very open to new approaches\nAnd so we want to create a place um ultimately of large scale\nThat can be a laboratory for innovation across sort of every urban system including mobility um sustainability building form and design public space and then even community and social services which we leverage technology to\nFundamentally bend the curve on a lot of those quality of life metrics\nWhen you say create a space just to be clear you're talking about this is essentially a physical neighborhood you're building correct we think of it as a district and can you just talk about what would be the most overt I guess futuristic elements of the construction\nOf this area for instance I assume that a lot of functions that are currently above ground and a lot of cities like ... delivery in trash disposal those will not be above ground\nAll of that is true but I think the thing that will have the most profound impact is if you don't allow traditional vehicles particularly automobiles into the district\nSo it's all autonomous um summoned vehicles and essentially yes\nBats are and and ideally much more shared than they are today\nSo if you begin to do that the consequences are cruelly profound than a typical North American city thirty to forty percent of the land um is dedicated to parking or the separation of roadways that these\nHighly dangerous vehicles demand if you begin to carve most of that back you can create greater density you can also however dramatically increase the amount of public open space\nIf you can begin to put people very close to open space and you can figure out ways to weather rise that particularly in places like Toronto where the weather is not so nice a large percentage of the time\nThen maybe you can begin to re conceive space in people's apartments in New ways which will also be enhanced by\nEnabling people to store a lot of their stuff off site because with autonomous delivery it'll be much easier and convenient and you combine that with new approaches to construction like modular construction or perhaps cross laminated timber\nThen you can begin demeaning flee lower the cost of housing you combined the lowering the cost of housing with lowering the cost of mobility which we believe is really possible by as much as fifty percent and you can begin to see cost of living decreases that are\nMeaningfully end of the double digits\nKnow the people who live there as I understand it are opting in to a program to have a great deal of their personal data gathered because this is a laboratory and you want to learn as much as you can from the day to help people move around and communicate and so on\nOne interview you gave you said that the data really shouldn't be used to be commercialized but um but this is a project run by funded by a company Google for whom commercializing data is it's actual business models so\nWhy on earth would we think that these data won't be commercialized and why on earth should we think that this entire project is just an extension of Google's Artie monolithic reach\nWe're just going to have to demonstrate to people through agreements engagement um specific actions that that's not our intent at all and by the way it's not Google or alphabet some time at all either our purpose here is to demonstrate how\nThat combination of innovation and urban design can fundamentally bend the curve on quality of life and to extent data gets use it's going to get used for those purposes but we have to prove it to people and memorialize that in different ways and that we will do so we understand the\nSkepticism and we will satisfy people over the course of two thousand and Eighteen which has our year to really put the plan together including privacy and data protection plans of our intentions\nSo yeah I mean look I Believe in something I call the virtuous cycle and successful city\nYou know the object of a city should be to grow and that is grow the number of residents grow the number of jobs grow the number of visitors because the marginal revenue of those additional people is greater than the marginal cost and that you can take that net profit\nIf you will and reinvest it back in quality of life in the city and affordable housing and education and safety and social services and when you do that and you improve quality of life more people calm perpetuating the virtuous\nWhen can I moved there [laughter]\nWell if all goes well [noise] you know the first people to probably move in and maybe five years or so but then that would be a place to proto type a lot of the interesting ideas and
