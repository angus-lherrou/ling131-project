I I decided to do it and I go in the cabin I came here yeah and that's a very useful to distinguish these different kinds of ... of actions but it doesn't mean that the experience of relation\nCaused the action and it doesn't mean that the national behavior doesn't exist of course it's a thing and every action that we experience is voting tree is shaped by a whole history of previous violent reactions um that we've\nExecuted during our lifetimes about social and cultural context of a developmental and and even our evolutionary heritage indeed do all of these factors play in to every action that we do whether we experience it as ... well not\nSo interesting about consciousness disease that's what makes us us right like like that's what makes us human but there are a lot of people in the world who who believe that we are not that far off from like AI becoming conscious right and and behaving in responding thinking as we do\nThat's right I mean but I think that belief is driven by a couple of factors one factor is just this this cultural a phenomenon ... we've had this throughout culture of of robots developing intelligence and then becoming conscious ... and we see this for me just reduce the time and I said we see this Blade Runner\nI'm In very different ways you know I Love Blade Runner I'm a bit frustrated by the ... view of\nA future technology and write books we see this in a beautiful film acts Mac and which I think really interrogate this is the ... issues behind this\nIn a huge interesting way but yeah that's this cultural trucks that intelligence and consciousness go together and that I Will develop awareness at some point um the other factor that's playing into it and this is the one I think is perhaps a bit more\nDamaging is what I come to a quarter punishes on ... and this isn't the idea that we ... we say well what's special about as we were trying to find out what's special about us maybe it's not that we have a soul and other animals die\nWell maybe it's that we're intelligent maybe we have minded is somehow different an order of magnitude different from the minds of other creatures or or of objects its intelligence that set says ... makes a special and we're conscious\nSo that is this tendency we have to associate these two things together like well you know we're intelligent\nAnd we're conscious so intelligence and consciousness should go together\nBut actually that really doesn't have to be the case you certainly don't have to be very intelligent in order to experience pain and suffering and so we can imagine that that's plenty of\nOther animals that may not school very highly you know a very human centric measure of intelligence but nonetheless have they've been conscious experiences\nSo to me these things why against the idea that that hey I is headed on an ... tree towards being conscious but yeah certainly possible that the near future we'll see as being able to build up to facts that gives the impression\nOf being conscious and that to me pick Saturday very interesting especially the future what will happen to our interactions with each other and with other animals when our environment so what can I can buy things that give the appearance\nOf being conscious of being intelligent but for which we have no way really of knowing whether they are not sending their confidence in saying that they are conscious [noise] is that going to change the way we do have the things that are actually conscious ...\nI think that definitely aware\nAnd I'll say he's a professor of neuroscience at the university sex you can see his full talk dot com [noise]\nThinks listening to our show this week what makes us [laughter] I [laughter] if you want to find out more about he was on it but it had that NPR dot O.

J. reading and it was played in the NBA since two thousand six\nHe could never shoot basketball the way that I could but he could hit a baseball in mile had a cannon for an arm my best friend from high school was the same way you know certain kids are just everything's sort of comes easy to them and it's natural them\nI have seen some of the most physically gifted and talented gymnasts I think our sport has ever seen Shawn Johnson again she now coaches young gymnasts but they just do not have been the capability to to get in south that elite level and it's\nNot a matter of training them or you know getting them to the right for psychology start getting the right people around them it's just it's not there so I think you have to be born with some sort of as innate ability to you know ... all pain and\nAnd the ocean and push yourself past the boundary that Ninety nine percent of the world operates with and\nI remember being in an apartment we lived in in Indianapolis Dominique Fox worse again and I told my father I wanted to be a professional football player he was eight years old and he told me All right well you set a goal you should do something to get you closer to go every day\nAnd I took that to heart so I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was throwing up it's like ridiculous\nWas it the gay Fox worth such an intense drive for football\nI was in love with the game in part because of how violent it was honestly I like whatever warped sense of masculinity I had at that age that probably has not fully left me with like basketball as for the soft kids football is for the men and I want to play football [noise]\nSo yeah most of the athletes we've heard from were extraordinarily driven and talented but of course they've also had to work incredibly hard at protecting their craft [noise]\nMost of them at least remember Donald Thomas our high jumping friends\nEven if dean interviewed Thomas's college track coach and they said they would usually find him like outside you know free throws when he was supposed to be inside learning how to high jump most athletes however do train incredibly hard in part because they're not allowed not to\nBuy coaches are teens maybe their parents but of course they also push themselves\nI think it's about how much you want it how much you love it and how much you're willing to sacrifice for\nMike ... is a rookie offensive lineman on the San Francisco forty niners he was in ninth player chosen in this year's draft\nI was never the best athlete on my team I was I'm I'm Still not the best athlete on my on my team\nHere um but I've always wanted it more I've always worked harder than everybody else and I'm I'm just attention to detail and the things that you need to know how to self correct you need to know how to learn\nKnowing how to learn is particularly valuable when the skills you're trying to learn our unusual\nPlayoff of divine as one of the more on natural human movements on earth and for I think um you're required to move other large man out of the way and\nTrying to stop them and passed protection you're completely moving backwards so it's a really really different thing to have to learn how to do\nAnd uh until your\nBody can feel it until you can watch it on film and self diagnosed right when things happen and that's where the separation comes and\nThere's also the fact that the training opportunities and some sports are inherently constrained\nScary thing is a really unique sport in many ways to kill us different when you think about it the actual time that I stand or any race there spend\nOn the hill actually skiing during the day of training let's say you get one course length is about sixty seconds long and you get seven runs in one training session and that takes about somewhere between three\nTo five hours depending on how long the ... the you're adding up about seven minutes total of practice and your support for the entire training session which is comparative to say three to five hours of somebody playing tennis in a single session\nWhich makes me feel like the deliberate practice component is that much more central\nYou know there's gears out their teammates of mine in the past\nTo spend their time from the top of the chair left to the top of the race course it could be half trail links and that they're skiing down and they're just kind of like flailing about and doing whatever and I was like doing drills to the top of the course\nTrying to make use of every square inch is based on the mountain every time I'm deliberately practicing skiing and my technique and everything then I'm kind of getting a one up on everybody else who's not\nBecause it's so demanding to master the skill set that accompany each sport whether it's skiing or swimming or football you can imagine an aspiring athlete would want to spend as much time as possible on that skill set and not waste time on say other sports\nThis has become a huge debate in youth sports at what age should an athlete stop playing other sports and commit to there's a lot of young athletes and especially their parents seem to think the best move is to pick your sport early and focus solely on that sport\nMan it drives me nutty Kerry Welsh Jennings\nIt's just I think it's such a ... odd place to come from ... anything\nI'm let alone when you're a child and you're eight years old you do not need to pick your sport that you're going to maybe get a college scholarship for you know and play three sixty five twenty four seven which is mentally and spiritually and physically just it'll crush you\nSo I have a major problem with the way things are right now and I absolutely know that I and a great athlete because I did everything growing\nAnd I wanted to be a great athlete\nYeah I was never that child that turned ten years old and said oh my gosh I Need to give up everything and everyone ingests commit my life the Olympics\nThe gymnast Shawn Johnson\nI had this you know blue collar family all American Midwest just kind of parents that wanted me to be normal and they pushed me to be in so many sports and some of the activities and\nUm try the oboe and clarinet and piano practice and\nMock trial and all these things that kind of distracted makes them to sell in the rain that always gave me this perspective of I Love everything but I Love gymnastics more and so whenever I was ... I focused more than any other activity and gave more effort air because I knew that was my favorite\nThere is some research to back up these stories from Johnson and waltz Jennings\nSo for example after the last World Cup a group of German scientists\nUm published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany that's David obscene and he's talking about the two thousand fourteen World Cup and found that the athletes who went on to the national team which by the way one that World Cup\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athletes who plateaued at lower levels so this sort of less structured\nDevelopment [noise] um and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become the [noise]\nOkay but what if you are a young athlete or the parents have one in your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athlete but rather to get into and Lee University [noise] like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nNo I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ...\nMy freakonomics friend and coauthor he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about ... four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools have so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I I catch that thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that's a crazy like this college fencing even exist and and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools\nThat have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave affected the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's male female factory\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nAdd it all up David Canton says and this explains the huge decline of African Americans in baseball which by the way it's been countered by huge rise in players from Latin America that said major league baseball is well aware of and concerned by the drop off in African American players\nShould we have um a league called the RBI league which is reviving baseball and the inner cities\nThat Kim and major league baseball senior vice president of international baseball development\nSo um we've seen academies develop\nIn Kansas City in Philadelphia New Orleans\nOr Washington DC that leaves academies are really providing opportunities for young kids yeah particularly of color to come and train with us free of charge of course and it really honing their skills\nYou could argue that sports are among the most married a credit endeavors and humans do long after all when you're measuring outcomes with\nStomp on your yards by whether the ball goes in the network doesn't you'd think that an athlete's background where they come from they looked like it wouldn't matter much but sometimes the professional sports teams and particularly often have very conservative mindset\nThey tend to go looking for players\nBut a lot like the previous players which means they might overlook someone ... should not have been over\n\nIn two thousand twelve the New York Knicks went on a nine three winning streak sparked by any obscure young point guard seemed Jeremy [noise]\nDuring\nThis whole game stretch Lynn average twenty two and a half points an eight point seven assist if you don't know basketball numbers but those are good ones Lin's success so dramatic so unpredictable that it produced moving [noise]\nWe grew up in California to parents who immigrated from Taiwan\nEven though we put up great numbers in high school he received no athletic scholarship offers to college he wound up playing at Harvard while studying economics once again he put a great basketball numbers but when it came time for the NBA draft Jeremy Lin's name was not called\nThe Golden State warriors signed him as an ... drafted free agent making him the first American a Taiwanese or Chinese descent to play in the NBA but he barely played and three times a year the warriors send them down to their minor league club\nDuring the NBA's off season he played a few games in China\nThen the Knicks signed him and when sanity broke out\nIn\nIs now in his ninth year in the NBA he's in the final season of a three year deal worth thirty eight point three million dollars how could someone worth nearly Thirteen million dollars a year had been assigned a value of essentially zero\nLet's ask one of the people who did take an early look at Jeremy Lin Darryl more general manager of the Houston Rockets the rockets have been one of the winningest team in basketball during mores tenure and he was just named NBA executive of the year\nMore he was also one of the first executives in basketball to make extensive use of analytics help shoes players so I asked him why Jeremy Lin's college numbers had not lit up his model\nWell and one thing that was talking about Germany 'cause he did actually producing college at a level that look you know insanely well I'm meaning if he had played at say a\nKentucky or Duke or whatever for sure he would have been a top pick in the draft I have no doubt that the problem was he played at Harvard a and actually most of the models that are used from an analytics perspective to forecast draft picks they're built on people who are drafted\nAnd Germany didn't look like anyone who was drafted the number of Ivy League players that have become MBA players is\nExtremely small so one of the things you have to be careful bows analytics is when did not use things um and I incorrectly chose to not weights uh his time and I really high enough and we he ended up\nGoing under after Maury and the rockets did however Greenland into training camp as an drafted rookie actually did look quite good in our training camp but\nUnfortunately at that time in four point guards and so yeah we way either incorrectly let him go\nWell what about his being Asian how much did that just you know the fact that he did not quote look lake what most basketball people think a good basketball player looks like and how much that may have actually obscured the the the real data\nTo sort of it I Know the question but the the founders of behavioral science you know a lot of their research was on yeah how people mostly unconsciously some time so\nOverly put people into you know you know basically buckets a or categories and then use those for making decisions and often those serious six really serve you well in life I e you know I I've categorize that animal is dangerous and song Lloyd them so they don't eat me right\nBut many times they don't serve you well and and a while you're asking\nIs the question it's impossible to answer is basically how did\nAh Germany's heritage or change how he was viewed by\nNBA talented value waiters um but I don't know how much Rosa Ivy League how much it was you know um yeah no nobody knows the reality was it happens you're not just in the NBA had happened to consistently he was\nA top player in high school he didn't got literally almost no interest from college had coaches but he should have been recruited by the Duke and the Kentucky ... and then again he was overlooked in the NBA no one can really know why but there's obviously a bunch of factors that probably played a role\n...\nThe more you talk to athletes\nAnd the people around them\nThe more you realize that the path to elite status isn't nearly as predictable as you might imagine there are cognitive biases involved there's personality politics and remember luck cleanly there's no guarantee that the given an athlete will get the right opportunity to make it to the top but\nAbout if you do get the opportunity\nThat when the real challenge begins now you've got to work even harder to vote yourself even more completely and that comes with the cost it's the flip side of opportunity in what economists call\nOpportunity costs meeting for every hour you spend on your sport\nYou surrendered our or something\nFor every opportunity the sport gives you there's another opportunity you have to sacrifice\nSo fighting takes up a lot of time and um you know fighters they have to diet pretty hard\nLauren Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the fight weight division of USC\nBack to work out all the time they need to rest a lot of us work so they're just not a lot of time in the day and a lot of times the first thing that\nKind of get taken off the plate is time with family\nAnd so I remember missing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners and you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family\nKind of being like what the hell [laughter] if I you know why are you suddenly neglecting not so much and ah [noise] I I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nThe high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share I didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing football baseball\nYou know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know ah\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominique Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nMen in college I wanted to ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that back ... going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies yeah and it American studies when I was ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter]\nNo I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I fail to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you have given up during the course of your life",
