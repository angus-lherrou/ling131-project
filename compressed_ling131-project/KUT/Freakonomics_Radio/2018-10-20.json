I see one pretty significant problem with how what's the problem the juicy gross ...\nAh yeah that's that's the thing that comes to mind most often and em if you're retake its very serious and you look at an insect you take a\nOr crickets and you take away their wings and the the legs and then you put that next to 'em an ice shrimp if you look at them they're they're basically the same and even from a biological point of view they're very close relatives and so if you love to eat shrimp\nThen why would you enough left to its um locus which in some countries eased learn all the the the sky shrimp\nI mean I still want to make this work in my life and then the lives of the people listening but [laughter] but\nI Can't even I Try to be mindful and imagining\nBiting into a lot of gas in the chest I Can't get there\nWell then that for you at this stage it might be an alternative to eat pasta in which the crickets having grown up and and there are distributed into the pasta and so you want to hear anything out again it's a fortified specify with cricket meal\nI understand that it takes a while to sort of get over it is that's when the first sushi wasn't being on the markets in the United states eating raw fish was not something well accepted now you can eat sushi anywhere\nYeah so there's all kinds of foods that maybe initially might not have the author's rights but still make it\nSo if if actually you know let's say we can get over to sort of cultural or version and the last two or eating lots of insects and and like I just ate so many insects that really reduced our consumption of chicken and beef and pork and you know lamb what would happen\nI think we would have a world population that would be able to sustain every one way of animal proteins and ideally be also so that we would eat less meat but it would be good if we at least for ... part of it's a new meats and with this I think what we would see is that our dinner table\nWould be much more diverse you are and I think you shouldn't because as her to overcome this gross for no how can we make life even more enjoyable by having a more variety or what [noise]\nUh\nMy ... he's the head of the laboratory of entomology at wanna try this ending in university and the Netherlands you can see his entire\nTalk at ... dot com\nBecause of the the sort of my favorite tasting food\nI'm not fasting jobs like a dog going turkey and just you just said it sounds like\nNot selling them sit back\nListen to them it\nCan be at the\nThat feels\nThey listen to a show about food this week if you want to find out more about who was on it go that had that NPR dot org see hundreds more tax check out head dot com or the head at\nOur production staff at NPR includes Jeff Rogers rent Bachmann making came even grant some as Michigan for Casey Herman and Rachel soccer with help from Daniel should get our intern is Camilo gosh on our partners at head Chris Henderson Kelly ...\nAnd Janet Leigh I'm Guy rise and you've been listening to ideas were spreading right here on the Ted radio hour from NPR\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the allies you crack family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey you logic correct bart's town Kentucky forty seven percent alcohol by volume Eliza Craig promotes responsible drinking\nFrom Viking dedicated to bringing the traveler closer to the destination Vikings new custom built ocean fleet offers a small ship experience with all of around a state rooms ensure excursions and every port Viking Cruises dot com\nAnd from the listeners his support this NPR station ...\nNPR station K.

I decided that Barry Lynn and I had to part ways because he could not work\nRespectfully honestly and cooperatively with his colleagues\nSo slaughter says she got rid of Lynn not because of the funding conflict of interest but because he was a difficult employee I don't actually think this is just a think\nTank issue I worked at a major\nUniversity three universities and universities are have private funders for centers and for different bodies of research and you know I think even newspapers have constant tensions between advertisers and reporters that reporters don't have to navigate\nBut the management does I think there is a general tension wherever you need to protect the integrity\nOf research and\nYou also need to fund that research you America Says all its major funders are listed on its website we ask thought or for a breakdown\nOnly twelve percent comes from corporations are the rest comes from foundations by far the largest amount comes from foundations and then from private individuals\nTaking corporate money does not mean necessarily that the work of the entire institution is suspect Barry Lynn again\nBut it definitely can create a slippery slope that will lead to pressures being brought to bear on those people who are questioning concentrations of power or the use of corporate power and other ways\nI think people are right to have a kind of skeptical maybe cynical orientation to what was called corporate lobbying or corporate philanthropy\nAnd that's Robert reach a political scientist at Stanford he's written a new book called just giving why philanthropies failing democracy and how it can do better\nMy research interest these days focus a great deal on philanthropy and the ... plays in democratic societies\nAnd that philanthropy increasingly comes in the form of foundation [noise]\nThere are lots of foundations\nWhat is the medium size of assets it's really small right a million or so dollars so yeah it's not much that it maybe a couple of million dollars but there is enormous growth in the number of foundations and that's just the kind of logical consequence of growing inequality and in the United states just talk about\nYour thesis essentially the role The Influencing the complications around modern philanthropies\nI'd start by saying most people's attitude about philanthropists and the ... foundation says that we should be grateful that people are trying to do good with their with their own money\nAnd that's the attitude I Want to try to sweep away I don't think philanthropists deserve that amount of charity if you will why is that because ... especially large philanthropy in the form of a foundation or especially wealthy person\nRepresents the exercise of power which they attempt to use their own private wealth to affect public outcomes or to produce public benefits or make social change\nAnd power deserve scrutiny in a democratic society not gratitude I'd add on top of that the foundation in particular which\nIs a a a legal form that allows a wealthy person to create a donor directed unaccountable fairly transparent perpetual and tax subsidized corporate\nFarm in order to use their private assets to affect the public uh me is uh especially um interesting and potentially worrisome form of power let's talk\nAbout think tanks per se um is there such a thing as a truly nonpartisan think tank or is it just too hard because of where the money's coming from\n[noise] [noise] well\nI I'd say that you're more likely to make the case that there are a non partisan universities or universities which are funded in not entirely dissimilar ways from think tanks I'm a well officially they have to be nonpartisan so so do you think tanks to in other words they can't declare themselves in favor of particular political candidates\nBut think tanks have become far more popular in the United states as a result of the polarization and inequality United States so that the idea generation that happens in think tanks and the policy framework some proposals that gets disseminated from think tanks\nFlow from philanthropic interests with particular policy positions in mind\nTell me what you know about Google's history of philanthropic or foundation or think tank giving and especially the timeline because I understand that accelerated quite a bit recently\nYeah so Google like lots of other tech firms has gotten much more aggressive in its formal lobbying efforts and I think it's now the case that the\nTop five Silicon Valley companies are amongst the largest sources of lobbying um greater even than the five top Wall Street firms and I'm In New York\nAnd there's been a parallel wrapping up of the ... that's associated with the tech firms that find three comes in a variety of different forms\nSo Rob knowing what you know about the situation with the New America foundation and the Google money and the controversy what would your advice be for them for the New America foundation\nThe New America foundation needs to be aware of the soft power the agenda setting influence that donors can have\nTo the think tank even in the absence of calling someone up and saying we disagree or we object to the work that someone does\nSo when Ann Marie Slaughter whose job is chiefly to ensure the existence of of an American foundation into the future which involves fundraising\nDoes her work she needs to be cautious that she hasn't internalized the policy preferences of the donors such that she shapes the work of the foundation around the donor interests the idea is you're worried about the conversation you'll have with your donor in the future and so you orient the work that you do to please\nThe owner rather than to displace the donor and that has functionally the same outcome from the donors perspective without even having to say anything\nNow your own fine university Stanford benefited was founded from the large as to a private largest Superman leaving Stanford who\nYou know most of history paint him as a classic Robert bearing a railroad at the end who uh who did all kinds of stuff that we would frown upon today talk to me about that and whether that's a conversation that takes place regularly at Stanford or is it avoided\nSo I'd say people here are aware of the history of the university and a deep connection between philanthropy and the wellbeing of especially well the universities\nAre people here I think you know something about the history of Cleveland Stanford and ah so there is an effort on campus too on earth the sordid history\nOf the universities initial benefactor\nHas there been any movement of any kind of magnitude to rename the university\nNot that I Know of their starting with lower hanging fruit other\nMonuments and places on campus named for people with no obvious connection to the university and who's historical records are not so appealing\nSo let's say I have some money Rob name your figure and I want to set up a foundation ... ... and I come to you and I say you know I'm a big believer in bringing critics into the inner circle and I know that you've been critical of how\nFoundations have and that it's undemocratic and so on but you know Rob I'd like to make you the director my foundation the executive of my foundation and let's say I made my money in no\nAmmonia fertilizer how would you go about setting it up in a way that takes advantage of my largest to try to accomplish something that we could all agree some kind of public good without falling into all the traps that you've been describing to us\nSo at first I'd say despite the fact that laws don't require me to be especially transparent about what the foundation is doing I pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we do the evaluations of the grants that we make\nI Want to invite in outside experts as well and I would want to find ways in which to organize a foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we were doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a former foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic habits of corporations were purely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often in their philanthropy I'm trying to\nStimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks ought to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question\nOne they said that this is not too much but to see why the large effect if we take into account that the average time it takes to skip ... is about thirty five seconds\nThat is right for every missed shot you have to ski a small penalty loop\nSo this means that when ... at home and buy it loses so never edge four to six seconds\nAnd to put this number into perspective and donate the games in Sochi the home by at least dumped on shooting which by the way I really love his performance or he was only zero point seven seconds away from a bronze medal of ...\nBut what is skiing faster as what causes you to miss more shop\nSo one may is if you will that since the ski faster that have higher a heart rate and therefore they assume they mean smaller but the evidence they associate between heart rate and shooting performances mixed\nOkay so that doesn't seem to explain the worst shooting at home is there may be another explanation\nThe second this little nation is that usually they were from the shooting stars\nIn the very ... or they don't look around they don't care about anything but probably one of your performance home something good to\nBe starving rumor tells us that by athletes usually perform the shooting in a very automatic commander oh that sounds like it might be relevant to our choking discussion so what exactly does that mean\nBack to the psychologist see on ... we know that sometimes people don't perform up to their potential um precisely when they want to the most and sometimes that happens because people pay too much attention to the details of what they're doing\nDetails that should be left on auto pilot\nAt human performance lab by lock and her colleagues did an experiment with expert golfers and novices\nSo we set up a pet ingrained in our lab and when we tried to asked experts for their memories of how they'd taken apart they couldn't tell us so much about it the novices the people who are just learning could tell us way more\nAnd we thought wow this might be an indication that these high level coffers aren't paying so much attention to what they're doing\nAnd so one of the reasons that they might perform poorly under stress is when they start paying attention the way you've just put that would not be that surprising to anyone who follows let's say golf per se right it is true that um you know sometimes athletes have these these moments of feelings of being in his own but I think\nYou know we often don't think about this idea that paying too much attention could actually be counterproductive can share coaches yelling concentrate all the time\nAnd so being able to actually show that when you're at this high level you're not paying attention to the details and one of the reasons you mess up is because you start paying attention to those details allowed us to start asking questions about how we prevent you from paying attention to the details\nWhat is it that people actually or thinking about when they're doing boating\nAnders Ericson also did putting experiments in his lab at Florida State with somewhat different results\nThat we actually a store participants to think out loud and recruited skilled and less skilled individuals\nAnd what we found was that the skill individuals they were actually ... more about thoughts and basic factors that they were taking into account in order to actually decide how they were going to put the ... so their argument is that\nIf you're really skilled you're actually generating a rich description here of the situation so you're trying to take into account is your how basically the ball would roll and where do you need to aim in order to have the appropriate bowl path\nSo I Know that some psychologist argue that what separates the better performers the top tier performers from the rest of us is you know some form of auto ... right that you're going into some free flowing state that's dependent on all your talent and experience it cetera but you're not\nActually engaging in a cognitively you're saying that's not what you found\nWhat we're finding is that experts are able to make adjustments you know when they're performing so if you're a musician and the acoustics them in a given\nPerformance environment is different you can actually make adjustments in the same way that a soccer player you know when the situation changes they can actually make adjustments appropriate to the situation\nSo let me ask you this Anders to what degree do you believe that choking is the factor or a main factor that actually separates an absolute topped your performer from someone who's talented and so on but doesn't reach the top tier in other words is the expert is the professional\nThe very good performer who has learned to not joke\nMy experiences the choking is quite rare by those individuals that we study who are consistent flee excelling and it seems to be almost part of being an expert ... says you deal with the kind of situations that would be you know experience is very high pressure for other people [noise]\nThat's an interesting continuum\nHigh pressure performances can lead to choking bug expert performers who could be under pressure all the time tend to not show [noise]\nOf course it does happen\nFor me it was terrifying\nJeremy Abbott was one of the best figure skaters in the world he won the U.S men's championship four times and went to the Olympics in two thousand ten in two thousand fourteen things didn't go so well at the Olympics opening where the ... right here [noise]\nNot all that together [noise]\nHard fall there this\nWho is unlike any other situation I'd ever been in all of my practice and all that my preparation\nUh once I got to the games everything really kind of leading up to that moment both Olympics in Vancouver and in Sochi I was really excited I could see the rings and the moment I went out uh in Vancouver and and so she\nEvery in security that I had about myself and about my skating which just magnified by a million I'm and I was just so focused on not\nWanting to make a mistake I was in the wrong mindset\nBoth times Abbott failed to metal in the individual events he retired from competitive skating in two thousand sixteen and you know coaches in Detroit he uses his own experience to help the next generation\nI should have been focusing less on outcome a and less on um performance and more just on the process and and getting my job done and ... and ... and accomplishing what I Do every single day in training and and really taking all of that experience\nA and all of that work\nAnd putting it to use rather than focusing on what is that what if this were a you know anything could happen um but whenever I get it my best it was never focusing on a placement or up a point total or\nPleasing somebody else it was always just OK I'm here and I'm going to do a job and that was one I always get it my best\n[noise] yeah that is actually the times when you do start thinking too much that you can fly for ... [noise] the on by luck again\nAnd so [noise] any situation that causes you to attend in ways that you might not normally can Mathew [noise]\nSo can I just say I love our species I think we're kind of awesome I mean we have some flaws and so on but doesn't it seem a like a weird counterbalance that we tend to choke most in circumstances as you've been telling us that matter the most to assume that just seem like a design flaw [laughter]\nUm it is interesting I mean I guess you could say that maybe we haven't adapted to those situations yet I mean there are we've certainly been in social situations for a long time but um\nOur level of self consciousness and and met a cognitive\nAbility the ability to know what we and others are thinking of something that probably fairly recent [noise] evolutionarily wise that we should probably take a look\nAt how we think differently and perform differently as the stakes ride\nWould have made me very nervous coming up\nRight after the freakonomics radio is supported by target presenting future at heart upon cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and cats or wherever pine cats are found\nFreakonomics radio is supported by the ... foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting progress in education in science and the arts information at ... foundation dot org\nSupport comes from precision heating and air family owned and operated here in central Texas offering twenty four seven service called sales and insulation from certified ac specialists with no subcontractors customer reviews of precision heat a C.\nDot com K.
