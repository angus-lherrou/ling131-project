mornings kind of is the first ... started to fill this guy in the morning like gunshot cracked off\nIt was rattling is scary and the bullet hit the wall Fifteen feet away so we all kinda got shower of Iraq fragments\nYou can't run away the port alleges are made of fabric on the bottom so you're half expecting bullets and it just revenue from the from the bottom up\nA second gunshot went off and at that point I could see that there is three people at the base of the class that we were on\nJohn Dickey the photographer he had a long camera lens that he put it on his camera and he looked down and he can see these scary looking guys I'm with the guns and they were there were waving to us to come down and so John went ahead and volunteered to go down first\nAnd then he almost immediately radio that to me and he said hey these guys\nAre they really like for you to come down and have a talk\nThey soon as I got to the ground was greeted by these are two gentlemen who were wearing camouflage clothing and one of them had of Patagonia Gore Tex jacket on\nAnd some really nice climbing sunglasses and he had a tube of Colgate and the Colgate toothbrush in as an of a pockets on his vast that he was actually quite proud of\nHis first thought was that these men were banned it but they didn't act like bandits they shook his hand and introduce themselves\nThere is a the commander who uh call himself Abdul there is the guy with the Gore Tex jacket and sunglasses who has called ... and he was just overtly friendly um he was grinning from ear to ear really happy to meet us\nThey they seem to have pretty chill attitudes but they had big guns [laughter] and so they're they're just basically like follow us\nDo about them back to the Base Camp the climate had just set up a few days earlier they watched as\nA handful of armed men were rifling through their supplies\n... directed them to sit down next to another hostage and then into military uniform they recognized as the cookies officer related issues there travel permit\nI didn't and immediately or register that in fact um because when he stood up to make room for me to sit on his Rob\nI'm I noticed that he was covered from the waist down and blood he was completely saturated\nStarted pointing to the blood on his yeah [noise] yeah it was it was\nThe curies office his name was ... and he was signaling to them secretly that these kidnappers had already killed three other tricks\nThink he saw the look on my face which was probably action\nAny held up three fingers and many he swiped one finger across as throw\nIt seemed as if a blues men were not cookies [noise] there was some kind of militant rebel and they were preparing to move the whole group somewhere else\nAnd if they want to move to somewhere that means they have to be somewhat kind to us we didn't have a lot of things that we were going to be able to exploit and that was one of them we can export cooperation our level of cooperation\nDoing his men broke down camp took all the supplies that could carry and began to march everyone at gunpoint over the racket terrain the climbers and the other hostage trot had no choice but to a bank and then suddenly above them\nThere was a new even deadly or threat\nCourteous helicopters military helicopters started fly around overhead and that's when\nEverything changed\nIt got really frantic in what had been\nA silent Himalayan valley just a few hours earlier a firefighter wrapped up till pointed up to the helicopter in mind go hide or we will shoot the to the hostages belly crossing the brush suddenly they were dodging bullets from every which way\nThe helicopter was shooting from above and more trees soldiers crusted hill and we're closing in on the residents who are also returning fire\nThere's a lot of machine gun fire that has this kind of things that started to fly\nThere was the murders and shoot it and you'd have this whistling noise and you'd hear it coming towards you and then there'd be an explosion [noise]\nUntil the hostage to the brush exacting from tree to tree they ran for our something down sharp steep gorges alongside fast moving river\nAnd so we kind of escape the um the line of sight of these soldiers um and we weren't running across as plateau to the adjacent valley truck came over and sat next to me and he put his hand on my knee any squeezed it really really tightly and he looked me right in the face and he pointed across as valley\nAnd he said I'm going to die over there and that kind of did that I think anybody would do which is to lie to him and to tell him that we were all in this situation together and everything going to be okay and\nUh he told me to shut up and he said listen to me I'm going to die over there and that means that you need to do something about the situation\nOnly moments later a blues men motion for the group to move behind a large Boulder up that Boulder where they were sold at us and told us he got one time in ... was the first one to go I'm so ... went up there and then as soon as he got there they shot him\nOne blanketing\nThe four of us um had to come up after that and sort of walk around the Boulder and see him lying there with the pool of blood coming out of his head and then we had to basically crouching lay on top of his body for the\nNext hour or two until we finally fled the thing that you know the battle [noise]\nAnd the adrenaline was starting to wear off we finally got up to this rich where [noise]\nUm we were able to stop and sit\nDown and\nWe had we had a break and there was kind of a very strange feeling the crossfire it was done helicopter was gone but their food water and supplies for also gone and so we ended up with just a few things in our pockets which I think there's a power bars or a three musketeers bar\nUp to his men scattered during the firefight\nNow there was only three men lashed Abdul himself to the shy one in a bear the friendly one\nOver at a few pieces of candy that he shared he pulled five of them out of pocket and you kind of looked around at the other people other than himself and you could see him during the math and he ended up taking one of the pieces and giving my friends that I the other four pieces\nAnd I think that for me that was the moment I knew that we could beat this if we just played our cards right\nOf dull had relaxed a little bit the climbers we're no longer at gunpoint and there was an unspoken agreement that everyone stay together that is until they came to the river\nReally fast raging river\nAnd they were having a hard time with it\nThey started trying to figure this\nJust fallen trees and and and get it across the river to make a bit of a bridge\nAnd Jason I'm decided to this moment that he was going to help them and I didn't understand why\nI swam and I'm like a cat and the water so I was actually terrified so I just committed I charged out there and I just grabbed\nThe log and [noise]\nPlowed into this raging torrent of water was like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the law\nAnd I got about three quarters of the way across and ah I ended up setting off the Boulder and funding into the main current and I was right on the top of a waterfall\nThought to myself like a nice for idiot because now you're going to have relatively drowned in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank and not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd ... over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employ them up in the rock and he was terrified and was rocking law [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection as to why I wanted as even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I are very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie any patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padded among the shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause that we were totally on their side\nNews to who they had all seen fall to his dad was alive\nAnd I said that's impossible that it's completely impossible [noise]\nUm I saw this guy ...\nAir in front of me and hit the ground and let out this horrible exploding found go tumbling off again [noise]\nJohn says the same as just as possible and then um he facts or a photograph of the army sent through that was clearly ... [noise] and yeah I Would have found it I'll never understand how are we survive\nI remember um being happy that he and died for sure but really what pay me more of that I you know I had the capacity I sort of had this like evil inside of me that allowed me to kill I think most people\nWonder um if they were put in a live or die situation like this would they be able to react and I did like I was able to react in a way that saved our lives and so that there's always been somewhat empowering but\nYou know I still didn't you know I didn't want to kill anybody I still would never want to kill anybody um so I was I was happy to do\nThat [noise] so Jason and John flew back to Kurdistan and they were actually granted the meeting with the cookies minister of defense\nSo\nSince the ministry of defense then right in front of me I just went out and threw it out there and said hey are you going to be able to ... visual name as Ruslan ...\nUm and then he said yeah sure I mean ...\nTen minutes from now than they ... into the room\nAnd she or he walked in the room and he saw it and he smiled and\nUh we had we\nHe gave us a big handshake and then we sat down and had a sort of brief an awkward\nConversation a missed the first time we've been able to talk with an interpreter and we apologize I said hey sorry about that whole like you know off the cliff kind of thing and I have to laugh when I said sorry about pushing them off the cliff any kind of shrugged his shoulders and smart cat I had done the same thing [noise]\nUm and I guess for me that was probably the most valuable part of that interaction and less valuable part to walk\nAway with it\nI knew that he was facing the death penalty for half a dozen different charges you know invading a foreign country taking people captive all the kinds of things\nAnd I felt really sorry for him he was a Nineteen year old car really had a real innocent kind of air about him I didn't want to say anything in front of the army that might contribute to him getting the death penalty why\nUh and then know\nUm it\nJust seems to me like that's how the circle of violence continues\n[noise] Mm [noise] [noise]\nThank you Jason Smith in Tommy Caldwell was sharing that story judgment Tommy are still climbing rocks around the world and writing about in\nThe ... more Jason's books and speaking of his website Jason singer Smith dot com Tommy's what the push is available right now wherever you get your books and\nLive here in movie buff checkup at dawn wall ...
