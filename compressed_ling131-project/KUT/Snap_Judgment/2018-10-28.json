guy who ran over on his bike in front of the funeral home\nSo people often just went in to see people they didn't have to know that when I was real common rooms\nAnd the people who ran the funeral home as soon as they knew that a lot of times we would go there just to get out of the heat but they had one kind of unwritten rules you couldn't come man unless you were interviewing\nCouldn't just be hanging uh you you could go interview in which meant that uh we had to sit\nCould look at a body we would do it we wouldn't want to read all done at so many times we knew the rules of the game\nTo\nHim about twelve years old when this story takes place and it was late summer\nIt was hot as hell probably one of the hottest days of our guys\nAnd we all piled into their own I actually just finished playing tee ball outside it\nWas unusual about that is I kicked the ball and the way across the street for districts with his wife crazy do little to snap in our lives and got near the fair [noise]\nOh my God it's good ruined the yard\nAnd all of a sudden this kid just came out of nowhere and left the ball down [noise] and he said today\nIn the moment that had happened not one of us even said who is this do is because he looked like us but this particular kid he was with none of us and that's when we first met him\nWe'd all went inside the funeral home and we're sitting on the road like we normally would\nDo and he was sitting with us\nAnd he didn't speak we weren't speaking because we weren't supposed to so he was being on usually quiet was just par for the course but when we got up and we left\nA couple of us were saying how he could play good what's his name oh I think he's who easy\n[noise]\nSo does for star turn up all the time we were playing [noise] none of us to remember him ever view there when we would start a game [noise]\nAnd we were trying to meet to get together it would always be in the heat of the gay [noise] when all of us were thinking about nothing but the game changing the ball throwing the ball chasing each other being on a bike racing\nAround the corner there'd be one more of us he was skinny brown skin I'd say uh\nWhich afro not much fro he wore short sleeved shirts and that button at all nothing underneath the cut off parents [noise] tennis shoes and no ... oh\nHere's speech but I Would say something like or do you want to go up the street or do you want to stay here I Would give him possible options he would not or shoulder shrug or tablet expression on his face\n[noise]\nThe reason why none of us went into great depth about why he didn't speak is because in our community there were several kids and adults who had this kind of disability [noise]\nThis was an era where people with a developmental delays they get treated at all\nI saw lots of kids coming out of the country didn't speak couldn't speak with me a doubt that wasn't so uncommon I probably knew a half a dozen kids like that [noise]\n\nOne day being the kid was hanging out in LA and I was looking at pictures flying around the funeral home [noise]\nI had to ... he was saying I like bitch\nSo I took him to my house to see my pitches\n[noise]\nI got introduced pigeons [noise] raise the surges when I was maybe ten years old [noise]\nPut him on your arm or something and give them a grain of corn and they were cool they relax you could you could rub their back in a squat down raise their feathers up [noise] cool and wings up in the air and spread\n'em and they wouldn't they wouldn't fly off [noise] and it'd be able to walk out into the street with 'em and\nToss 'em up in the air and watch 'em to say a little distance [noise] and it comes back to you [noise] that was that was the magic if you made a bird comeback team [noise]\nAnd so I was raising a pigeons or the makeshift who by bill in the\nBack of our house where I live with my mom and my step back and I'm like most of the kids we didn't have any real\nFormal coup so we make them on a piece of plywood both signs and posters even old television sets\nThere's one type of pitching called rollers the rollers are different in that they have this habit of flipping in there we call it rolling but what they're really doing is flipping\n[noise]\nThe effect of that is the pigment would be flying and it would be like he stopped flying in mid air it starts falling out of the sky\nThat's what it looks like and they flip flip the better ones will do that almost two they hit the around and come back up\nIt's marvelous thing to see and we would jump up and down and scream and holler at clap our hands during courage to\nTo grow and you it'd be a bunch of us stand around flip and scream and holler [noise]\nCome on come on come on slapping a hands together come on come on come on all of us had different calls ... and we would do\nThese pages were off financially out of our means we're all poor kids\nPicturing like that would probably cost six dollars\nIn Nineteen I'm Seventy two Seventy three we're okay we're bird you could get but if you had a roller\nKnow up to that point I hadn't had any rose\n[noise]\nWe're in the back yard he's really excited and he's comfortable\nWith his ... you know he knew how to hold them the right way the way he smiles too with all the way he touched on this fresh air wing for how they were comfortable with him the way he walked around the coup and pool that mom why here\nAnd looked at my nails and he smiled at me and we walked around and he looked to see what I was\nFeeding them and but the one thing I couldn't\nGet from him then was\nWhere you from where you stand man who you know folks who you who you relate to what school you go to who you is you know and he would give me nothing\nWe would hang out more and more we do more walking through the back alleys would spend more\nTime in my backyard and one thing in particular happen [noise]\nWe're walking through the alley [noise] and a lot of allergies were dominated by adults\nSlow street no that would just take over and Alex and this was one of those cases\nAnd we've both just took off [noise]\n\nAnd he ran and ran and I did look back to see what the dog was doing I got about two blocks away and I was out of breath and then we got away we were together we're ... we're friends now they do when I was he even read it hard [noise]\nBut [noise] he wasn't there [noise]\nI didn't see him again to the next day [noise]\n\nFor the first time\nI was starting to feel funny about him and that didn't make sense it was scary it's like you disappeared you weren't there was no place to go [noise]\nI wanted to see him so badly the next day\nI was in the backyard with the pictures and that turned around and daddy was\nAnd we went ... went to the coup like she normally would do\nI had to ask him way\nWe do anything else were we play what what happened to you yesterday where did you go and he gave me nothing\nWhen I mentioned to my mother about this boy do come and go and disappeared and speak [noise]\nMy mother immediately told me stay away from [noise]\nJust said stay away from she was afraid [noise]\nI didn't want to [noise] wasn't like I had a lot of friends [noise] whatever it was it was good to me [noise] he was my friend [noise]\n\nI won't say it was a month later [noise] so we're probably in August and now [noise] and we were taken a usual walk through the ...\nBehind the funeral home and we've been walking for a couple of blocks but we've started going to he was leading me in a direction that we never went before\n[noise]\nWay I always start with amount I get a good hard look at the animal I kind of wait for them to\nSpeak to me and lack of a better\nFor it and see what is unique about them [noise] it was\nGorgeous as far as roadkill goes it didn't have any broken bones it didn't have a lot it didn't have [noise]\nLeaves and maggots [noise]\nWhy have an aunt in it [noise] it was really in good shape [noise]\nThat had really nice brown for and\nThe whole thing was kind of golden brown but at the tip of its tail was white\n[noise]\nNormally a specimen this perfect is a home run but there was something about this particular world\nThat looking at it just made my skin crawl and I couldn't exactly explain why I felt uncomfortable\n\nI just it was almost like I had this no no no no [noise] kind of drowning it out it felt more like being screamed that honestly it was frozen\nSolid but it\nAlmost looks like it could hop on and just run\nUp the tree as I was looking at the squirrel I was just rock with these horrible intrusive thoughts [noise]\nYou're just discussing what are you doing what are you thinking about this right now\nSo I had been struggling with these thoughts and I picked up the squirrels and I picked up the exact a knife and\nI always start the incision right between the shoulder blades a you know below at the base of its neck and then you know you do from the shoulder blades down to the tail down\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAs soon as I pressed the tip of the exact fell into the\nSkin I felt that go in a tiny bit [noise]\nTwitch [noise] ah it was just a fraction of a second\nI I definitely saw it that quit some flicks that little shiver and it startled me so I I dropped a squirrel\nAnd the night and they expected it to jump up and run away [noise]\nI'd hoped it and convinced myself that\nIt was a dead squirrel like I mean obviously it was a damn squirrel [noise]\nSo I still myself [noise] picturesque world backup got the exact laid and\nLike ripping off a band aid I just I stuck with a knife in and dragged it down the spine line [noise]\n[noise]\nHi worth my hands and the blade got it to the point where I can get my hands around its stomach in between the skin and the body [noise]\nAnd then I started working its little arms five just popping them backwards through the skin and got it skinned out so it was almost like it was wearing a one Z. of its own skin [noise] and the final\nPart was a cutting them live [noise]\nI suddenly had a really sharp pain [noise] underneath the knuckle um the painting on my right hand [noise]\nI drop this girl I drop the blade\nAnd I look at my hands [noise]\nGlove had actually been torn open [noise]\nAnd underneath that there were four short rats marks on my skin all really close together [noise]\nSo I took off the damage and as I was doing that [noise] I noticed a little tiny bit of movement and ... and so I look back up at the world [noise]\nAnd it was lying on the table [noise]\nAnd I saw the four\nFingers on its huh [noise] slowly curl up into a little fists holes first second and then really slowly relax [noise]\nYeah that's me I [noise] I just I panicked [noise] having these feelings [noise] scenes affirming [noise]\nI can explain that whatever that's just my own brain [noise] being a deck [noise] having a a\nWorld pa wound on my hand was much harder to explain away\nMaybe I put too much pressure on the brain and that sent a signal through the dead muscles to make the paw flick and it caught my glove just write that has to be it because the only other explanation\nIs that I just skin to this world live [noise]\n\nIt did occur to me several times to just stop\nIt felt like I was going to be cursing from that point on to never have\nAnother good experience with taxidermy which would be devastating\nLike what if I'm done what if that's going to be like this with every animal from now on\nI got as far as picking everything up to throw it out\nBut if I had given up it would have been a huge step backwards I popped out a new glove clipped the wrists and the or ankles or off the carcass I buried it in a plastic tub under about ten pounds of salt so that it could\nDehydrate and put her on the shelf underneath my uh underneath my bedroom window and went to bed and [noise]\n\nI could barely sleep that night because the scratch just was dropping and every time it's Rob I thought about the world [noise]\n\nThe next morning I woke up\nAnd all I had to do is change to solve it can't possibly get as weird as it was yesterday\nI took the big bag of salt outside when I open the tub that had the skin inside\nThe skin was sitting\nUp halfway out of the salt as if it did for road up for air like a ... be getting up from its grave [noise]\nIt was just sitting there\nStaring at me with these empty island [noise]\nThe ties kind of sticking up reaching out [noise]\nThere's no way the dead holiday were all pushed its way up to ten pounds so there was also no way that anybody has touched it because\nThey all think it's disgusting [noise]\nI just dumped out the salt buried again put it on the shelf and\nWalked away from it for I expected it to be a very long time\n[noise]\nOne morning while I was finishing my copy I heard a squirrel start barking\n[noise]\nAnd I it's for a second I burrows because I'm thinking oh my God it's back it wants revenge but it was just another squirrel outside\n[laughter]\nI just felt sad thinking that you know well dang this world that I was\nSo afraid of [noise] it also used to nibble and caper\nAnd get her and mark and [noise]\nUm [noise] bearing nuts and it just kinda it just kind of all hit me that this was a living thing and it had [noise] I don't know dignity [noise] I went back to the [noise]\nAnd uh you know the\nHealth was actually still in there it hadn't uh trying to escape again but I just opened it up\nI felt like I go to an apology and I started talking to it so I said look I'm Sorry I didn't listen\nBecause I think that you were telling me to stop before I even started\nThe only thing that I Want to do is preserve you and make you last forever\nSo the next morning I woke up\nAnd walked out on the porch and looked up in the big oak tree that's right over the fence I saw um a brown squirrel not medium size\nReally bushy tailed with a white tip\n[noise]", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018",
