or Denis says well Colum wrote to Cynthia specifically is because he read something she wrote for the Washington Post that stuck with him he seems Ernest when he says that he is and reaching out for attention but as one last effort to get his words scene\nBut it was the first time I'm writing because this is my last day on earth that rang to Cynthia had\nAt first I thought well okay I've let me researching [noise] as I realize\nThat it was someone who really was potentially going exist and first of all and was going to do this I actually started to get these are somewhat angry but I thought who does those who does this to a total stranger and it sounds callous in retrospect and I'm not proud that I had that initial reaction\nBut they got\nThat up enough for angry enough that night that I thought there's nothing I can do about this this person is in Japan I don't even know really a substantive way to try and reach this person if I wanted\nTo and I clicked my laptop shot and I put it on the floor next to me and I went to bat\nBut Cynthia didn't really sleep that night and in the morning she felt terrible for her non reaction and she started trying to figure out what\nTo do with all the way in Japan\nAnd as far as she was concerned she was the only one to get the email\nBut about that she was wrong [noise]\nThat morning about a dozen people all across the world's got the exact same ... somewhere in Japan China and various cities across the U.S most of them didn't know each other all they had in common was that they were writers and at some point they wrote something for the Washington Post\nMy name is Daryl horn and I'm a novelist\nWriter Darren Horne was at home trying to get her four kids ready for school when she decided to just take a quick look at our inbox\nWhen I looked at my messages I saw the title of the message was saving all like I say so I have people throwing lego at\nMe and the sort of thing while I'm reading the message and fighting about who's going to get in the car for in this kind of thing and this person is writing to me saying this is my last day on earth\n[laughter]\nWhile they're at debated what to do around the same time and another city entirely a guy named Ron Charles opened his inbox\nOn the book editor of book world at the Washington Post [noise] we get you know you can imagine hundreds of pieces of mail there every day from people desperate to get reviewed or published\n\nEverybody insist that they know that we get a lot of pictures but in this case very book is really special and if we would just read it if we would just open it and read that first chapter you know we would see but you know if you get thirty of these measures as a day for Seventeen years it's easy to get you\nKnow a little skeptical\nHere's Derek and\nIt almost felt like an emotional mugging but it felt a little bit um I don't want to say manipulative because that that implies that kind of malice that I don't think this person had but it felt unfair I feel guilty even thinking of it that way because I Know that's wrong to feel that way\nThere are Cynthia Enron never met each other all they had in common was the Washington Post and now they all had to figure out what to do about this email\nI was just looking for clues in the email is how I could find this person she mentions that he was in Japan or he gives it provides an email address for his ex wife\nSo I wrote a brief no to this woman just said you know do you ever met them you're mentioned at the bottom of the suicide notes\nI forwarded the message I said I received this disturbing message\nI Hope that you may be in a position to help this person\nIf there's anything you can do this isn't anything we can do please let us know you know Ron Charles Washington post and then\nI just moved on with my day\nCynthia the one who ignore the email at first did some extra research to find out who she could contact she poked around on line and ... relative then as his knees on Facebook and message turn\nIn the messages sent to apologize for getting in touch this way and then explain that she thought Dennis ... should know that ... might be in serious danger [noise]\nI remember that was a snow day in Washington and my daughter was off school so I just close my computer and I took her outside and we played in the snow and I remember\nLaying on the ground that we made snow angels and I just thought God I Hope this guy is okay\nCynthia didn't hear back from done is not the next day or the day after that or the day after that\nCynthia didn't stop thinking about him and then one day she heard back from his niece\nAnd she said\nThank you for reaching out to me I Am Dennis Williams nice and he did commit suicide\n\nI was just got to be the best way to describe it felt I felt like someone to punch me in the stomach\nThat feeling lasted for\nDays and weeks and [noise]\nI guess like any grieving process maybe it sounds strange to say the grieving process because I didn't know him I wasn't a family member of his but that lingered for a while that I had this connection now to this person but he had very\nDeliberately reach out to us dabble is the\nConnection and that that it hadn't worked out the way\nI'm Better movie version of it whatever down where I Would have somehow figured out a way to save him\n... [laughter]\n\nCynthia decided to do some research into who Dennis was in the process she found out that she wasn't the only one to get the email so she called some of them up to see how they had reacted too and she was the one that told all of them about Dennis his death like Cynthia there hadn't stopped wondering what happened to Dennis\nAs upsetting as it was when she and I were sort of talking about the timing\nAnd it became clear that in fact when I received this message that morning with my children are running over my house he was already dead\nThis horrible too but it does kind of help to know that nothing I could have done that morning would've made any difference I don't know I've been by who cares whether it makes any difference to me um but it does make me feel a little less wretched about it\nBut you know our our lives are predicated on this kind of a cold but so right\nCynthia I'm like the rest of them may have gotten the email when Dennis was still alive but what is truly impossible to know is even if she had emailed him right when she got it that night when she was checking your email in the middle of the night\nWould it have made any difference [noise] when Cynthia talk\nTo his ex wife cake oh she found out that Dennis ... always plan on doing this he always said what he had said in the email that when his work was done so does he have a strange none of this was at\nAll surprised the cake out\nHe had emailed her to right before he killed himself he asked her not to be sad\nI'm happy he said when he went up to the roof of his hotel\n\nWhen I've talked to people about this in the past months and months since it's happened\nThere's some folks who say well you know could you have done more and where are you being cold about it but he didn't ask for help in fact he said he was resigned to doing this that he had decided I'm not asking of any anything heavier he specifically says that in part of the ladder\nUm he just wanted as ideas to survive [noise]\nHe left very few people behind among them a daughter who he didn't raise and who he was a strange from\nHe popped into the lives of strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether\nBut not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook and blog up just in case someone got curious\nAbout his work that was the part that upset me\nThe idea that he felt\nThat this was what was important and his life\nAnd nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill himself because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I I've been very fortunate to have had a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to\nSee this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but\nIt would never occur to me that my writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another Alan ... a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet I shouldn't have her literature and I'll say that when\nYou study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Austin", "day": "07"}
