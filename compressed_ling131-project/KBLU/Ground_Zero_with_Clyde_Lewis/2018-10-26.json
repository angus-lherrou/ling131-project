I really don't feel like you know I've done anything wrong or I Would be judged you know ... it really you know I don't think that you're asking her that\nWell it's not a time and they've never felt that way I live with that\nI said it's not a movie so of course that's really not going to happen in the ways that you might imagine but\nYeah the vampires of the movies and on the same as the vampires when in reality you should do the gym\nI Know that I just yeah I don't know that that\nObject I've got about religion will Jim thank you so much for calling and sharing with us and uh [noise]\nAnd everybody says directly or vampires are not real correct and you have to be shown to be a believer so how do I\nBelieve if you find if you ... they believe are just like yeah they got it a lot about believe okay we thought about believe I think it's kind of becoming cleared is not about to believe it's about so you like the taste of your own blood\nYou read this is not a religious following this is not something that it's a religious or act it's something that you know within you if you're a vampire or not so if you like the taste of your own blood\nAnd you want to explore further into what can be done to become a vampire leads to\nHave is insatiable ah you know there's for blood in four or whatever else energy use or whatever else you want to seek out right\nThere in a life you know they truly are what they are and how how that'd be proven how can I Know that for myself\nWell you know a um go ahead can I can I say something I'm at ... so so from the beginning of the call it it sounds like\nYou're looking for something that I was looking for at one point which is to see the fireworks of something to know that something is true now I I've done that before and\nI've been in in haunted places I've always looked for proof but the truth of the matter is there's [noise]\nThere's rarely fireworks so if any rarely earning ...\n... am I going to turn into a vampire between by blood that's why I Want to know\nNow there are all that no matter what you would turn into as a donor you become a donor I yes\nI got that yeah I Know what that is right but I Am a stern for myself I just have\nTo be together but what I get a turtle life like you or be ... be be destined for another state and after death or you understand\n[noise] yes I Do understand and and they answer than I\nUnless you're like me now\nYou have to find your own path you have to find your own way you know everybody does yeah that's what I hear from people people who uh other being part of the smoke and do so you're going to find your own way and it's only you discovered self discovery in a weakening I heard the term weakening and ... sometimes sound and\nYou know and if and if that did happen to you and it wasn't for you if it wasn't already in you you wouldn't be happy anyway\nYeah true we'd be happy if you were doing some you don't like it's going to join Missouri Hi Joe you're on ground zero\nThat guy that was good\nYeah I just wanted to tell about her drinking the blood and how does this ceremonial setting or is it casual how do we go about drinking the blood\nFairly casual um although I guess there's some ... to it\nFor the hotter it how do you get your blood though I mean I I mean do people who you were talking about donors there'd be willingly donate to\nAbsolutely yeah and and and you know done is to do it for their own reasons I've had done was doing it because they say it gives them an experience that they need [noise] which I I've always wondered what that meant but I'll never know because I'm not them\nIs there a blood letting into a into a cop or do you drink and drive right from the body\nI drink it from the flow of blood\nPutting it into a ... it's a fast way to get blood jello in which you know interestingly enough you mean or the girls that they're going to retire to\nKill their classmates right and the blood in the glass he would have ended up with a big glass cello that's gross [noise] Joe how are you saying I'm Sorry you were talking over here if you're\nGoing out I was asking if this was just to satisfy her own body weight training or is there more sinister darker a reason for the drinking of the [noise]\nWell initially there's a definitely a physical need and the blood cells some sort of role in Moscow geology and that keeps me healthy\nAnd it keeps me a disease free [noise] and uh as far as darker purposes\nNot intentionally but I'll tell you a there is definitely something to talk to me are just there is and I and I'm not it's not my aim but there's definitely something dark about drinking another human blood\n[laughter] obviously now it's like a weekly daily or and you're only thing we got to do\nWell in a couple of times a month and a good couple of times a month so I'm\nYou know check your delivery and the milkman and we'd rings twice so Joe thank you for your call that's that's pretty scary actually hurting Kansas Iran where there are going to be go ahead\nYeah good evening clotting good evening to your guest I'm I'm I'm sort of they tell the story and so to speak and I have seen many many\nI'm a characterizations of sweaty and Taylor um of trans ... otherwise known as Dracula and I'm very intrigued by that bridge and um it seems to have a little bit of a um erotic sense of of reasons\nI heard you talking about religion and I am a ... that it gets ten um it's just that has not anything to do with them and just with stress\nAnd I am a ... that it gets ten um it's\nJust that has anything to do with them and just with strong drinking at me and it says do not drink ...\nDrinks how does the guy and I just I'm just curious as to your guest is to some of the the um ... at the characterizations of different people who played\nThe character Dracula so\nTo speak um uh you know Tom Cruise or so ago see I'm I Am myself at Eastern European descent\nAnd as you know of that part of a of Europe they are into I'm using the entire animal which includes the flood a instead think\nAlthough what are you asking you ask her what her favorite fictional vampire is or what are you what's your question\nWell my question is um um what are what is your opinion of some of the movies are that are that are out there now you know in the past and now that deal with anti racism with\nDrinking blood or you know with not necessary needle aiding disc\nRight so that's an interesting question because as you know what does the vampire thing of empire in films and and what are the ones that lean closer to the true to you or or experience or you know that's that's a great question is a good option yeah thank you yeah brushing but\nGo ahead ... go ahead I have I have a a I have a massive\nAmounts of digital library of films and\nThere are are there are a great number of them that are really really close to reality if not spot on 'em they don't tend to be the bigger films are there is a good number of them from a northern Europe that so that really get most things right\nAbove a hunger someone told me that was the show one of the favorites of most I guess I'm being players
