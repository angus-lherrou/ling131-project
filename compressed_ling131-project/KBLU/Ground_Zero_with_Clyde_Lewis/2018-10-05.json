Nineteen forty eight or ...\nOkay does anybody know like the advent of the can appear like well ear that was no okay I just wonder if that coincided anyway\nIt was a it was Nineteen forty eight so then I Do for you know May of Nineteen forty eight where they became indoor Israel because of the nation in yeah mean Nineteen forty eight\nNow okay again or just everything that's going on and Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nAnd those are the things the easing looking at ... I mean you're a Christian or right and many of us are like I say you know Christians\nAre right now looking their politics and they're looking at their belief systems\nAnd while they're not diametrically opposed they certainly are throwing wedges into everything we think and everything we do and what a what bigger wedge is there\nThen the debate about sexual promiscuity rape and the death of children and these are the main things that are focused with the horn got a bill and this is the main thing is being focused in this hearing and if the main thing that is going to be ruled upon by the FBI\nAnd by the Senate so if this is not a coincidence a very very deep and meaningful coincidence I don't know what it is\nYeah you're spot on with everything you're saying I appreciate you bring an outlet to like keep that in the spotlight um 'cause the mainstream media share is not going to do it\nI think he thought I appreciate the call and I think can't Snyder\nLet's go to Felix in Pennsylvania Hi Felix from ground zero\n[noise] hey\nHow ya doing doing good man\nHey you know it isn't stressed up okay it's very interesting that ah you know on the topic of bell number here though the internal growth right that wishes and Clinton and I believe for Rocco bottom all hang out there together\nWell yeah a lot of ah a lot of famous uh you know dignitaries leaders me Henry Kissinger Ronald Reagan Nixon and\nGo down the list of all leaders I mean in fact the the plan to drop the bomb on Hiroshima was made the bohemian drove under the hour so I mean a lot of light up yeah yeah the Manhattan Project\nIt was all just it was all talked about and playing down to the bohemian growth that's where it all came down and came down or after revelation for me out and of course you know that when Oppenheimer build the bomb he built it on on ah some old a historic\nUh things he discovered from a debate is the end you punish odds and it was all ancient ah ancient destructive history\nThat are they being revealed to anybody and when asked well how does it feel to set up the world's first atomic bomb he goes no it was the first atomic bomb to go off in modern times meaning that they got the information from the old techs and the writings of uh of some of the older civilizations that have that power way back when\nYou know and I think that you and I have a very similar religious background OK and ... and and uh and thinking is because I was raised of course by very devout Christian parents okay go ahead everything pounded and to me like you say\nGet out of town and into the room and the this whole thing you know about the end of the world you know the second coming in and uh\nYou know it\nI I've I of course have become a bit of an agnostic\nBecause a lot of it doesn't really make sense to me you know like when you go back to the beginning of the Bible you know where you know they say God is perfect God Knows everything and got a table and then the new the new world is going to be you know no more evil evil ...\nRight okay but if God originally created the world is Scott has um that you know knows everything and there's all powerful and hates evil\nIs not the ones who created the devil\nHe created the hell but the ... but the devils are I guess you could say destiny\nWas to be an opposition of God and that is that was the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpside down in birds that so they head is in the ground and the body you split up word same with the upside down ... it was the same principle but you wouldn't hurt the head and the arms and it perverts it provides the meaning of what the symbol is\nSo if you do anything of symbolic gee you know that this arch is very symbolic of something that is being talked about right there in Washington D.
