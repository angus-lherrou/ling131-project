[noise] a leaf third improperly recent the letter to his work as well and he never set up for the first time the court [noise]\nAnd um now you have an extension and he's trying to keep the judgment\nWell ... all you have to show up again it's not a question of vacating the judgment all you do is peel it and you get some and he gets an appeal if he asked for it it's called the trial to know so it's not a despite vacating the judgment\nIt's as if it never happened at this point once he follows the appeal David there is no judgment to vacate it's a brand new trial as if the first one didn't happen but here's the problem you're going to have and that is a he stole my wife's\nJewelry box what what how much is that worth David how much uh what what was the value of those jewels inside\nOf the ... the five thousand dollar yeah how do you prove that\nWe have to see the also have an awful pictures of her grand jury Ross\nOkay All right and you have and you have receipts for all the jewelry and you can actually points to every piece of jewelry that she's wearing that ah that is that's gone\nOr if you don't have receipts we do have a picture like actual cash value of a similar product\nOkay honey okay I'm just I'm I'm I'm just trying to nail down so far you're doing great David\nUh how your side of the support so in\nThe piece all important means nothing police report and he's nothing 'cause that's what you said a however uh let's say she's wearing a piece of jewelry and you don't have a receipt how do you establish what's that piece of jewelry is obviously you uh you can establish that she owned the jewelry\nShe's a um it's not like a sort of puts the Amazon where she can go back to her a lot of history\nYeah but but here's the problem is if you're talking about or is it real gold is a gold plated is said to me there's really no way to tell I mean that's that's the problem is always a question of proof\nOr because the uh the court isn't going to say well here's a piece of jewelry and for example here's a ring a and it's a and a jury storage or a thousand bucks while I can get one that looks just like that on Amazon for four dollars and fifty cents so\nHaving a picture for a very interesting and then we go back to her picture on Amazon her she purchased it and productively said\nOh yeah then you got it then and then if you have a picture and you have the Amazon recede then you've got it so now I it's an issue of um you hold the walk Smith liable I Would I'd go for any action\nStrictly led to the fact and he cannot have proper identification\nOnly way to take up but what good if he didn't have proper identification see that's the problem how does the\nWho owns the property does he asked for I'd I'd I'd eat for example there's been a lot of code or whatever like I don't I don't I don't know because for example if you go to my house\nAnd I keep my deed or in a safe deposit box and I asked a locksmith you know what I Need new keys well no I Need the dean of the house to help prove that and you have to call in I'm Sorry who does he call if\nYou if he was taking the taking of done\nNo I get to vote who do who does he call David\nCalling like a telephone but refusing to the third call\nYeah oh I don't understand he was called to show up at a place and why should he who is he supposed to call not show up\nNot call it even the telephone he's serious refused taking the service call\nWhy in the last with code and\nWhy do I don't know of a locksmith code don't want to look at what age what do you expect him to do he if someone calls he had not unless you're not show up\nWhen you show up check identification\n... what is the I ended up David what is the ID do\nI Need to show that we live within\nLike money or something it has to be it has to be that address got it so it's a showing ID to show the live there and he didn't have any idea\nAll right All right All right and that's the only concern is no I didn't know I I didn't know I think\nYou have enough there certainly to ah to take the Watchmen and your friend to court ...\nRuling the detective due to a court thing my ex boyfriend criminally with a look at the court simply\nA yes and the walks and the detectives are going after him criminally Oh yes\nOh then you know what you do it at that point once you have a ... ... here's what's going to happen once he is a job I was dismissed the claim okay at this point I Would dismiss it with or without prejudice\nSo you can sue again because I'll tell you why if it turns out that he pleads or a couple of things can happen restitution is going to be ordered ... uh and that is far stronger than any judgment\nYou could get David on judgment for people like this I mean nothing you have to go collected\nAnd these cock roaches what do you think or let's say you get five thousand dollars okay you have a judgment against them where's he going to cost about five thousand dollars David\nFrom ... from what luck Nick junior [noise]\nOh I'm Sorry I was thinking about your friend a friend or another and then\nWe're wasting police so the police are going out to walk Smith right\nWe're going to have to look at the police are going after my buddy wait so they're not going after the locksmith I don't know I don't I don't think so\nNo I they wouldn't All right so what you have is okay you suit a locksmith\nFor a civil eating put all that Kay yeah all that makes sense All right I think uh I think you have enough there are certainly go to small claims court beautiful yeah I I Would I certainly I certainly would take out okay take care of their own alright so either ah he didn't do a great job of explaining all of that\nOr I'm an idiot and actually I'm leaning towards I'm an idiot on that call\nHuh\nYeah 'cause if I had called and asked the question that question and I got the answer that I got I Would definitely call me in a recall whoever called by the name of bill and idiot even that makes no sense to me I think we're going to take another call what do you think\n[noise] hey James uh yeah yeah\nI got a ... or ... ... it's been nine years now\nAnd I wanted the statue of the shows that I have to pay all that long\nWhen you say nine years you haven't made a payment nine years\nYeah Atlanta payment or not\nYou have not made a payment for nine years yeah OK how much is how much was the original loan\nTwenty eight thousand twenty eight thousand nine years ago yeah now thirty eight thousand\nOh I'm Sorry I thought it would have been one point eight million are only thirty eight thousand well this one I still think you owe it but how are they contacting you\nOh I think it's like they keep selling it for a third\nParty ... well some points James are going to get sued oh\nYeah and yes you will have to pay it and the statute I don't know how long the statute is somehow it seems ten years in my mind\nA bite you get to look it up and you may go past the statute and if it's a federally insured student loan I think they have extra time the feds but James ... always here's my philosophy in life which obviously you are following always borrow money and screw the person that you're borrowing the money from because that\nHow to get along in life\nMany phone calls the white yet\nI Want to screw this person I don't want to pay my bill [noise]\nWe return okay this
