how're you\nDoing well let me share with you a a tweet put out by Sarah Sanders about five or six hours ago press secretary she said the following\nIs there any tragedy the Washington Post it won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because he's such a on a public defender unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nThere was a headline yesterday in the Washington Post that said bomb suspect found inspiration in Trump and the most of today the media is trying to tie Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even know his grad Trump's grandchildren or Jewish\nOr his daughter of vodka became an observant Jew\nA course a Jared Kushner is an Orthodox Jew and so Trump attends many Jewish religious functions and this afternoon I watch CNN try to pay\nThe Israeli ambassador to America by asking you about whether or not the president is somehow responsible for the climate that caused\nThe horrible mass murderer yesterday morning\nSaturday morning I'm Sorry Saturday morning and the Israeli ambassador said no way he said this president is Israel's best friend and that and that it was it's wonderful to have them in the in the oval office if you notice the attempts the last two days to try to president not just to Pittsburgh but also to say is our ...\n[noise] yeah it's ... you know it's absolutely disgusting but it shouldn't surprise us fill the the media and of course the Democrats are so invested in in the Republicans losing the house he been proceeding starting against as president\nInvestigation after investigation that will make cabin out confirmation hearing looked like a dress for her so that the fact that we had momentum and I say we as Republicans we as the ... of members of the party of Donald Trump the Republican Party we have\nHad momentum heading into these lakes final week and they just want to use of events like this to do anything they can for that last build ten percent eighty five percent of the electric who's going to make their minds up in the final days but I don't think it's going to work\nOf course so if you listen to build a Robert Mueller he'll tell you do rock Obama's posted Donald Trump deserve\nTo be in the oval but just that idea they're hearing that flat out evidence to show you that they had been out again and they want to take out Donald Trump the fact that Iraq Obama is out there\nAnd once again it goes to are we going to let this great American experiment um continue with by setting a citizen\nTo office the first one in modern day history are we going to let the Democrats take over and really hang out at the same time in twenty ninth team you know it's not that far on the corner by around march or April you're going to start the Democrats the dates for twenty twenty\nOh God can you imagine it'll be like a bar scene from Star Wars when the Democrats started announcing in February and march and April of next year getting ready in the media then we'll stop complete coverage of all the positive things Trump has done foreign affairs and for the military even sixty minutes or tonight\nAnd I did a story about ISIS being killed that ISIS doesn't exist in the last remnants of ISIS will be taken away\nThe media doesn't report on out do they Sam Nunberg dinner report on ISIS they don't report in the American economy they don't report on the unemployment rate they don't report on public affairs Foreign Relations that are going so well they keep looking for the call Joe the club and they keep looking for the brass knuckles to go after Trump\nThey find something every week or two a brand new thing or rises to destroy him according to a media\nResearch Center Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative and it goes on and on and on and how they can twist the Pittsburgh massacre and doing the anti Trump diatribe ... is a is journalist the gymnastics that would make Mary Lou Retton jealous it's unbelievable\nHow they could did how they could say that the only president in American history loved by the Israelis they're naming boulevards after Trump the only president in American history with Jewish grandchildren that the only president in American history and move the embassy\nTo Jerusalem is somehow anti Semitic when the murderer himself posted quite a few things that he was against Trump anyway but then that never stop the Washington Post ... and ... time Trump to the Pittsburgh massacre\nAnd essays are ... and others that somehow he was involved in part of the ... it's unbelievable the gymnastics that go on\nAnd if they can be successful and try and time Trump to Pittsburgh then all hell is going to break loose imagine how they're going to cover him imagine what happens on a week from Wednesday if we wake up in the morning I get up about six thirty seven AM\nAnd the Republicans have controlled the house in the Senate again imagine what the media would do then Sam Nunberg it's going to look like election night with George Stephanopoulos\nHaving projectile vomiting and explosive diarrhea\nMedia would do then Sam Nunberg it's going to look like election night with George Stephanopoulos having project vomiting an explosive diarrhea and it's going to be the same stuff and I'm going to love and I think it might happen\nI think right now either formula um the Democrats the Democrats you know a an around June are so they they thought they had an easy thirty five feet\nOf it they were going to win they thought they were coming out of California they thought they were coming out of Virginia are coming out of New Jersey they thought they were coming out of Pennsylvania that they were coming out of New York simple is if

plus one or two congressional seats which will be a great thing for those and many of the important states like Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn or Florida with Governor Scott\nOr a course Nevada and uh I think North Korea North Dakota is gone to the Republican thank God high camp is gone ... even at West Virginia how do you vote for Joe mansion when he votes for someone like Senator Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader how do you do that so uh\nWhat's your take on I wished and Nunberg well on Monday or Tuesday coming up next to David re there's been a lot of reporting and now CNN stop reporting it because it's good for Trump about tens of thousands coming here from uh El Salvador\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo a Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impossible for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand in desert that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million\nYou know there are forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted\nOf and no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I Want is a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum and they are in like Flynn\nThey are here they are going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploit the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states\nThis is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo ah to do so and you ask ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for mass illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them ended up registering his Democratic\nTotal is I forgot to government assistance but they all yeah I mean you're\nBarely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies\nAnd uh you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and every one for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read in democratic literature\nIs that if and when Texas flipped to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state the way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years\nThere'll be no chance for Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red thing Ronald Reagan heritage easily Nixon carried raised only California flip it goes up a legal migration\nWho's in the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question\nTrump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects mid western values conservative values he's saying the army or the national guard will not let them cross the New America\nHow do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one whole into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them there's well fed so how do you actually stop 'em\nThe million dollar question without going into Mexico because ... ... that that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you\nHow you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over that's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states and we're done and you and you're done and and and the long list vote\nYeah and all we need to do is and so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nSet ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have in the end of this nonsense\nWe can't get those loopholes closed up\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that and and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in the United\nThe ears are probably very for takes ten Democrats the United States Senate to move legislation right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election\nWhatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot and the taxes they're thrown back immediately in Mexico and you're done\nWe ever a loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa and you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes but then you begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years so unless the Democrats agree to do this\nNo changing the law will happen\nI mean Trump God Bless him I Love him or he can tough tough all he wants\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America\nClaiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support they have no work shows that we need most interested in third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest about their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen now that's how I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do and his best bet is to try to get the Mexicans to stop them in Mexico because once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk\nYou know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol don't run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border of what these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this a stick with us till we get that back\nIn turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mess\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah unless\nMexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and the things is not going to happen is the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan\nAt the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this\nAnd so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and the Democrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats the United states senators to give the same treatment as Central American that we get the Mexicans\n... which means they're here illegally immediately or send back don't have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there\nAre the news media is their Kamala Harris and all the rest are just loving this and the goal David raid there thinking strategically is make Texas a deep blue state and if that happens the Republicans are D. U. N. and done\nWell you know it's a great political strategy\nThe American way left and right so you're only option left as to import future citizens and they're going to do that from central in Latin America\nYou know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans ... of a tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this ... of actually be stopped by Congress until then Trump can build his wall\nHe can uh put up are the types of deterrence that we have on the border to house families together get their asylum cases turned around quickly and then start working on the seven hundred thousand case backlog of a ... who are currently in the U.S\nYou know huge problem now that you have to have the political will to do it you have to have the infrastructure to do it in the United states has to be serious about a closing these asylum loopholes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29"}
