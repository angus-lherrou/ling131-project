I'm not gonna let Republicans do that and not all that are not going to let them turn out to project is I'm going to be more for you\nAnd making that kind of promising to black voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar homes suburbs she doesn't have to be concerned about the climate of violence that's happening in those areas\nHow is it possible that the worst place for an African American to live in America\nIsn't a black congressional district no matter where it is you take this twenty five or thirty black rational districts and it's the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country but they're so good at avoiding responsibility\nFor the implementation and the results of their policies are so good at blaming everyone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status\nOr do you have to lose would ever look at themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we're lousy education systems we have no job creation we're rampant crime ramping abortion Redmond welfare and the Democratic party's been here for fifty or sixty years\nAnd it's amazing to me you're going to have this little result\nBlaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd I can promise you that the U.S and not going to get better for them and they do take a look at themselves and they have responsibility for their own lives and until they realize that the Democrats have been lying to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and they never were

to the mall I have yet to keep them angry and whatever that Democrats want more power whenever they want to get in\nA a vote they cry racism because they know they could crowd is phony ideal racism that most of us will go into a hypnotic traps\nAnd walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that\nAnd it's not going to change it till the glass take responsibility and until white people stop being afraid of that phony words blacks are suffering not because those a lot of racism but due to the lack of moral character the destruction of the family and living on a supporter of the Democratic plantation bill\nWell you know in Chicago look corn McDonald's was a young man who was threatening large numbers of people with a knife they didn't know at

like one life in Chicago can be misused\nTo advance their political agenda which is hey tops\nAt the same time seven hundred\nAmericans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot\nAnd including out boy putting the barrel and put on fire there is no marches no protests milk can scream and holler none about a little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang ... that's like moves on but if you can find years ago is she going company may made a mistake that becomes a fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when there's a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate\nBecause it opens up as you just said is open up opportunities for fundraising\nAnd they can accuse white people making a lot and just see the black and white people and it's all for the purpose of more power and wealth for themselves\nThey don't care about black people they don't care about white people they don't care about the illegal aliens they don't care about their children they care about gaining power and wealth\nAnd so that's why they jump on those type of situation and pushed it alive that the cops are called ... the police brutality\nAnd they support a a like cabin or a cat for Nick they can put the towers were kneeling and turning their backs on the fly around the country\nAre at the football games because they want the far right there that is why Republicans but it's about power and wealth for the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse you and I have a lot more yesterdays tomorrow yes and\nUh I like to think each of us from Cincinnati in from Los Angeles has the minimal impact\nIn the lives of those you might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico it's\nDevastating\nThe world really knew how destructive it is over there are in South central LA east LA cops in watts\nThere there'll be ... years ago they would demand that the the the police officers the government do something illegal alien game members have come in handy I'll come in for number one they're taking away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of a job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there do or\nThe violence and drugs and the crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond a words is devastate a lot of blacks and leave a sausage or LA or moving back to the south\nThey move into a Oregon and Arizona and places like that they're looking for a safe haven because Maxine Waters in the black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nAnd the media and others are given a farce impression\nThat blacks or Hispanics are getting all alone they are not they hate one another they hate the fact that these people coming in and taken over the schools are neighborhoods and jobs if it's so bad that at one point but the trip to the blood has joined forces to fight against illegal gay members\nBecause they they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing in Los Angeles school system is a hundred a Nineteen different languages and dial yes\nOne cannot function in an environment where every student who is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law that a person that they're said to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos\nWhen you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students speaking maybe twenty or thirty different languages it was no one is understood in behavior in norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist at the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I you know I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that the teachers are put into focus on the one that cast the events\nThey put it in a focus more focus on illegal aliens than they are the citizens and so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids are coming from single pair hold ... black women who were born in America those\nThe seven percent of their children are born out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and the kids are feeling I Lived in ... at home and ask who they're just dropping out and hardly a day goes by where there's not a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to because I Can't find or just when\nYou're an educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I cannot imagine being a black kid in Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or do learn a damn thing nothing's being taught\nYou have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property that as devastating and that is the light and that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions\nOf black and Brown in poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't see it\nYou know a nonprofit organization bond the Brotherhood organization over new destiny for the last twenty eight years now we have been rebuilding their family by rebuilding their man so we've been able to help some of those boys from those areas but it's overwhelming at this point and especially since the government the ACLU and\nThe N. A. C. P. and others are covered it up because the ages of power well it just seemed like a hopeless situation right now\nAnd in fact in most almost all the urban areas in this country Donald Trump Republican Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell got nothing to do with running the large cities in this country they're all Democrats so if something's wrong educationally crime wise nothing wrong with the welfare state something wrong with like a job creation\nOh what is in the media and lay down at the doorstep of the Democratic party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Yuma", "day": "08"}
