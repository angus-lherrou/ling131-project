cocoa and sugar\nJay thinking about that permit for decades\nPeople agriculture education by bright been many Americans are basically agriculture ... and so we don't know where the ... we don't know how to get to the store they don't even know the chocolate milk comes from cows and they add Coco to it\n\nAnd that's that's part of programming is right back is right up there with a flat earth right up there with you know the paradigm basically breaking down Christian with us on grounds are I mean how do we escape the programming I mean obviously some would have gotten the controls of the computer gotten control the matrix and they're able to push\nBut what if the population of the size of Pennsylvania believe it or you know chocolate milk comes round couch I mean it's like to have you been issued it is it there's a matrix there's got to be\nWe're getting to the meat and potatoes have everything right now because um it's very easy to break the programming and it's only a matter of recognizing it\nIt's a matter of recognizing how consciousness works in in of itself so as we said there's two types of consciousness on the board you have are Ghana consciousness which are are can be like into a world of Warcraft game with a player actually sitting there a computer and you have the non player character consciousness that are part of the game they were created within the game they were created within the matrix\nNow the organic consciousness can be overlaid with all these different programs um through ... through a programming through the television this and that\nBut when you start to deconstruct all those layers and you start to ask yourself who am I before I came into this matrix I we're all in ... I think that that that's what organic consciousness off feels on one level or another\nWho were we before we we came into the matrix when we can reach down into that level and I call it the rock consciousness that's where the notes just comes out that's where the understanding comes out that's where the ability to be able to look at these programs and feed them for what they are um actually starts to start\nAnd the black magicians will call upon them so on and so forth but there are centrally just programs\nThat are working in the background these are ... what they do is they whisper all of these negative thoughts into your mind and they they have a direct link into the mind and the more that they're whispering into these ... into your mind then they start to be able to affect physical reality because now you're getting all of these stock program start loops\nUm and so on and so forth when you're being put into these uh data states when you're sitting there in front of the television and so on and so forth\nSo when you start to get these start loops if you just recognize wait a minute\nThis isn't really coming for me this is coming from some type of programming um that's been injected into my brain let me go deeper than that let me go beyond that what do I see when I take a step outside of the matrix or take a step outside of whatever situation that we're looking at whether it's the political situation of spiritual situation a day to day situation\nHow can I see this from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective once you do that then all of a sudden the programming breaks and when it does then you start to see the world for what it really is and you start seeing elements in the media or in the political atmosphere\nThat are good some elements are bad you don't come from a place of left or right anymore instead you just come from a place of what is right and what is wrong and the way that I defined right or wrong it's very simple lightened darkness\nIt's natural law it's it ... or you hurting somebody argue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property um if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there are about to pass\nIs that impeding upon freedom is that impeding upon life liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom then you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is instead of saying well my party says this and so I have to believe this are my party says that um so I have to believe that\nAnd then presumably realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other and yet while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once but really the power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality\nAs I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called\nUm analysis and assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest of reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know and the truth or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but what we can do also is we can pick up a rock and move a single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire amount and starts to change that strong\n[noise]\nMm\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speech and fighters by rising
