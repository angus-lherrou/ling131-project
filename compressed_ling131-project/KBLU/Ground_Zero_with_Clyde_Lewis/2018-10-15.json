doesn't mean that the entire nation cannot be turned into Nazis that's the scary part about killing the ss and I read most of the book over the last couple of nights\nTo get ready for tonight's interview with Bill O'Reilly and what are you just pointed out was this could happen anywhere at any time anybody let's continue with more\nComing up next as my interview with the president of the United states Donald John Trump it might have seen earlier tonight to sixty minutes sixty minutes had him on a but Leslie stall then showing a little or no respect interrupting up so much but nonetheless a on a friday night a couple of nights ago he was in my hometown erupt Cincinnati\nAnd he got a hold of me on a on a four or five days at a dumb ass about what's available to stop it and say hello when he's in town when the president I ask you to do something especially one who is as charismatic as consequential as President Trump forty five actually have no problem doing that some things schedule Friday nights of the ...\nI Want to be with the president and he's a warm carrying engaging person the way the way it works the rope line are\nTime together our discussion ... was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that the interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes and I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man and ...\nOr that the interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find a very good because you're good you're going to go to the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think here tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous luckily stole did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm going to hear that interview or in a few minutes and the president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for what's your most British addict and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my friend\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions that come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even know like that\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain\nAnd so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not only call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to tax you cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the or\nWe'd be able to find a way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we feel Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point our money's gonna come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but I said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make their products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been look China is the biggest several mall by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill now Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable at the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls the way it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the mid term relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it cut your way you have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to get me one present Rasmussen fit and we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it\nBecause when people hang up and they said we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means\nA we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on fifteenth judges however that fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five and it'll be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn the law of unintended consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air you know bill I'm with Kevin ... they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base from otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it\nPublicly but if you send in a in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy it's also a terrific talent\nYou know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know showing it was great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we can pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls if you look three weeks ago and you look now\nIt's like especially with the ... she was ... points down now she has four or five points up\nMarcia from Tennessee that ... ... almost all of them\nNow I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good man I mean I don't know Sherrod\nBrown says socialist but you know he had a lot of Trump voters are voting for sure\nBut it wasn't his he's going around and a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time at six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for example to when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election Mitt terms I think frankly I think people are feeling this is very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people they they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized bringing the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energized\nCc Lebanon they lined up yesterday morning us yeah there's twenty thousand trying to get into two thousand yeah it it's a problem with the size of the right way to see what happens if you're not going to believe the energy\nBut we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand arena it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis law and that might think sixty eight yeah I Know I see All right good old I've got three more weeks they loved three weeks and while I have\nTwenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them\nBut you could only move this big equipment so often right hey and Secret Service and all of that but we're very very busy and we're going to the races that are close we're slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of shops and just when we're doing is TV should win yeah he'll he's really good and he should win but uh\nI Will be very upset if he tested but I think it's going to\nThe president it you're the best you're a great American idol I hear that all the time you but you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see you're going to see a few and have an hour or so but those people you're the hero I was with Reagan an eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was a star\nHe was the Rolling Stones you're the Beatles ... you're on the Ed Sullivan show I'm Serious about this\nWhat I really do appreciate your support such an important voice and you've been with us and uh\nYou know just say hello to all you people you have a lot of 'em here a great America thank you thank you very much for thinking\nLet's continue with more built counting the great American live with you every Sunday night [noise] sixty\nBaby el ...
