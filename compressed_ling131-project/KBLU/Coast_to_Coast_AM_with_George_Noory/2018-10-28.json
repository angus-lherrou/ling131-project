my mind today on whether or not it would be appropriate to not do\nThis show tonight on the book demand from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and not that there's a direct comparison to the shooting\nOr this morning at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh but just rather maybe this is a nice to talk about something else [noise] but then I decided that the book is too good and the story isn't really directly related to that type of shooting that happened today\nUm and I just decided instead to ah to give you a thought that I wanted to pass along with all sincerity I I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nOr whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had their human potential to offer the world\nTaken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing kill the demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise]\nSo even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin to my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to case state\nUnderstand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the new\nOperate on so I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors\nAnd yet\nI wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and I regard\nYou totally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days that aren't always good to go like\nUh the book isn't something that they had to overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax than I Do not want to miss with\nThe true story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter ... daughter my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that so I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out\nAnd they say that well it\nProbably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say um\nYou sort of all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case um is very much to your credit so I I Want to start\nIf I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the bus or the red Sox win tonight and and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep all the way I have to be going bill well over here [noise] ah\n[noise] but you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the box and Straggler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or I Would I did um\nUh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an emphasis in boxing stronger case and published in theory about it which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I ... I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in as well but the man from the train is a story it just it just speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story\nToo old to be told\nA news when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder\nAnd she said absolutely not she said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that it either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also is true for all the time that that will be of somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\n[noise] they're right there there are two while they're there for people who were extra lovely executed for crimes that may have been convicted by the man from the train to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but\nA local person was executed nonetheless the or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob\nWho are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that with him ... although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it sounds\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house I'm ... and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town of was\nHome in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always it was just some risk or who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the church of the men from the train\nThe it it is possible we have we assumed\nThat we did not find every crime that he committed with just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA ... second segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that there's this is him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I I have never heard that story before at all and if you hear my pen scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] I wouldn't have to worry about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I'd done something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly have a Seventy percent bucket of forty percent bucket and a ten percent bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder the tower came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he\nEither did commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders per when she would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around\nNinety like a solid Ninety victims guy who cooks right All right so ... gets through a a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is along this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person but it could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most off on a family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the um [noise]\nBodies are moved their kill with Iraq is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they act as a man than at the end of the crime or handlers\nWashed her finger prime the house is locked up high all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with\nBlack it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nAh the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find they\nAre a huge blood stain in one room and then a bloody trail and the body and another um\nSon devils getting big wins it the kind of fun a show or the we were just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking but I'm In the\nGreater up because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nEvery little bit more of the murder what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something\nLike that they um they ah the crime normally heard on Sunday night so you're the hurt on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was walking or one of the primary understood was logging they um\nWell Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all the clarity of graphic patterns and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland a so that that would be a a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is ... is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nOr and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you had with an axe or you did that a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nPerjuring someone the or the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with weird this murder happened it's not that the tone that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin and it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just run the other side of Chicago so very likely couldn't couldn't follow the poet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in the warm weather\nWith one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether his first crime which was you know just an outburst of anger and not and not a plan but that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murderer in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims right or John Wayne gay see using run away some of the things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we get to what eats\nIn terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to because they don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football games to strengthen the dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody is due to the president does him for us to just assume\nThat there was a national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh immigration of this type have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime below Scott Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er er and\nAnd towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was\nHung on the shoulders of a man Howard little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speech to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the engine seat of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body like the FBI yet so\nThere was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true\nAnd that introduces is also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to\nTo realize how backward\nAnd ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture the or they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nReally to to connect it to him and he knew\nThat if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another piece ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this a little bit in in the uh in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is ... it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI effect with expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like it is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it\nAn FCC member agencies serve all fifty states and Puerto Rico convenient\nHelpful knowledgeable nonprofit financial advocates there for you\nWe put that in any place to\nBe one of five million people to do that by twenty twenty connect with an NFC certified credit councilor your local member agency today for the FCC\nDot org slash stopped at work oh eight seven seven for one zero six three two two\nFrom the water our air conditioning and heating studio this is talk five sixty K B L U Yuma\nPoured deadly Pittsburgh shooting [noise]\nJammed in interceptions Saturday evening for the victims of a shooting at a Pittsburgh earlier in the day the gathering included prayers in thinking and memory and the eleven people kill the\nPresident felt an obligation to carry on with these Saturday schedule speaking to a future farmers of America and make America great again rally\nWe don't want to let people that are evil change our lives\nBefore heading to the rally he pledged to tone down the rhetoric is crowds love with one exception\nAnd I'd have a much different John frankly if the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different don't all the time the president\nPledged to go to Pittsburgh soon Bob cost and Jeannie Washington\nThe suspected shooter Robert Bowers faces twenty nine counts including hate crimes extra officers have been deployed at synagogues and Jewish centers in response to the shooting\nAnd Barbara coup sat\nAtop Defense Department official confirmed there will be cuts to the defense budget\nDeputy defense secretary Patrick Shanahan says the administration has requested a national defense budget of seven hundred billion dollars for fiscal twenty twenty that's down from seven hundred and sixty billion from this fiscal year the cut puts Defense Department officials in a bind since they were already finalizing a budget with the bottom line of seven hundred thirty three billion\nThis budget cuts comes as defense secretary James Mattis has been considering budget growth and three to five percent ...

this house here or there is a dark house or he's holding matches in front of him or with no gun or to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his\nOther himself going from room to room finding bodies their eight dead\nHouse in a small quiet western town the um [noise] uh and all of them hit my head with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl\nThe man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a great uproar is you can imagine what the crime was not solved\nA two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local set of them Frank Jones of finance or the crimes\nThere isn't any chance of the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but\nThis campaign to prosecute Frank Jones divided pulled us or in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a K better badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nIn this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a walk her son was eventual they run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nPersisted in the city I Would I Would say for two extent that they are supposed to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how um crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the the crime steal the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody reading a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody but it wasn't meant to almost literally like ball in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how ... just by keeping my telling a story the beginning middle and end all of these and then it doesn't matter how old the story is is it it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know ... ... a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also teach kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it it that is you know the core of sensationalism but it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened ... had they had they built it you know in\nAnd we had there been any had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town there afterwards\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know that there was that Congress about I don't know that anyone built a memorial to them I I'm for many years the bullets are authorities that I Would say that it's still true today the ... the the\nChamber of commerce tribes types in Politico wish the village was known for something else right right\nThey are ... there there is a house for the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um uh but if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors house has but that but ah where the ... what ... is known for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate\nMemorial right the um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people\nMostly people without a without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... there's an effort to try to just enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of down is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps of trades crimes with the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and then joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many\nPlaces many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally an absolutely forgotten but at some of it's still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview and I really want to get to the part about how you think you live narrowed down this suspect so let's let's go do that [noise] let's go through that process Ninety victims\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so it goes wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the men from the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of entire family and a lot of that is a is a rare that it was then and it is now but uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe is let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually you know narrowed\nDown to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is an including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics\nIn England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to trying to find you know well this sailor when from this poor to that port in each one of these ports there was a murder so it it it just it but if you have to use him to START I mean it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it\nIt's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing research like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries during that period\nYou mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or the or and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those bugs um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly the um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and racial says that she did expect to find them but I didn't the um a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nOr there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's say of Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would that you would a\nSuspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah at least you to read you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally mean yes newly will listen to go through the college students or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes in the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy I mean that crime a month ago down\nSouth Portland the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots France that were central to the trial\nOr again size six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because um the uh\nUh ... uh and and other places when he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nYou know normal sized person of\nA ... a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right handed that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area we had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience blogger\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA pre predestined girl a that was there in the first crime in the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the blunt side of the X. oh you'd never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn this first crime blunt side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him\nSilly you started to look for blind or left handed and filed Nicholas ... I didn't even longer axe murderer [laughter] I'm ... ... well how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who when he first crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing at a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to whom he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so he killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we use ... he wouldn't he was a German immigrant the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe've found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the um are are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know you\nHad entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know it was more like it and then walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they they so if he had been in the German army a German

that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had an ... when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten in Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah this is why I connect to the story I grew up\nIn a small town in the Nineteen fifties fifties Nineteen sixties and we have an accent what bottle outside her house and I I chopped a lot of with with them or to a burning out\nYou know my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood\nAnd and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of woods jumping then for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago and the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest villa feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between holds the vision you wrote about and that says that\nThe murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts and his wife had right that's the way he describes it and and when the calm he is not going to be caught so\nYou know he he had walked the cat up into the wall and the you know he tried to get brought him into the basement and said look how how the law was but he always cutting it given what\nThe uh uh by the way while doing research on the crime book\nI I happen to find a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six a which is apparently the original story from which the cast of ... among the autos is based there are a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThey are anyway the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not\nTo get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to be\nBut that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nA aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out you're basically of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing the crime scene inflating a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that the so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYeah have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restrain right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money the the uh the chosen disciplines I'm now you mentioned those go to Marie who's in Athens, Georgia on Tuesday coast for a Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in\nUm well I was calling because I I was kinda curious the first of all you got out talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were in fact the gay and murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however may that grandfather that was he was killed with an axe\nAnd then they think that his wife and maybe a fan did that but I ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he was right out and I feel I guess they hope that some field workers would be blamed for but anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or Taylor and I got about two years I guess right now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering and you may you mentioned earlier about\nIf a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be [noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but see I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he's saying she may have now like if you're going and\nWhat is it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about the luxury brought me to the uh and uh I Wish there was on the ticket helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the er but I I it's\nNot something you can and what do we could do it Rachel and I were to sit out the salt and other series of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we were doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nYou know I'm again I'm Sorry but the Murray let's go to my uh ... in New York uh for a Bill James on goes to goes day um\nYeah it's got morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see a ... year back in the shadow of what are they likely that Web looking forward to it but I have a two part question with some\nBut then I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the\nInternet the first\nPart is now we have is that she would already faces at at hand\nAh people at the FBI or can sit at profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of might might slashed this guy out\nMuch for that I'm also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in time to somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um\nWound up but not even going to trial but get name Lynch and the last part is a ... you mentioned about the state it up police at this time at the turn at the century [noise] at that sought a I'm\nA ... I recently read a book by you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white it has on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to always looking for a fugitive\nBlack folk but they off this planet then as basically competing gangs are basically street gang with volunteer fire department\nThat had can eating fights and and ... and and I like in common that whether he's familiar with the gang that came up as as that that form then the police and I'll listen over over\nThe Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions yeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse hearings are from New York and pretty civil war because they\nAre I wrote about them in the book popular crime or the war in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York and I want to say can\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts a poll whole fictionalized says the murder Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that\nCrime but it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house of blues assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nDidn't hang on I'm going to put opinion right there because we want to get back to ...\nAnd then the ... just definitely in the book and then the state of the police news or the other questions you have a chance to answer coming in to the dentist and Dave please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\nAll night every night on TALK radio five sixty he beholder you you\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie ... there's a lot of them ... during the day in there and it's kinda cool though she left it because the question about what it Indiana modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI I haven't asked them to do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the up a John Douglass monitored a wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska\nOr one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it off the chart of how organized is is burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organize a the a and and also he he um he said that\nRobert ... Kelly who was accused of murder as it is a really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized but also because he was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something\nThere's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine on on the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know\nThe book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and that's that was accused of the crime ...\nHe was just a a he was a a a mock around me was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years uh before a he became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually worth work trying to free him and did free um the governor of the main event straight\nA grab it grab a full pardon to him on it aren't based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of the stories like\nThat in this in the book it's it's quite I'm it's a terrible side effects of what happened or nothing\nBut New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred\nCrimes occurred in places that didn't have a place to park the or the you know they had like a city Marshall and that was it the er so it's not it's not really that the uh not really that connected to my book [noise]\n[noise] no they're not um but it just isn't illustration it in that movie of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was buying for jobs even if that meant getting into like to keep them um\nAnd and um and by the way I think profiling or would do indoors what\nYou've done I think you'd want to I think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they are I Hope so it's not as good as I\nKnow it really did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but this is the first time caller Jay does in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead and say\nI'm I'm Glad to hear you back on and cause it calls\nThank you miss yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor master for baseball\nSo I've heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know uh I I heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad to seal the to bring it up in in law had him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be ... for that I use out of their visor either just painted visor from Boston Red Sox now but he basically and that's and save all matters so his entire life\nAnd I and what is trying to say about my this book is I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I\nI'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nAnd what's the broader point you think I'm missing\nI think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend\nOkay well it was built by happened if I happen to ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my 'em up on\nThe average age you're saying that that gave it's awfully nice of you the right here for the poor girl but that McCain but uh I my both my career has been working in baseball and

more enjoyable for me throughout my whole life and they have your hamster or you know you know than bill but anyway the the reason I called in Philly thing at a time of year\nYou pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than Boston around you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the border Mars the X. orders and if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is or it could be connected to New Orleans packs murderers and and the answer that one is easy no they're absolutely not connected to the New Orleans ax murder the but the Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murders ... to convey that with a heavy AK ... in the middle of the night Lizzie Borden murdered committed with really a a hand to hatch at hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr I couldn't say that it you know and all connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh uh the board and family\nAre on the night before they were murdered and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nSo that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and uh ... I think that Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and it may be speaks to the idea of going into it it does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near ... no that was that the property that two inside cats\nUm and the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was you know what why would somebody going to the house\nAnd killed were it not for that that was the part of the motive piece was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was and she still do inherent property which makes sense\nBut it did it did give me a moment to where I was thinking about the early to go to a dentist is in New York on coast to coast am for Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\n...\nIt's been a wonderful program it's a ... well thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nGlad to have um\n[noise] and I'm Glad you're back I limit for them to you for years and I I Know your way through to the problems there are a little ...

places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this this is\nThe love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston

crushed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they had recently uncovered but what if they did well then you know they would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all your lungs in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween [noise] um\nMost people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn main\nUh the greatest family ah\nPut the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a hunch that feeling of getting off the NFL life\nAnd you're a crash in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out to bottom line is like state park or which again has and history at the bottom last and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful lake great place to RV camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and ah you know it's just that that the area there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with an especially around\nHalloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip down to the Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the Iraq War on international year from in Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely with check out the library for those who are really the sneakers and do you believe\nA and it isn't it that we have a new effort toward that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over Twenty years and he will take you to the\nA ... of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent\nA house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and\nSo those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence until we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are\nBecause at the sticker and you will come and\nWalk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have few amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] puts on a big fall festival with our police\nOfficers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers them on his name is Bob and ... and uh you know people really come here\nSearching for the truth and we as local\nWe we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversaries of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand\nVisitors that on the UFO museum and Research Center\nHurting goods pretty good and pretty close to what\nThey get in Salem, Massachusetts a into a a bringing our next guest next but thank you want to you know and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance we'll say hello okay\nYes pleased there thank you\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the ... the director of tourism and public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book your sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in American but it has an even more extraordinary pleased in the timeline\nOf American history that I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAll right uh there are about forty thousand usually um they need on Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people a lot of course of the month it's in the quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for that\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drilled down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\n... that there\nAre other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which wasn't the last one that was shot and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt in the honestly it's really a problem today even in and I'm also developed countries are still being being asked you for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way um I like to rub zombie story there\nDental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael methods for health markets for your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\nOf them\nAll night every night on TALK radio five sixty ... you you [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just tend to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but at\nSalem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery of the even the big question or a book and I think it's a combination of probably\nTwo dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as what city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean\nI'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\nRight through it I think to try that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was authentic part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation around filmed actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nToday which city means way more than just the victims but was trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has like a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah I guess this is important in this ... great distinction can't help but feel do it sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing\nWith that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath their floorboards so to speak and part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically so that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first in October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit sound that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to\nGo to bars watch the fireworks all those kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans no Marta girl you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get an Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol is consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts family film right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right blues is a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so that you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean it's a little known for being hunted either Salem witch ... are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters cause of the film which trial then just\nWhich is in the story involves demons and ... and ... and ghost everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours\nThe executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there you go there so oh yeah all the time all their two weekends ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the Bennett asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nLet's so let's the best the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well one of the uh one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston trainer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical events that then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch\nTrials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh of mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing all of a say on busing but they're doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the founders a city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the witches and it would just have this really strange position where they call them some of which is ... and you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of\nOne paycheck but then you can send them to college with Sam I can

so you know start north get their actual aliens walking around rouse well\nThey might be able to blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails if America demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what\nHappen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing again he extended the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but but but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah a ... it ... it would all be over now the boss it'd be going home with a trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider it was really interesting and I kind of a host was afraid that the guest Michael Guillen the science writer former professor at Harvard and the guy who used to be on\nAnyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout [noise] a a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the tone of pot test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nGetting all so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity at people moved to Roswell all the time but this is that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do it if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] armor people go out here\nIf it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special to Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to graves farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about\nSeven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nUh the graves family ah put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they change it every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience aren't you\nKnow that haunted feeling of getting lost in a field like a UFO a crashed in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out to bottomless like state park ah which again has a mystery at the bottom last and and it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I'm I'll be traveling ... moving coming up then in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose will on my way to\nA new position will be teaching you to Kansas State it my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to go get Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to get ... well before we come back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of depression Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year for a museum and Research Center which um\nA great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact locations\nOf the timing\nOf the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still\nKind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed\nIn in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists\nAre because at the sticker and you will come and walk down\nArea that wind which is a great story I bring your ... picture stock in the rock a visitor center we have to a meeting alien decorate a certain time especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community that um these they're about six foot alien or not people ... pictures with and and you'll hear the story of you know are employers ... off and ... and\nAh you know people really come here searching for the truth and revoke or we\nWe don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're account about forty thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for Korean families\nHere a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors ... Research Center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey you know and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance they'll say hello okay\nYes please bear thank you\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this was this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[laughter] yeah All right uh there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people I'm I'm In the course of the month if it's in the quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in shame on the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that said I wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut\nThousands of victims yet\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is that it's it's really a problem today even in in those countries are still we're being asked you for being with you but the strange thing about that to me of course the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I feel\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem in Salem at Halloween\nOn the way um I like to rub zombie story there in the book to\nGeico resents eyewitness interviews with inanimate objects\nDidn't belong to comment on the scene of a recent health storm here to describe the event\nOf a pro I was just hanging on the roof when it's normally storm starts dropping baseball sized shingles got feed off of the broken Savage anything to help\nNobre I was in survival mode your football can help you in a hailstorm but the guy go insurance agency can help you get coverage for personal property damage called guy go to see how affordable homeowner's insurance can be because they all\nNight every night on TALK radio five sixty Katie how you\nYou [noise]\n[noise]\nSo er Jay W locker author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more\nVaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery of the even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented\nMarketing [laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but it was about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was authentic part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations around filmed actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to sound village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city\nMeans way more than just a victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a Herman which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important and I this is great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder that they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for board so to speak but part of it that's less connected to the tragedy\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to many central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first in October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit sound that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all those kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get it Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol is consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts\nA family film right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right boots on the part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so that you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch ... are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters cause of the film which trial\nThen just involved which is in the story involves demons and ... and ... and ghost everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured well you've been there\nAnd one of the Boston trainer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have come it's all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape the jails there\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the with trials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh of mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so that he wasn't down there do in order to say on busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... breeding painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the failure of the city in complete conflict

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nUh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\n[noise] so even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin of my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the\nTwo of them on\nSo I moved to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet\nI wound up in Manhattan I Know very well and I\nGo oh totally cool so that so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go [laughter] like\nUh the book isn't something had to have the overnight me a book and I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax than I Do not want to miss with this\nTrue story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter read don't or my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption\nI'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really say that and I worked out well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case um is very much\nTo your credit so I I Want to start\nIf I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't book for last night huh [laughter]\nYeah I Would add to capitalize\nOn it I Would have been torture to keep them on a we have to be going well over here [noise] ah [noise] but you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the buck Straggler along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or what I did um\n[noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about it which might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the men's on the train is a story it just it just speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once uh and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story\nToo old to be told\nA ... when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said what which best is it's actually\nAuthor can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also is true for all the time that that will be of there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them yet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey're right there there are two while they're there for people who were actually lovely executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man from the train to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train pulled a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people were murdered by a Lynch mob who when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight last year we are pretty sure that was him like Nineteen quell although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it sounds\nSo I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house I'm ... and ... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in when actually one of the first mayors of the town of was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved then they happen to live right by the railroad tracks\nIs that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into this sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise]\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed with just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my pen scratching 'cause I'm writing down\n[laughter] when that guy or a hundred years ago\nTried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth a a a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nUh who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly have a Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and a ten percent bucket right and then wait total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the total we came up with as a hundred and one that actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAnd its murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims is guy who cooks right All right so ... gets through a typical crime\nAs you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nNineteen century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this is this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person but it could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often a family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe the ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they act as a band and at the scene of the crime\nThe handle is washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with\nBlankets so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or something is jammed in the door [noise]\nAh the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nGraduate or up to him because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThem on a tight services like ... like a little bit but yeah there for the murder what that that's just like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they ah the crime you normally heard on Sunday nights they occurred on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen can crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary understood was logging\nThe or doors doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all there are clear idea graphic pattern and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland a so that that would be a link between them\nThe uh uh one thing that is odd is that he would he would\nTake a lap from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the salmon a off the lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lap around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a free in person or a half a second before you had with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and heading heading him as he was\nOrdering someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nOr yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early ... century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin it was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed a poet or another thing I've got\nAnd it was it was in St for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather\nWith one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... whether it's first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not a I'm not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing gun in secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed\nAnd um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled them this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah any fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without ... much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims rights were John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon seriously but then there's a couple of good football game [laughter] I got distracted dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody it it it ... the president is for us to just assume that there was some national awareness\nOf the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks now because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all the and and that this has to do with the organization of the wire\nServices at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh ... of this type have little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were\nWere organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is\nIn this terrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the inefficiency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national an investigative a body of like the FBI yet so\nThere was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm [laughter] I thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward\nAnd ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago it's\nBeyond belief how primitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of these crimes and what demand from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThey ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThere was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if you committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crimes science\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this a little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is who do it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI effect with expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like it is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "28"}
