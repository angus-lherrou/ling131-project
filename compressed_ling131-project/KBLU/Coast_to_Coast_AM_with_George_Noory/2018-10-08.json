then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man a ... had a wife that everybody loved had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog\nI mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some poison was special to you and there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was ... moved to the addict at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up\nBy new new that house was really one new\nThere ever read

welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I spirit who crazy light on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black Baltimore area me and my friends were just hanging out up there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we were watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just said and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right are are like right at us we've got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe've started watching them in like this belief at this point\nThey get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that what's going on out there\nThe wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you but we're not trying but no one to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh\nWell Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another Tar Heel and um you know right on in North Carolina everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous exam\nAnd you've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange\nPhenomenon where you have these balls of life that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and uh you know which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise] if you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more grossly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is might compare it to them origins of energy the flow on a human body these are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and interacts at in certain angles at certain cliffs\nIt can create what similar to to ball lightening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightening or they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua ...

you with us Joshua ... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you in doing\nOddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born\nReally um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while in both both sides of my family they'd been in\nThe mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds a but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a hit\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later\nA claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails and uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch\nAnd they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to clogging called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready\nUm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nJeez I'm David ladies involved in this so\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verify the whole story with\nElderly people and historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created and it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of tried to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nGood for you let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my ... is November ... will go go ahead and I was long it will it will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth my mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and\nMy sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first um\nIn a holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period and say that well this is the evening before the spirits\nOf the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day and the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan believes of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worship trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down\nAnd we punish them we're not going to win any friends\nReaches texting and driving\nRange you know what are you doing rich [noise]\nI was just telling everyone how great you are

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories\nTo the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture\nKill and you know God Knows what else civilians are enslave them scare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did\nInvade the civilians were would run off the cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd they were walking in the field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything and then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described\nAs cries and screams so that was\nPretty moving for me um\nAnother story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and he would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nUh he gets a knock on the door\nAnd he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan so those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume elite\nWhat's interesting too man is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of of the world war two supernatural is that the ghost don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman ship\nYeah absolutely exactly\nPeople see these planes and they're really not there\nYet this is a and and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily did they hear them too\nSome do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom I'm a it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military or\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nOr a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway and they sold this very low flying bomber\nCruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for prop ... engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they don't want they thought you write\nBut to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all there didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two it was a I Believe I'm\nA somewhat a flight mechanic for the for the uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern\nI guess like Hercules aircraft and something like it'd be twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps\nA throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\n... the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was gonna crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war or something right and\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said\nThat as they were a starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy\nA make a sound went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be your\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over a and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handle hundreds and we're going to come back and talk more about

to coast to coast Matthew ... with us his website is linked up at coast to coast them dot com a couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities\nPearl Harbor is it hot it or not\nIt's extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who were interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're torn Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the stories that um\nThat event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that are have been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then ah during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so\nThat goes story has been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me\nThere's also a story of of of all of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it\nThere seemed to be faces in them into the picture\nIs a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that ah the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi hands or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to you died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWell that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA ... architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in\nThe United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents\nThere's and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that are between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why this\nStory that a ... or wouldn't ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never had happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic\nRecord that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and\nAnd people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had to step down to the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War\nTwo and do these continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the the bullet a I Believe has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bowl it ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when you ...\nAnd your ... and decided to take a break left lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIt back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nAnd in community country in the global society but when parents got wind of the principles that fake in mind that children's legions to everyone and then forced to reinstate the traditional pledge\nNow the question which do you think children should ... fairly close to the United states of America or the new world order everyone\nA plan that balancing the budget in ten years you know they can't even pass a budget without argue with each other news talk five sixty Jamil you where you ... comes to talk\nFrom the ... our air conditioning and heating studio this is talk five sixty K B L U Yuma\nFirst week on the job Michael on the way I'm only at Francis wrote Kavanaugh gets down to work this week as the newest justice of the Supreme\nCourt when the Kenyan reports\nLike Kevin ... is now the ninth justice on the current Supreme Court after a wrenching debate over sexual misconduct allegations and questions have judicial temperament and partisanship that captivated the nation now the nation will watch how the court rules with Kevin ... on it on some of the latest biggest cases of our time\nJust this week alone the court will hear cases on immigration minimum sentences for crimes involving firearms and ...\nWho was sworn in Saturday after a brutal confirmation process as promised that he'll keep an open mind in every case\nOf forecasters say tropical storm Michael has built its a speed and gotten a little stronger and is expected to dumped heavy rains over western Cuba in the coming hours\nBefore it makes its way towards the U.S Gulf Coast rational Hurricane Center says Michael is packing Tom sustained winds of sixty miles per hour and it's about a hundred miles east of ...

are very expert paranormal investigator as we talk about several things including the psycho man the him which was popularized by\nOr different Raymond Moody the originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIt's Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing it's like I'm In the mirror I also have an update for you about I'm works in UFOs or later oh we're going to give away some free tickets to my biggest vet in Los Angeles this Saturday yeah there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nAnd the way I'm dumb 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nSay that to me it means something so thank you\nGuys aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the psych them anti um technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon um there are a number of possible explanations\nFor this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel right like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and\nSo it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to describe why by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be\nYou had rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary it's when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble and throwing the thing you know\nYou have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something\nAnd when you go in there with that attitude that's a ... you you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy but you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big near on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and\nBlood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de lap in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on Amtrak\nDramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artist Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\n[noise] you\nWho is a\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition or ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO\nHot spots in the state\nWere incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way with very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina ... group\nOr you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play a an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would\nIn the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in\nOkay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid as all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidences joins\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does the Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for\nEverybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada Senate\nMajority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars in ... [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next theory fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of Nevada\nAnd a good one yes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings he goes on to say\nGiven the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nThe whole ... and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them\nNew so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we moved up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville\nJoined the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with him and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nThat is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing ... there's there's stuff out and it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because they're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulation\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling

let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIf Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to\nDig into this extremely creepy thing if I come at the mirror I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away from free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nOn the way I'm bump 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you [laughter] okay\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nYou got that right or the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western worth\nThis paper and I found again and again when I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel right like it goes on and on and on forever absolutely it's a reflection within a reflection\nWith and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates is some sort of a ...\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to describe why by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water\nOr a bowl of water or a creek highly polished\nStone but there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state then if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but\nTouch and so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively\nGrab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary if when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me I'm troubled are stronger thing yeah you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nUh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror\nOn the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kinda stuff uh yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or a little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with a and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that ah that's a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about 'em or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on ... dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and\nUm I I I sort of gave everybody\nA heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News media in Russia China basically\nI discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nUFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a a a group\nFrom Ashville North Carolina the group or\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play a an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid as all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidence ...\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree\nOr exposed however you want to view it and of course I never believe in coincidence during\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it George new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut there was not there was not no I mean it was broken by the New York\nTimes so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh\nAnd this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic\nNow that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics given that all of these have the ...\nIt's raw pick effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them\nNew so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also wanted to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we moved up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event\nIn Asheville George ...\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ...

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread\nStories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know\nGod Knows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did\nInvade the ah civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd ah they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams\nSo that was\nPretty moving for me um another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and he would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably burritos\nHeartbreaking and he would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nUh he gets a knock on the door\nAnd he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan so those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare ah in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYet this is I'm In\nAnd I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom I'm a it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost playing flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people are claimed to have seen this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they do what they thought\nRight but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all there didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat flight mechanic for the for the uh or a half so definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this\nSay a modern I get from Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they called ghost playing flaps\nA throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war or something right in\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said\nThat as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy\nA ... make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess now would be Yuri\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of it we're going to come back and talk more about haunted World War two next hour you'll shoot your questions and stories\nHundreds of other repairing improvement projects costs in your area I think everybody should I tell everybody is on the

U\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us his website is linked up the coast to coast them dot com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities\nPearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nIt's a extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there ah we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that uh\nHad been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona a just briefly and then a during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so\nThat goes story has been told a quite a bit\nUm [noise] excuse me sure there's also\nA story of a level of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it\nThere seem to be faces in them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted by therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks and ...\nA part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm\nA there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi hands or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along what what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that are between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here are people who believed the story say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would\nBe no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up pawns\nThere's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still hot\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in\nA in a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there\nI found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln and World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill says something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot ... not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting ...\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh\nSome of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two and do these continue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIn back in World War two actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "08"}
