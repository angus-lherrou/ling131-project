P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell why is it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there and the first place\nYou have the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto big travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away\nAll sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly round the sky the fact that they're all off in this one direction and only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that being swept off my whatever the massive will call planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ... Marion and all of that because he does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out\nThe smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger ones and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if you could have gotten a little bit closer\nIt completely ejected from our solar system in which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's\nNo question about it when people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something mass and like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally you'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize\nIf it were really coming it would be so bright that you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the math on our earn where even out how Pluto out in the hybrid down what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of planning nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet is in the solar system and nobody sits around in his worried the Jupiter suddenly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce its existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away and we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty six\nSo January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years so I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have it to Oregon right from the man who discovered this uh in terms of those perturbations\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gathered together out where the guy prevailed and or a or a cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research projects with these scientists is that I had no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat was trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the thought and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on a star because Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity and math uh it it would have impact on every single thing in the solar system\nAbsolutely I would've loved those Zacharias ... been alive to talk with professor I Wonder if he would've been able to convince him about that new ...\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own piece that I\nHad a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do is say that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nHe doesn't agree and some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody knew about this stuff well\nThe idea that there could be a massive plan it but when you read let say about the ...

eight when the world was really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real show dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nBlanket around the earth and at the United nation\nMany countries especially the worry about the island and we see level rise could flood and display\nPopulation they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change often known as the eye can see the and the object gave way to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of the impact on world politics and the economy like twenty\nTo to help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy's\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen I PCC answer is\nThe stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn there will be a catastrophe of mass die offs they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause salmon and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island to coast populations to move\nBut to where the twenty Eighteen I PCC report said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of the day's electricity coal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote\nThis kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago in twenty Fifteen close quote\nHe is professor drew Janelle PHD professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the should be in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries in large part of why we have to report those countries want to the United nations treating best to do lower woman target drinking the\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are the most I leave me\nThe good thinking that two degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the island in the south Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population lives very close to sea level Nigeria has huge population he'd read your street level but you know sodas most of the world I Know in the United states also have an enormous populations of right at the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the ladies can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and moved to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope of this house\nIn West coast and who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere has not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple of decades of at least some places\nThere's an island did not speak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nThat we've seen the water come up through the drains into Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there were very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that motorist can see how deep the flooding is is so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dumped more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from the computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models protect us\nYes the Arctic can't melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already my twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that you likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a worry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized\nOn say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below\nBecause the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the exhilaration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing as more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions and receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nAnd the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd well even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed

have a sense that there's any kind of clothing or garment\nNo I don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is just praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary\nThat is just praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis who's that can be white ... I don't think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the I\nI don't remember the eyes it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't afraid\nIt was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd the the being the praying mantis essence seem to be blowing like a sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was very white you can tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was white it had like ... I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had brought goals are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing every Chilean skin not a praying mantis skin\nWith texture was like that yeah\nBut the form was like a praying mantis into\nThat's how I Would describe it because of the arms they were ... and they were long but you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reached puberty I remember I started having a lot of growing pains\nAt one point I did find a spot on my groin and it was like a puncture area that blistered I just had the ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis what would you speculate could be humming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething is about to happen that's the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late to do anything about our current situation in something is coming to either fix it or maybe help found out that I don't know\nWhat whatever it was you would put it into the category of something positive and protective\nI Do absolutely do I've had many drains over the past few years involving a lot of water mostly how does the water emerge\nI've had many dreams as you know I mean he's from the ocean I wasn't surprised when I saw that film or the Indonesian tsunami that killed so many people\nWatch sets off all of the nominees into money\nI have a feeling something to do with the rotation of the earth\nThat there's going to be like a shift or a jolt kind of like you take a glass of water and you accidentally knock your elbow and the water splashes out right from the remedy go out that's the feeling I get from that I Am just foreboding feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violent and wetter yes\nNow um last night Trump story well it is and things ... ... they started with the issue\nOf uh I was asking people if they had had any kind of childhood out of body in the ages four to six a which is that\nAnd people have been provoked by that that seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white us we'll call it foggy smokers smoky fog that his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a dusty and experience or meditate or had they had any insight about water\nA lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science they said that\nHe had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause soon armies and tremendous amounts of flooding and\nI had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nAbout a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they challenged him call us with conversations with Linda which is coming up later but we've got more when we come back\nTo you\nOn TALK radio watch sixty you\n\nThen

...\nThe ground which I've included in the end of my earth files news report tonight this email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in title closed\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not aligned and it began Hi Linda my name is Tony\nI Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time that the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty ...\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to only\nHear now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town boy what stabbed him as a child and hotter tend to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age I live with my mother and she had a best friend she ... within a two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment\nAnd it's two levels\nYou have to go up the stairs to get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I had trouble going back to sleep and not just they earn it in the dark\nCouldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet but I didn't hear any cars that's how I knew it was very late in life because I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up\nLook up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light up a light light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky\nI notice something was coming down and by the time my notes that he may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert and they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nLook like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it wouldn't be any that were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the saw white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in assault Hawaii began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through with it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seat super long\nAnd what are you seeing what I'm seeing is a person standing inside the soft white part\nLooking up he's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look it at that if a person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this is the\nOnly reason I been climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there you go on a\nBeach [laughter] you know\nWithout a doubt like man I Want to go but I'm going to be you do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand that the key is listen if it gets so this\nOkay so this is very close to you as you are\nLooking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my ... at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this personal looks like God\nThen I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually pills we go out and ride and then I'll go man the issue of looks like the guy who pitcher at church describe everything\nThe gal and he was wearing white when you're looking at this fall why I noticed it was bright or brighter colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and black and white I can clearly see that they're getting our white\n... very bright white he was looking up and he was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair and it came down to I'd say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWas his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say we're straight just like you see when you see these motion pictures are Jesus of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his eyes\nNo I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd ... was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like one ... piece and it went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his speech in this your uncle craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was the end and it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole fear is kind of strange because like it you know made it but I could look in the green part it feels apartment buildings on the other shot\nSince I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window\nYou are able to look through the surface of the white side of this year goal or or craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past\nThe line and the white yes and the fact that he blocked out\nThe apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though it appeared very strange to you that it had to have been solid matter or at least blocking some time to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nYes it is the is floating down is that if you will blow up a blow into food

their eyes for a at least for a while before they apparently go unconscious\nSeeing their body ... I don't know if the word is dissolve a but transform into gold\nSparkly light what you were describing it reminds me and the the people who have had this experience they all say that it is a bit like seeing your skin your body your hand everything turning in to a like very fine gold sparkly dust\nThat is a phenomena that I'm curious about and if anybody listening to Kosovo night knows anything about that specific it's not you're not dying it has a transition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then\nAnd this and that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then\nAfter they have gone a unconscious or whatever the missing time is they are back alive and remembering that memory extremely vividly I find that also a very interesting and wonder George if you ever heard of that\nWell what's what's fascinating to me is when you think about the pictures that we've seen paintings yeah almost all the church and she was for lunch with\nYeah sparkly gold often that's true and what\nIs this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is a physics part of the universe and other dimensions that we have been denied or had never been told or ever educated about it's always been a thrown into the bin of missed solid G or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship between the ... the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be rejected from another dimension\nMore and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle if this so is the important part\nAnd at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimension\nThan recycling back into matter universes has to be a huge and common part of that cycling and we have been left dumb and blind about it\nOur first time caller Steve in Durham I even go into\nA hot Georgia Linda my question is do you think up to Seventy years ... roads well the American people now are really really ready for the truth there will be visiting Iraq because\nIf he's visitors had been abducted people at will er during academy where his shoes to leave it in and was there for us\nAll to be taking people from all parks may be and not returning that the government the food using this national security back to school in ... there were people at risk about safety that we would not it could do go we're okay good\nLawyers and\nYeah I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years uh where I began my first investigation into animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty Eighteen\nStrange was ...\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy uh so I was dealing from a pure as\nFact they journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself with the question of going out into pastures often by myself together to issue in and various things\nAnd my vulnerable and having to decide within myself\nThat I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me a so be it and I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both him is\nAnd I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are now what I'm trying to do is set or a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet is well those animal sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence\nThat is today in the twentieth and twenty first centuries\nAre doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular I think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make it self front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet in the solar system now\nThat doesn't the fed and humans being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human\nCreature that we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is until all of us know all of the truth\nThen animal mutilation and human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand ... be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting\nAnd that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to move the entire planet\nAnd break through like at San Andreas fault that's what it's going to be like and that sort of what you're asking\nThe San Andreas fault has to be the global announcement a consensus of the entire planet\nThat we're not alone in this universe and that the government of this planet have to start opening up what they have in terms of physical craft and beans and knowledge about who is manipulating and why\nIf we have allies we no need to know who our allies are and not be afraid of them if there are hostile as they're described\nBy some people who have worked in the government is on friendly we need to know who they are why they're hostile and that we have allies that are helping us\nAnd deal with that we're gonna come back with more questions would learn the ghost\n\nIt's so important to get a great night's sleep and I can get that with my sleep number bed\nIt really is

year it's just truly appreciated by the coast audience well into my question is about CERN spelled C. E. R. and I can either\nYeah oh yeah exactly the have drawn collider yeah and I'm I'm Wondering if you've spoken to any of your whistle blowers\nGovernmental military scientific who have\nTalked about CERN it appears to be triggering some people say that that's triggering planetary anomalous phenomena through its operation it appears to be the area fifty one of the earth radical quantum physics\nAnd they appear to be doing some great work but they appear to have not just a public persona for perhaps say covert\nYou know side to CERN like area fifty one well\nI have heard these kinds of rumors that on the other hand I've interviewed gosh by now I I at least a dozen\nPeople who have been getting different experiments at different times it's the Large Hadron collider is the way that they refer to it\nAnd I think it started a because I have interviewed one of the physicist who was responsible for a proposal\nIf the if they could generate many black holes like getting the Hadron Collider up to a certain speed here with the reason it makes sense to me that\nIf they could generate little black holes that could sustain for a certain period of time and they could make measurements that there were any gravity wave moving in to the black calls this is the key\nGravity wave moving in two small black holes\nIt would automatically come from\nGravity waves moving into small black holes it would automatically come from another dimension and that was it seemed to me a legitimate or just based on all the reading that I have done with on kept thorns work and others\nAre I at least rocked what it was that they were proposing now that's one of the tests that was laid out a in paper or to do two or three years ago\nAnd there were headlines in the u._k. daily sensational newspapers and others that\nCERN was going to be making black holes that would destroy the earth that many black hole we're not going to destroy the earth in any way shape or form um there are probably many black holes being generated and moving away all of the time everywhere it was designed\nAnd that this is what's important\nThe Large Hadron collider is a great test or of hypotheses having to do with gravity and dark energy and dark matter and dark black holes in all of it and that's what it is designed to try to do and it's not very easy and so when there were these\nReally terrible headlines about many black holes being generated that we consume the earth\nIt was just to me it was frustrating I Can't imagine what the poor scientists feel like and it's not true\nAnd therefore we're constantly getting ignorance and the Web that in many ways is turning into a cesspool where people are making a quarters and pennies on click through on any hysterical headline that is not base with any kind of fact\nAnd unfortunately we have a new administration that has been pushing all kinds of attacks and uh their claim on false ... a fake news is causing fake news and so this is a very very difficult time and I'm just going to the to the best of my ability\nTo try to keep putting one foot in front of the other end amassing as many facts as I possibly can and hope people will always know I Am fighting for truth and light\nYou assure Alan and you're born Michigan Hi Allen\nAnd how you doing jarred great good to hear from you were to do the same ground that's for sure we sure did\nA version Linda Yes sir I just want to just say thank you for your integrity in your reporting well thank you I Try really hard I'm sixty five years old and I've been following you for a while he seemed ... listen I'm\nGoing to oh I Need first of all I Need your email address we've got to talk to her [laughter]\nYou know it it always think of a reporter who files news about the earth so it's earth files one word e A R T H F.

G. L. A. and the\nGeneric version of it at ... this is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like distilling the soul of the human body\nAnd at this point Ross took his life\n[noise] over the course of a\nEarly in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life to take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred\nOf this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise] um and on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there as he passed away\nHow old was he just he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful but on the last attempt ah he used a gun\nAnd at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marketing of a year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... my biggest nightmare of course as a parent to lose your trial before before you go\nIn or I could only see what you were going through at the time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nOr want to tell our audience this little secret a city here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now you mentioned that you don't use the sun roles\nUm was a you know just a delightful young guy and he's ... use the name Gabriel of course you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they you know send that out one this and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ... and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph\nWas born in these weird ... started coming up all over again in ... and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession in Avi aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that in finance is communicating with me\nWhat message do you think Ralph is trying to\nYou have that the infant it's is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise]\nI find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not just life on earth for him has seized but the existence and the cosmic soup if you will does not stop\nAnd that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I I was going to say you must you in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere\nA in trying to get you little messages every once in a while now just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better course of a year and a half [noise]\nI've not touched it it always keeps the correct

the car and you look in a license plate did you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a work for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you you didn't request it [noise]\nBut I don't

the life of his son roped into ... cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\nWell George I'm I'm definitely doing better\nOne of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with\nHow I think of the finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have this ability but I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body the finite zone for the ...\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone\nAnd I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this is happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really due to the second is three strangers courage to want to go through each one explained to us what happened to us about the situation there so about\nEight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off\nAnd I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\nI Love about one with the balloon what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret and then you had the courage with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our\nHome rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nWith the light switch back down put it back up put it back down they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got ... about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from\nFrom every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask because friends they would portray just the most honest\nI'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand to take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the\nHospital I I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood and he was out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there how did you get that cool\nWell I got the call after the medication had been given to them about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to subculture for you know let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we can look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from there the synchronous cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we have to do it this\nIs not a nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven where it's divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well uh you know the first thing was we noticed my initial PR his ... pi I'm his mom's name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... his\nAdoptive parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the air and the month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\n... let me ask you can why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on may sixteenth birthday okay okay I it was it was better for him and me happened\nThat way and I mean it was it was excruciating to let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one in synchronous these out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther is is is he still with us Oh absolutely OK yeah he he\nWith me for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on an air force bases hay in than this

Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think is object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light games from earth is that the border between the hyper belt and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell why is it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto\nThey travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky the fact that they're all off in this one direction\nYou can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that are being swept off my whatever the massive look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ... Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers distancing galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planet and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get past quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's\nThat these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something NASA like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally I'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out past Pluto out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers at the inner part meaning the planets that we know of planning nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet is in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii and November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce its existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nI'm always very optimist\nPartner in all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nDoes their you habit to Oregon right from the man who discovered this uh in terms of those ... nations\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the ... cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research projects with these scientists is that I had no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the side and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on a star because Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity and math or it it would have impact on every single thing and that's all\nThat's slowly I would've loved those Zacharias ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that ...\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work\nPiece that I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations with Linda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planets out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive plan it but when you read like say about the ... through scholar and you do that translation that we're a car getting\nDone and you look at the carvings one thing that always is\nConfusing to

time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blanket around the earth and at the United nation\nMany countries especially the worry about being Ireland and we see level rise could flood and display\nPopulation they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change often known as the eye can see the and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impact on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty fifth ... only three years ago and the parents agreement on climate change many small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that\nThe I have committed they're doing a twenty eight team report written by Ninety One scientist from forty country\nThe question was hit him in three great global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October\nThe answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now because if we don't\nIf our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn there will be a catastrophe of massive die offs they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island to coast populations to move\nBut to where the twenty Eighteen I PCC reports said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal it as an industry around the world it

PHD professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the talk of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now island and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately

Bangladesh where the bulk of the population lynched very close to your local Nigeria has huge popular she Roger she level but you know sodas most of the world I Know in the United states also has enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem we're it's one of the nation rising sea levels and melts the ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean and without the\nSure more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and move to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much\nEvacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places there's an island did not speak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nThat we've seen the water come up through the drains into Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding that went very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put up marker so that motorists can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dumped in more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing\nOver the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models projected\nYes the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen ... that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a worry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized\nBased on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the dead below you know we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight teen what would you prefer jak we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions\nAnd receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nAnd the more heat waves everywhere around the country and will even seat extremes

the an experience or meditate or how they had any insights about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science which said that\nUh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six and which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is\nTwenty six in which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that they're going to be like a shift or a joke\nAnd then it would cause the nominees in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know what that is written about in general\nAnd that is how ... and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that that information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on ...\nIf you are in the military government ... category or human abducted category and you

bedroom apartment\nAnd it's two levels\nYou have to go up the stairs we get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother in two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just they are in in the dark\nCouldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet about it and hearing the cars that's how I knew\nIt was very late at night 'cause I didn't ... year cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light up like light in the sky high so it was an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky\nI notice something was coming down there by the time my notes it may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was an or\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nLook like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it wouldn't be innocent were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the saw white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in a small white began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say it was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so thin it like you're looking at a seafood for long nobody seen\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that's a person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this week that\nThe only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out the screen and go down there you go on a beach\n[laughter] you know ... ... that's\nWhat I was like man I wanted to go but bombs going to be you do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand that the key is the significance of this\nOkay this is very close to you if you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this was the conversation I was having to myself\nI'd of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my boats at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself\nI was thinking man this personal looks like God\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually pills we go out right then I'll go man you show it looks like the guy because you're a church\nDescribe everything the gal and he was wearing white\nWhen you're looking at this fall white I noticed it was bright or brighter colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall white and black and white I can clearly see that the gal ... white\n... very bright white he was looking up and it was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair and it came down to I'd say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWas his hair straight wavy or curly\nI'd say it was straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures of Jesus have ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color of his eyes\nYou know I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like one ... piece and they went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his feet in this your uncle\nCraft no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was the end and it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole here is kinda strange because like it's you know made it but I could look in the green part it feels apartment buildings on the up and shot\nSo if I'm twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window\nYou are able to look through the surface of the white side of this sphere uncle or or a craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past\nThe line and the white yes and the fact that he blocked out\nThe apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though it appeared very strange to you that he had to have been solid matter or at least blocking so times to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yuma", "day": "26"}
