what the witnesses have described over the decades and there's a scene in one of those\nI. B. movies where the ... the actors playing the very human agents mentioned how all the real news all the good stories get reported first in the tabloids\nSort of hinting that that the agents and agencies are the ones who leak or plant crazy wild stories about the paranormal\nGive them to say the weekly world news it's kinda funny stuff but is it true or could there be agencies government entities that tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor these subjects watch and spy on those who've had experiences listen to the phones follow them around mess with their heads\nThe answer is yes and Nick red burned has put together a new project that pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction files and that's what we're going to talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\n\nMy ... my thought I had I lodged top condition you they'll say look killer who stopped talking kind of horrible\n'em and a a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about\nHow the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments on the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination angle\nAnd I'm a number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example it again in the ... or you have the theory of society preoccupied George King that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm George King Lear theory a society where very much I'm On the nuclear weapons and so falls were opened on them so in other words\nYes we have files opened on the contact cheese but predominantly because they have this political slums or in many of their claims but at the important thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um with non human entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out first of November 'em up secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before it's about a ...\nA ... ... ... the the this is an abduction cases in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance two older level that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio ... claim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm and fraud intents and purposes he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of an Sonia villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio their spouses a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named her love of funds has\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard\nBeing sort of long rectangular and um he had like something on TALK like a dish that were spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise\nAnd that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape\nThey the spinning disk on top of the road to some debate to noise\nSays like the classics out and you get with a helicopter now a mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he ... he didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd the door but he really did evolve a helicopter but they targeted um ... hours he was out of work and then failed lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol\nEr which incapacitated him took came on board the helicopter and the the woman was really that and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was that sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd the the the ... all the story was that the agencies within governments\nThat may well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how this was the fifties love the ... and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo water extends the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say highly ... we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\nThat they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd they kind of just then sat back and wait to to say how much of the story was taken and and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets I think it's something beyond just some alien residents there's military or government involvement yeah I mean they see\nWhere it gets confusing if the you know throughout January and alien abductions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on people who doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a bowling umbrella listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves to nominate so or are they doing both and just not doing\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's some of the things that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more\nThan the military personnel were actually approaching the abduct tastes quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have but I basically the\nThey were asking questions um along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... they have to pay a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishop\n... tell me how um he had to pay to correspond and in the Nineteen nineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an object hey herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all the lectures I wrote to each other back and forth were opened and sailed back down with type\nAnd I'm now they can clearly be done you know age late without making it look like the ... I was taught open race failed\nIt was almost as if whoever was doing they want to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the you up all the old who you know I'm not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous route to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite them with capital ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions that we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons five Seventy one\nJoined the ... the bones have been ... into the means to be moved on ... ... ... [noise]\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a real one\nUm they just seem to be tied to both ...\nAnd um [noise] the Eileen abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that up right\nOutside of government you know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly Malley cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nAnd most faith in government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters\nTurning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes\nOf alien abduction ... and and again kind of light with color to enter and Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um\nAnd be able to to respond at high speed if in the event that they that the fabled climatic options were actually able to catch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... so that very time\nSomebody who's ... tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah the stuff happens but the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone\nDirtiest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um\nOn the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... near the north and I'm bored of the United states and in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences are literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out and it's hard to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bubbles are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is a film coming out about those or it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ because those guys coming out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published a I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case for your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was our store is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out a few um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we'd lives are is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling in\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions\nAnd paypal who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the Iranian Gray's who go the abductions that somehow they have this\nDeep and sort of sinister and disturbing in trashed in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers\nUm and they sort of ties in with ... when he climbed that's um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and asked for this this portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly and um\nHe said that was the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of\nObsessive interesting in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed accidentally by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of fuel cell leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of [noise]\nOf tiled wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there weren't on going studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner weary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um\nYou know ... ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says\nYou know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um surveillance of abductees\nYeah it's it's right now the X. files

back into the progress you know we all ask ourselves the same questions or why are we here what comes next is that all\nThere is that the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it\nThat's the yet at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't know the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science\nReligion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book that offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the realities whether or not this reality might lead into others and vice versa in a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled is I was when I read this will be right back [noise]\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works on they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just fourth\nBrain within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorists I don't know um if you are\nYour members of the audience of her string theory but sure Yemen um use me\nSo yeah there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern from the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor some atomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and so on hum and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it's\nIt's between sort of the ... version and wondering version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean\nYou know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange an uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and\nAnd ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists working on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land it I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah ... is a great little book I'm so flatland it's kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nBut it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in ah the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nWay of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so yeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to come into age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of um there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity in Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of worlds could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut I Am it's flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects objects with just linked with say some of them were flat square some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until\nThe climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... inserts itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land horizon sees the appearance of this mysterious object and starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is this better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat land and up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world and can for the first time I see the whole world spread out in front of them though the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and this is pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in in flatland it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher dimension so he's put in jail where he where he stays for a number of years and years and and the story ends with this for flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nThe idea that the high precision flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah exactly exactly he and he was he\nWas very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but ah but the square character did have these wild Boston and I even had the stationary experience right where he saw that there was that there was another space\nAnd while Fox but but the square character did have these wild often and I even had the vision or experience right where he saw that there was that there was another space or direction to reality and I'm so happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to you\nKnow think about the possibility that above our free spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life I'm thinking that our world is the only world but you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors right going through take us into the brick\nDefined were George Nouri speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and click Georgia's calendar\nDay\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted intends an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he develops\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in in the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher these higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and are stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate the Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this this cue these cube SATs together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nAs you documented trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a free the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto what do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it you know they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um\n[noise] no they're writing really become important so modern artists take up these ideas or spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe pick up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter ages is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis you're learning\nThe ... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd become disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James ban it and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings had been ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like the chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nUm well let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how I held this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um your dreams seem to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like this with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams\nAnd in my book ah especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book or there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nI'm not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predict of dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin you know as he's camped out\nUh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then who wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his books\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island\nHe recognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams you notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows who's going to be a volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island Martinique the French speaking island up Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the

D. priest leaves on national Christopher here if you've ever read the pre sleaze or sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books as the head of the wonderful book\nYeah yeah oh oh oh good so you have read it well very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues are been happening is that is with the I guess with the system particularly you seem to still be attached it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their previous to this is why by boat\nUp toward a about time about the issue is\nA time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and then I also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we see that everything is everything is is a sort of ways\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but the time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter that you do an art project or our perception of it anyway so I mean they're just ... anyway you have any comments or thought about a\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come JV Priestley I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions and he reads a hint and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about 'em and he'd comes up I'm into all of his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has um he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time or feeling like he's out of body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience but like many of the letters are still extent still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book especially will be a Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds and Chris white and Tom Petty things as into the break we'll get some more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members ... up the soon to be with other means ... ... ... am including like book [noise]\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um yeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try next for the suggestion that dollar [laughter] for like ... the idea\nRight east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give them a used car at almost a money so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with a date on it and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you\nAnd says where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dreams so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's made a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different means how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also\nA kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is that it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all that does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in and you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions if you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into his own or do you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's much more\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks geopolitical you know you read about a musician and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCartney has written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his head yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists while the same kind of stories some of them will talk about during some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from\nSome of them will talk about different there ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Kris

I don't know if you know ... and stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion are\nYou actually has a new book I'm I'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and go on the other so he I think Whitley has come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well but they're so\nThat the connection somehow you know maybe departed spirits um our aliens or aliens or depart spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program a crush on him looking for his actions and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kinds of subjects as well whether there's a connection you look at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the

there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm I prefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologists and theoretical physicist that that there is a multi birth you know which is\nUm and that's another fantastic scientific concept that there is not proof for

are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you can do on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I you know different people get difference in our responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like to connect said and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot side creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nA site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when they were ... when they ... from the same soaring around the\nThe skies above ... point pleasant he also had a lot of and cancers we the men in black and UFO in Kansas so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mom and the dog men and things like that I think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology all courageous aching because I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big for vanishing in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not they don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a wet well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seems to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never got to reports\nOf someone you know literally\nShape shift the like in you know American have over ... ...\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog man type creatures said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Bob and just seeing that random\nYou had one where ... ... that was from a military base not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a a British a bicycle royal Airforce helped them re and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working I'm overseas or you can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presidents this was a high to the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot type creature was it not for five the just the the face was very different\nTo how you're describing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big full body with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise]\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should know creates a story like that will fabricated story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean he's a background in the middle a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are record these huge dogs I mean right down to ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic and that you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those with the the dog was\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal votes you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel hand of the ... he actually base his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of the many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much longer much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs he would either made that you would die\nOr you know a close family member or friend would die I'm On the ... the dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs\nIn the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nI'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases\nSo one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and ... you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the spirit of\nDogs that was a slave I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirit of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life um shut\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain to the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there and well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nThere are these large black cats roaming around the a K which simply by explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland these hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist\nYou know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every race actually the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about is the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could\nBe the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we'll be right back\nDo for you to watch a TV show beyond belief with George ... simply go beyond belief dot com [noise]\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nAnd somebody had seen this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible man thing Nineteen Seventy seven it serves a ... wages in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story you know I guess appropriate for um Halloween and there's a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like a man in black\nAnd not many black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies\nBut the rail many black I'm much weight of a sort of very pile and skiing eight and don't and look entirely human they sort of almost look ... found pile like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... secret agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of hands Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd this creeping manning black time towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was you know they was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said it was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nYes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy\nFor ... that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really for garbage or lost it and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset will things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how we would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man's stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed it predates bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think you you know plays out in the men's I wasn't and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid\nA few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how money in black and also a lot of of the amyloid they and cancers and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses out of the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called the or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River an Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal\nAnd various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the law firm on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have to really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nEven caused the disaster and the deaths all that it was sort of um a warning and to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and an ... look\nI'm that's still very much debate you bought divided upon you know to this day but um there's also an English equivalent of eight known as the ... which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings in a a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John Diamond says looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace a chicken investigating the al ... stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close

least\nI mean I you know different people get different responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type of you which is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like into connected and by that you know you have a lot of reports wet paper\nBut he chose on in the same location and timeframe\nOr say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties um when they were ... when they come off from a sane soaring around the\nThe skies both both point pleasant he also had a lot of encounters with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures that like some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that I think\nI'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology little creatures seeking because I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big for vanishing in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes

book the book monsters are several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cats sheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has\nChanged into a Web well from a regular person you know that's\nSort of all the the Hollywood imagery but the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports\nOf someone you know literally\nShape shift the like in American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog men type creatures have said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where we'll need that was from a military base not each leader in more recent time remember that yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce ... and uh I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\n... an American guy but it's working a overseas are EFL can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of vices which had\nI'm an American presidents this was a high to the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot type creature was it not for the five that just the the face was very different\nTo how you describe an ape and it was more like a lung muzzle reporting today is very much like a a gym\nSo the big for about a with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise]\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean he's a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instant where people are record these huge dogs I mean right out of the ... you make that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic you share a couple of those start with the dog\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal votes you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel hand of the ... he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically I'm much log much larger than regular dogs are like these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dogs eat with either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the unlike the dog mine are often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs\nIn the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm foreign nations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like the old case he's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gone the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things oh you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big that lived there well now you're\nRight and that they become known as a bases Ireland big cats\nAnd again every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of people saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or a menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from ... but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the\nProblem is there are these large black cats roaming around the a K which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom\nOkay which simply explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England Scotland need\nThat many reports you know there must be in colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race and dominant thanks [laughter] okay\nWell we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations on a moment talking with Nick red burn about his the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we'll be right back\nAnd this is a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pay for the post and somebody saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better way to use the words are at high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the story\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services in a window of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story you know I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named cherry and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with ... I can only call like a mommy and black\nAnd not many black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies\nBut the rail many black much weight of as sort of very pile and skin eight and don't and look entirely human they sort of almost ... ... and found pile like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... sacred agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry telling me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend and this creeping manning black time towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... I was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFull costume that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man's stories in the lead the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people different times but as a harbinger of doomed to come and it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think you you'd that plays out in the men's I think the point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any\nFat and when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity\nUm the

research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race a chicken investigating the all my stories\nAbout things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized\nFrom his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over him every

more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened or\nWhether this credibility to those ... what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity\nUm some of these like monster stories you know the the welfare decide things for years and then suddenly there's you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of um on glee feel like you see sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they have that perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that wave of

without the\n[noise]\nUm you know [noise]\n\nUm [noise] I guess the ones who hold out [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWould you help me into ketamine is a\n\nFrom coast to coast in worldwide on the Internet this coast to coast am with George nap\nNow here's George\nPink Floyd hey you from the wall brings us back into the progress you know we all ask ourselves the same questions or why are we here what comes next is that all\nThere is that the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the yet at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't\nKnow the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the reality is whether or not this reality might lead into others and vice versa in a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled as I was when I read this will be right back [noise]\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works um [noise] they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seemed simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact justice skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members every audience have heard of string theory\nBut sure I'm using\nSo yes there string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to make make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern govern the universe their\nString theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have\nHad a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and San ... and these are Einstein's theory of general relativity we we know both of those\nWe also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean\nYou know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and\nAnd ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah flatland a great little book I'm so flatland it's kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nBut it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so that you know math students all over the world still read flatland as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live and uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity in Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional to mention the world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut I Am it's flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects objects with just lengthened with say some of them were flat square some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax\nThe world and of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world\nUntil the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in in in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his fight with the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to him and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the first says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is there some better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world they can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them though the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of years and years and and the story ends\nWith this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow a anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lives right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but up at the square character did have these wild up and and I even have the stationary experience right where he thought that that was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm ... I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um\nThat we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about and one to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we will jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it and as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are you talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions ah the doors re going through take us into the break\n[noise]\n... speaking ... school down to the bottom and you were just human nature\n\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level level or worlds to reality I'm hesitant in terms of an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nHe kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned um\nAnd then he starts to think you know well what if these woods these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues ... shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you got the yeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter ages is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning\n... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got ...\nAnd and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes\nAn atheist or like many like many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James van at and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings you have any or it out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else higher reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation bucks and we have people like the ... with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also was soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nDoes that surprise him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams or what what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin you know as he's camped out\nUh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In the of battle and these kinds of things but you would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island recognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams he noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting\nBut the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's he's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French\nThey don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nNot a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island that Martin ... the French speaking island of Martin me\nUm and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dream how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google M. J. W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had towards World War one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29"}
