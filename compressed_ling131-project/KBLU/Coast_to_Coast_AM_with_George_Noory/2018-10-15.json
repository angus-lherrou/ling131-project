you can get to his website right now at coast to coast am and click on it and in the papers section on the right\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back late Cathy\nYou like that do you like to the area okay\nA day or I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you place great for me to keep it up by now\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored collar just at the end\nOf the first question is who is credited with Jimmy ... or the deciphering\nAnd learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is all Howard graphics found go back ... happy and Egypt in that area of the world the same hieroglyphics that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nThat is the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff lipic inscriptions in Beckley taffy is that what you're asking\nOr you know I'm asking is are the Howard graphics that are written and all the ... and Egypt the one with a pair of ... and so forth and go back like that the all the same hieroglyphics that are found on the pyramid is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions in Quebec you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right\nIt'd be jumping Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones that go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H M the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know right there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby are they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go back to happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it the army's age on the bells whether it looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWill do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me very it was right there but it just disappeared\nI mentioned it later on in the show thank you very no problem thanks for al ... absolutely\nAnd uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is a it was going to\nGo to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen at great ... and ... and I I guess I have to apply clay and I'd like to know if he\nHad looked at any of that highly effective but the highway of any age and I and I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they have if if if I'm correct on that particular one\nThe second part and I'll listen over there and whether he and and and the hobbit and and shot had said that some of the um\nThe African African American ballet who study the net net net too at a week the name of the language which is is that ... that you know a\nPhrase itself with say quit and whether he looked at people who call themselves a cabinet for and that in the kitchen you know before they\nThat Greeks came in and consider themselves if they can that colleges cabinet is where we got away from like Tennessee and also um the what you call thing was that what you would think we Scott came up with and to me [noise]\nWhat they define with the little it's not what it is and the African American dollars that I'm thinking that they call it a little uh\nTime will oh God oh cat if you follow them I'm not quite an outlet in over the air\nThank you my dad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... of any but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... century actually in my\nBook um because on the reverse of the eagles piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's next Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this isn't a ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about a pious that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two um UGA\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto and brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with a mia with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a picture all so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the ah the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south than that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting uh the entomology a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned is saying so uh my uh we we think that things may eat before uh before Crawford game I think there was a we think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's\nAll Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr guessing I my new saves on day his paper is right there click on his website it goes to them we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\n\nOne more guest log on to ... am done [noise]\n\n[noise]\nArizona State university offers over one hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree and see what on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled class the one line except for the most transfer credits for information that's lived to three five five line seven\nLearned for yourself ... ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to drive with Arizona State university for more information about ASU online tax live two three five five line seven that's our our V E two three five five line seven\nFive sixty gene B L U [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBack to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess in a ... minute save Saturday more talking about uh the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week on how to locate them and I want to say really\nI expected this ah is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a Jay ... radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim she says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to hand in\nHeaven yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title age of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically a the the coordinates that Alan just discovered\nA fall right next to them I stop off in the ... which is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with those Shakespeare and his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have ... next month\nOkay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes as you said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nRight and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun thing Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found is when you get the guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly there's a depression\nAnd the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the uh\nWe've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in and that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick that could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then then let's go out and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detected by them you on scan\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going up words every body of one of seven and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides in a different sickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration does as an older list ration I'm so that it that particular shafted not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words\nThere is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space it designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNo you just got back from Egypt yes and we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which\nUh did help them find this cavity there's new chamber above the grand gallery yes describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the green chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights are these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created and and you on as\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones\nYou can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X rayed a pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone and so if you have a space in the pathway of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive\nThere then you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors played in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [laughter] the chambers that you were proposing in the ever happened to me\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts you all\nAnd I think they using this angle to confer that's a big voice is real but it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that there could be some some of the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nYou still coffee on me and I still look amazing during the break out ... so I think it's time for me to move on I got a great resume and I absolutely crushed in interviews okay let's make this a clean break

day we're talking about his new paper that was published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls him more with find new when we come back after this short break this is coast to coast am [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts a move all was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the roasted ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the recall it was the ...\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that should be just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that there are ... the our space is under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um that might be something in it that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to all bleed drill right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have lots of marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so\nDidn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map to guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one\nFine map the space and we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around you are quite a while it would just be great to finally a witness to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find that chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to\nA very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter\nAnd I have heard that it does things may have\nBeen a woman's phase and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think we think\nIt was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in this there before and the head of the line this was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little

people are following this\nBut it you know there is one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain to us\nIt may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um\nAh through a Clinton fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line right Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for a minute\nA absolute on her speech you guys really quickly a notion struck me when you talk to you wrote structured space lose a look and make it quick a couple of quick jumps and laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architecture mall a tremendous job dreams super big jump starting to turn players a farming old knowledge building big garbage structures\nOr who's to say I mean you really I mean do you know I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods are solid but could they not maybe just your city is structured spaces be are filled with Ford's\nRajiv on rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities like a temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly the conclusions are that by news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention sharp yellow dog so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me or you know here we have to pay for\nA but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of cool pool it's it's it's hot space is inside researches in his sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... mid ... only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about

first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry hum a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a er into them in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's says I heard that surgeon tools were found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or

um\nOkay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance\nFor architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking for just ... I think because there is obviously I'm ...\nI'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking for just ...\nI think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers so I was thinking well what if it's your logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently up all this are they are the ... was known for the center of the worship of the nine major gods as kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of the year these\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy both in their uh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found\nA but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nHelp the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean ... that's right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... but today you can

only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they're going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll

I see the south side yes um there is\nA ... or so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes\nUm and ah but\nI mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think ah there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looks down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood and he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down\nAnd as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I'm no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel\nYeah I no matter what I personally\nLifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side of the rear flanked by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about the veracity I think that there is there's there are spaces under the things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean and is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was right and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high wash who had denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential\nFrom the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course these Republicans are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are laid kingdom but the the\nLower level is much older we we don't really I don't think we know for sure and it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the axis is on the south side of the ... of ... causeway uh and then that's how ... and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had the ... submerged in water and the surrounding the base and that sort of the shape of the ...\nFor a house I'm a and a and you know they had this or cough or goes inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating um you know this ah some the symbolism of it but they're dating of it I I'm I'm a little bit doubtful about the EU officials story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the pillars that were surrounding the area where there are ... again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... the plateau in there it was\nThat's right and so any inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the meant dimension of the house of Cyrus or on the inventories steal it actually may be referring to through that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's ...\nOr Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to\nA no official called um ... cop or something like that I Can't remember the name but again it's just the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older too and then it was being intruded on\nDo we do I do think we know\nOf ... before we had to the break or how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert's favorite place to look would be a besides\nThe you know uh besides that left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things that could be in front of this thing's temple and then the other thing is we I predict in towards the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the ... of course everything basing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been for reasons would the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot of that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction then is represented in those are the original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nA with a huge trends and this oval ... placement\nUm but there's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows where we are going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this coast to coast am stay with us\n[noise] um [noise]\nNever missed a

and\nAnd listening to an answering all of the questions from the coast listeners not only\nA via the phones but of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing this is great yeah it's just it's such an important time for research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up\nA some a bitch mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last segment here let's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA good morning I knew for thought hey mourning mourning James\nUh good morning Larry and how were you in the hurricane were you okay\nUh where I'm located or my God me but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but it it it it was as such a wide big storm that it it it it affected everything up north they're\nAh I feel sorry for those people but yet they've lost everything\nYeah yeah so you guys were okay over an outside world were\nGood on that side we've got a little whether book brain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nYou're something quick or Edgar Edgar Casey reading Edgar Casey on Atlanta is a paperback\nRight it might be interested in reading and do you does life reading a first printing march Nineteen sixty eight right he talked about between ten thousand eleven thousand period um there was a migration of the carpet in return\nThey invaded and conquered Egypt one of the leaders of this trial was raped or Edgar Casey\nWith reincarnate it of course\nI'm ... all are wanting to say was basically the chamber of the ... chamber it is not a to write a according to written as you might check that out if they do it's very and lightning and the original capstone with court\nUm ... the pyramid pyramid has granted in it which produces under pressure five electricity and you may know all that's already happened and maybe we're done that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nProduce energy the tell your occurrence earth currents of the Nile is rerouted did route uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it was to generate a electricity\nWell Larry let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question are you ready if I can answer your absolutely\nIn the uh you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator power in energy all of that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to uh provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly\nWhat a Christopher done a as said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely covered by\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that as he you know if I if I were to do an investigation he'd be the first call to have him on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing I absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nHi Hi Carol hello Carol\n... for several years ago\nIt made national news twice that they found some artifact and thought oh man found the Cleopatra him on art with underground oh did you hear anything about that\nThough I as far as I Know it I I\nI haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of every third grade [noise]\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explain to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I'm a you know a source affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to as a they have to review the application and they may say no\nYou don't have a recourse um you'd also will have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay if somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can

the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening\nI Am your host Jimmy church and tonight my guess is my new save Saturday\n[noise] everybody let's get started listening to me everybody wants the gift that keeps on giving that special gift won that\nAnd forget about no [noise] it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that and for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd everyone on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly at true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years that allegedly\nAnd yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain has pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I have relatives nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred\nYears to figure out the language and you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know and just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing I'm with you a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything was in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the things and punished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds that three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid first of all of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows that dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this\nThe book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it um as far as we know before that\nPrevents were built if there was this things then it said it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the lying is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then\nYou know or at the um\nI think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting at breakfast at night I knew I only you know I\nHad to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the and one of the games are my two in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything [laughter] he loved to go didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the you want to answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that to him do is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of them it's called ah the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the copper is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and Google's pyramid was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou're going to the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction and forget about the other something about how was builder who built in ...\nReference to to point is in the direction and forget about the other something about how it was built or who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what is the writing the way he describes it it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were hauling up the box but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream seller is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream fill up between the positive things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to ... but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it does definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the drinks are like the image towards the ... all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when Cooper can't what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the U.S has very unequivocally Kuiper came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen and you would say\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast damn our nearest you'd be church against some of my news said his id and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up more bugs and I just moved on Tuesday in\n[noise]\nTitled luck dot com home title luck dot com [noise] my sixty\nGene B L U [noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm your church it's the great pyramid all my big beef or we get to the great pyramid\nOur guest is my new save Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory cell and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and end the dreams della\nA top most the forum says mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things his there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question on a so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by things\nAnd these depictions are you know they're on mistake of all so so the answer to this question specific of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the sense that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\nTeam and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this being but build the great pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventories DOMA is saying that he was just to repair guy\nBut he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um we haven't mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most Egypt causes do not accept the inventories de la\nAs a historical document and ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd their specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the comes the combination is bad for him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and they are the verb that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the\nYou know the fires of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the ... talks about to a store and being ... a ship to he's a um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a amazing interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour to ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you ... later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives a pyramid like ooh booze dealing with uh also wanted to use a plateau right there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes\nThere is a there is a reference to a hit\nHere amid the are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is going to the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built up here of it for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a green permits that are on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the human choice though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think the poop shows that she was a princess\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or the ...\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man with the same care right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even\nYou know more complex yeah they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just a comment that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality a you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the caller yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology\nIt's amazing um and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like uh\nUh the early explorers date used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the German just telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nI knew that I had to get support\nNot just for me\nBut for the sake of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me somewhere like myself thinking\nIt was hard to open up at first\nBut

planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west\nThirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read Hi Howard lipsticks nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... in in focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the aligned mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know and just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years and\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section everything listed in the rope a new was first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a rubber ball and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and polished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid first of all of the three it was new\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceded that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows when the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things\nAnd there was a a so he was talking basically lots of things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before that prevents were built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that there should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nThe um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona\nSo I met Robert shock and we were sitting at breakfast and I I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the and one of the games are my two in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything [laughter] he'd love to go and tell their story and not only that but taxes in in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool in front of the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that to him do is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of them it's called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the copper is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that ... grade and Google's pyramid was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou're going to the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built into the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to a lot of um you know fifth century but to see you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and here what is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done at Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nIt was to build a ramp up to the park Joe and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dreams do a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn left um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream fill up between the positive things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to ... but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it does definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream still at the image towards the ... all the other hand it's very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when Cooper who can't ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the west Side Story under critically what came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen and you would say\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am primarily to be a church or ... minute said is ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nFind them more emotionally just log on to see him\nBust sixty gene B L U [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm meals to mean church it's the great pyramid all my ... be more we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end of dreams dial up\nA ... most of the forum says mentions and in illustrates two things is there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things is there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question on a so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things are and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these pictures are ... you know there are unmistakable so so the answer to this question specific of course it hasn't been found there\nIs there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build off so they're they're apparently was a physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but it's there are things buried under the fence or let's say west of a conference here that it's possible\nThe\nIn stories to LA you had mentioned that uh\nSo that he repaired this things but builds agreed pyramid there are others that have interpreted the image ... is saying that he was just to repair guy\nRight and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um we haven't mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most Egypt pauses do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so it to your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pat him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of tax where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and they are the verb that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the fires of rare that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the powers talks about to a store and being ... or ... or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and ah who was a ... interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I to be that that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramid was dealing with uh also one of the games are so right there would be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is a there\nA reference to a head Knutson 'em and hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is with the news and so she was supposedly is clean\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a green permits that are on an indie east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the mentors though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the ...\nBut\nIn human tourists there like it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess ... again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we've we think the poop shows that she was a print says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus other Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they are saying\nYou know if this were an old ... story or at the time of coup who he's got a you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man's with the same care\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah but they're not in their ... stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality or you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old getting them\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and the and what I like about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill holes you didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kinda like the German just telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me without destroying me

blind LBJ but um\nSix foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the most crucial and um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was inclusions\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there is another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that yet though are spaces under this beings\nAnd one of those bases specifically which is what Robert shock or or was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that self interest\nYeah you did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to bleed room right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced a size Margaret fee and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I of us in marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them and of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really find map to space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then work try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this rumors going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally a witness to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and sinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project\nBut it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly speaking of this\nIt's a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and is there before and the head of the line this was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it

article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum field\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international

space lose a look you're making ... couple of quick germs laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma ... super big jump starting to term papers are forming old knowledge building big garbage structures ah who's to say I mean you really\nPeople in the ... the ah periods are solid but could they not maybe just structured spaces be are filled with Ford\nRajiv or the rocks\nAnd everything you know arches inside big cavities like temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly\nThe conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we've mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on budget sticks basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scandal was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be theological and shop you're dealt with probably disagree with me or you know you have to pay for\nA but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of course who it's it's as high spaces inside research is in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid budding coffers pyramid all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back or gas my new stateside hey this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us Mm\nMm\nWe\nPay shipping and handling just dial hounded two fifty on your mobile

to a head straight back to it that Stewart let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nWelcome Monique how are you there\nOkay I have to do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary Europe next on coast\nI'm Around how how let it to you and your calf\nI'm kind of something like four years older under\nAnd somebody was shining and man standing there with the sword from the garden of Eden and he just don't think there's a block and building it and the native came over and they said how are you doing that he said I any that I Am in that town now\nI think that is involved like\nA tree of life\nIt seems like off the Bible and the tiny round in Egypt Abraham right in there for fade have found that in their kid man in the area there in case a man in there and um the lion the genesis where um they hated the woman will crush ahead of them the evil why\nIt just sounds like that and could that possibly be the original thought in the garden of the\nAh that that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry hum a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a a a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the the the whole knee if I remember this correctly um but yeah\nTo read a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly um but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think uh there is\nFor specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's as I heard the surgeon tools were found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a ... Dickson\nUm and he uh and it's now in the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a surgery with you and other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here um it's\nIt's good to build up in Oregon bill you're up next on goes down to my new\nName on their ... you had the really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate on but if the chamber's or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance\nFor architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think\nBecause there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that\nSo in the ... ah the ah the hopeless was known for the center of the warship often nine major God's it's kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy worlds and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm oh I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been space is there that helped the workers\nThe top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait till next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean in terms of less right\nWhich has dropped off I have heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the gives a plateau but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's up blood toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt she areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] ah that's a good question\nIt is a great question it's a great question the question\nUm [noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany\nUm there there was of course German activity on Nick he's a plot so there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the ... uh George rise and or from Harvard and a\nAnd ham on your own car from a from the German a fun life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted a and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a show out east in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow you doing Jimmy I'm doing good Joe say Hi to my new\n[laughter] Hyman knew how I got to take your\nGood uh yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that there are any any tunnels or underground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids into vicinity and also can you tell me whether\nThere are any signs of blueprint", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "15"}
