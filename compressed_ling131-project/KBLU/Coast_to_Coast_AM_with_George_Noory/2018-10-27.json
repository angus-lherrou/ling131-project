[noise]\nWell you know with a book like the end of life as we know it I think the bumper was pretty predictable it's like a law uh but still a great dog after all these years Michael Gilliland\nIs the author of this a book the end of life as we know what I'm In his news from the frontiers of science we'll we'll get back to some of the other things that he's concerned about the book is not all doom and gloom ... pretty exciting fun interesting things that are coming from the frontiers of science and then a couple of things you want to keep\nAn eye on I'm saying what about you are and uh it it\nWill be the end of life as we know what life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just a minute also will bring you in on the conversation at the bottom of the hour we'll give the numbers at the bottom of the hour the next hour we go to open lines because it's friday Georges ...\nTo hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\n[noise] we've got a great feeling story part of or in the house one of\nThose botanical that it's so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue or whether\nLight the light bulb went on and I started to research on down and say it was like yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing him back and it's almost eight years now\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nThe chick ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so\nWe're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that the Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at all my way way putting them which was a mechanical hard in a human being and you know I was in South Africa right and yeah and and and and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on\nOr were even getting past the mechanical hearts\nHey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are\nNo you know the minute you University of Minnesota's mustard recently had a huge research you it's a it's an are one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I just I don't know why it just gives me an uncle but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... they're\nSheep human and pick human ... so these are\nWhose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question\nToo much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nBecause of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little bit like I said\nWe really wanted to and what's interesting in is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers and says yeah that's that's a real possibility that does not like\nYou know made up the pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the end I H this kind of very um\n[noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nFor the guard rails I'm sure that I'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of you know you should probably doing it against the advice of the moms [laughter] what do you do yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was ... when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found on my mom's kitchen and I look back at\nHow [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\n[laughter] and I don't know I Would filled\nBalloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens after\nA while I was a little mad scientists and area [laughter]\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mother that say why don't you know I get I write about filling that already go this is all play tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I just thought I'd ... standing\nFifteens any game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of works and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... because that's how that's how it's happening but right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and\nWe're we'll keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island of Dr ... pretty scary it really is but I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on a window Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... by me some you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of assist and I kinda get it\nBut there were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about it and that's the other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell\nThe story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know this a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... Alexa now are you\nKidding me why take away I mean you know leaders [laughter] yeah I Know it's\nSo big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael Guillen um the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMay be there in the Saudi constantly that they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whenever there and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet\nHowever it happened that kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I just had an op ed that it will be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities that something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nBig or that kind of a that your ... your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you\n\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we can because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could mess and the [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and\nOr the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of the deceased woman wearing a fit that was one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fifth\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculated how many feet she walked\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nOut at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life that can\nTell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you walk what's your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on ourselves than\nWe are well these gadgets yeah and I liked till a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week the same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh did you know they always do you know\nRipped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ...\nThe hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test\nOf this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having as this humongous\nDatabase of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're covering\nThe yeah and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy running with which raises the possibility that you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their data base\nBut the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and to finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this ... what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me a perfectly\nGood a knife on my own turned back up\nTo go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah drive a cart have a couple\nA great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'd be great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things [noise] um one of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nA heart open heart it'll obviously that was a heart lung machine and Dr wrestling Nelson a worked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I had some paranormal experiences wanted which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if a ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions that he was able to see him his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like ... did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm I'm Wondering wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me do it because I knew that we have our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to a tree see who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\n... Michael I got one question for you here where does it end where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we it's a good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book and ... and it's a very telling quote\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but ... when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who's in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with the nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nCan really within right that but it was everything else\nTwo of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural on the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid the phrase although I Know it's a popular place for it\nRight and that's what I'm saying and it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing\n... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire\nOh totally I what\nI was the first television correspond to actually find my way to those oil field\nOr a a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get their way through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think a crazy question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one line that's going to do with them\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I if I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just gonna blow us up\nOkay we're Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I met in okay\nSo you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you\nWhat I think is a better metaphor though for a for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say that the goal is the other

Mohammed was and there was a famous religious leader hey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYou know a very interesting things I hadn't heard that about a Alaska Alexis but and that's how they programmed or to to say that\nThere's of course wrong and and not accurate I'm not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people who are atheists to study the subject come to the conclusion by and large\nThat he wasn't a historical figure uh\nBut uh it's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like something that they would do in Silicon valley though doesn't it uh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey and coast to coast am Mary\nAround how are you tonight I'm going back to your guest I'm ... ... people get this couldn't a I possibly that's well that's a great question the ghost in the machine [laughter] about like a robot and all ... that's [laughter]\nYeah that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession you know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it's\nIf it's just a a a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul that it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that a inanimate objects\nYou know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach ... place for you know a ... spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area so they become attached to a thing\nSo maybe not in sold as we would say like there's an instrument possession but who knows you know that's where I live coast to coast you all are always bringing up and there were thought to Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah let's say I'm a I remember when you're on the drama and\nWhat was my drama um [noise] yeah\nWell that's how it was like man took my tonight is yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in this world that really loud and I really really really like\nI think you have any right when our al ...\nCame out with two weeks I just walked around [noise] and I I ... and I mean on like\nSaturday when I get ... or ... yeah some day in time can keep you know\nIt seems that there is certain people that are so beautiful it's so wonderful and their own lives and it just kills her\nOwn you know what ... I think you're why\nWell you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it is you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over that we just just just cut us off guard\nSo yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have you lived in Ohio with\nThat and\nThat that's just say quick might want there it's the right test here oh cool\nToy and I grew up I you know\nI grew up around radio stations trends that yeah\n[laughter] so I Would never did that start track that oh I Know\nAnd get to do is just a kid they\nSay oh my God it's a\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of shit what station did your father worked for a\nWhile he don't Cape deal Iran\nAnd cats\nAnd they were where um\nIt simply shit I was like oh here I think you have a great night I I've always worked I'm not that ... advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about\nEngineering on something like that but I Love you engineers who really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds the none nothing\nI'm All right so that brings me to oh Keith from Virginia is back so he had called the um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back so you you had a friend who it was you were telling your story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experienced declined is\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what you do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct as I understand that and um that individual by the way and and ah thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit a quicker and smoother with everything but um somebody very topic for eight discuss and and that related to some of the things I wanted to say too but this\nGentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relates to experience that of a failure or twice in surgery which is patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visit to him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to\nTheir parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same rough I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three after having been on a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left 'cause world renowned medical career a\nBecame the president of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more in hiding from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph now revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other this or that he had profits\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds usually go ahead and said\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man\nBecause a lot of those principles seem to have been lost by you know\nThe church from the council on YouTube and some of the scriptures and the boss that were the basis of the creek\nUh LDS scholars to sort out um\nBut that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends who LDS oh\nOh so so many not means somebody playing little game like hey look at me\nLike I'm Around here every now and then you know and I'm going to move around it\nThat way they manage forests this one at all the pairs correctly and and the and the jar container so they're all facing out towards\nOr they get there it would just have their own fan right there\nYet but the thing of the ... moving of the ... I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in the ... the ... in this little cup holder who'd you just start moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled their guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory\nTo a a back in a ... is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow Hi and I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I hear all\nThe first things first the first things first thing I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that is easier\nTalk right now for a second look at Ron I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that next for other options and other things out there because\nYou know I just I don't know that's that's the way I'd help inside an them higher gas Michael I'm closer to when you first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe ... yeah that later tell\nThem to read the Bible and now he's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong religious stuff exactly but I'm\nA little bit like I I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how we can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um you know like\nI said you're our hero type figure if they run a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ... trillion in tax from like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ... you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true is that we know to be\nA worse steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest I\nFelt that you know story that can be found in other places we can still try as saying like the other information on the vinyl\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible\nThere's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow come to think of that let's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nAll I'm not here to thanks sound good [laughter] good\nWill be ... be a hope you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey yeah and it's nice to be on my list that river river actually called and I have you know wanted to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but or do whatever you want to some more scientific stuff\nYeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people carpet yuan mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and\nI only smoked ... yeah they're\nThey're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is uh that logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a stabbing addict augmentation and stuff and uh\nI really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around\nYou know we have the ability to do the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free you know and uh you know what would that\nDo maybe to the educational system where we go to school but we just make philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nI'm you know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take just have to write it or it can do it if it's not that it's dance you know or something so I'd like to dance to offer you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine\nYes some big entity whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I only\nVenus is are you know I Am reminded of that stuff is very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small am in a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered\nMostly what I live in a day or something like that one of the fact stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in you'll on mosque\n... right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nVentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think\nAnd he managed to review the not his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview\nI'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching the wheels are going to eat and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I I I think any time the head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think he exposed himself a little more on it in on public but I mean I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a\nThat's a very soon future you know blame ... was based in June of Nineteen you know what I mean not that good but they were mentally getting more technical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff this could be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know who knows what\nAnd when to places

I don't get there very often but one of these days ...\nI'm not help who had only Rio yeah we're neighbors OK\nWell previous caller brought up something about that it up a website where\nYou mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure let that go figure and then they went into my ...\nIt was a Lexus they asked yeah that's what it was\nYeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections and after it got to heart\nBut yes he did say that it felt immediately it triggered in my brain\nBought this perfect set of encyclopedias channel that guy from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and like I didn't know I ended up I might have got it first person to ever open it and I write for\nA first heart the first introductory part and it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nWow ... ... ... if you haven't said that he would probably in ...\nThis was a new format where Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nThe alphabetical volumes and they they chose what to put it at links in that heart and then the index the other selections at their discretion and so when you look at Jesus in this\nEdition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica\nHas just a few little paragraphs and it it calls from them that's a cool figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents there's\nA way to look in the end or more information and then if you turn to Islam it is like page after page after page in the regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting it's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you do now it's\nIn it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really good\nAnd like not even [laughter] you don't know if you did wrong usually do we choose the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said\nI I Know there are still printing the must still be printing a real means nothing done completely they don't want anything\nLast year the second Alaska wow that is to buy it gave them home no worse than they do at home and saw that in fact started looking up things and I thought who is this why did she didn't make it this way and so yeah you can find out I mean if you could do home or a\n... I'm breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night\nUh I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving ... may have to wait a while but moves you what do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska\nOn coast to coast am Karen\nHi um this link and was he was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and I'm In the show was short\nUm first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite show host and that has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because they do that [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just\nYou know what you know I I I guess that it's funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you said you will you know used to say that oh no they don't like what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I don't get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where um the Mandela Effect first of all you've probably heard about it\nThere's a million dollars to memory to\nWill laugh at all they say false memory and everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave was um I Believe it was I say I love and sex and the Bible the wolf and the lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb\nBut a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can find a gift to what I got a catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night that also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like why did I don't know thrower comforter stir remember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father\nBut anyway it was the way we remembered it so look I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father\nUm the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate Sally Field do you remember when she\nSaid her really liked me you like me are right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says she says you really liked me now okay that's\nInteresting when\nNo not when she was saying the encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on it last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know portal into another dimension\n... think demon into our yeah well they were doing St panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and my comment that they eat because we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nThe other things that would certainly do she'll still be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it out on nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to IRS when I'm proposing to do the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and above bendel and about uh Mohammed is that\nWhat we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples um I Will say when it comes to a Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek not from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek\nDitch impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns in people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a pro known and putting a person's name and then others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to find quibble inform the thing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to be ... I ... I Hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who is in Tulsa in the time we have left on goes to goes to a a Marty\nAnd if a closure I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call and the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on [laughter]\nWhat do you think that I had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\nOh so did I [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nThey needed year hey I'm In a discussing a with a couple a gentleman earlier about\nThirty minutes ago or so you had talked about how genius is um is depicted as being murdered and the ... but not in the Bible and I think I'm a seminary student I'm a minister I studied in a couple of different Bible college's and uh\nBecause every time dad like us take a moment like to spend with our kids\nIs pretty momentous [noise]\nSounds like somebody agrees [noise]\nSo let's take a moment to make them\nToday called eight seven seven for dad for one one or visit fatherhood dad go\n... by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ad council [noise]\nFrom the ... our air conditioning and heating studio this is talk five sixty K B L U Yuma\nSuspects past unraveling preexisting conditions I'm Martin eckerd of fifty six year old Florida Man Cesar ... book is facing five federal crime prosecutions in connection with more than a dozen package bombs center critics of President Trump\nThe FBI's director made it clear the packages contain improvised explosive devices and the bombs were no hoax\nThey act passed has been unraveling into the rats revealing a dark history of at least nine Iraq including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports you sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nRats including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh they are also been making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at you and journalists\nEven with the Iraq in custody investigators are stressing it does not mean to strike it's over\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now\nIn plantation Florida Natasha ... reporting\nFor president above a hit the campaign trail for democratic candidates and well speaking in Milwaukee zeroed in what he called President Trump's allies when it comes to promising to protect preexisting conditions in healthcare he's\nPrevent thinking well Justice Department\nNow trying to strike down those protections that is not in not exaggeration\nThat's not what a positive thing\nMGM resorts international has decided to enter sentiment talks with plaintiffs who allege negligence legend the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history on the Las Vegas strip the agreement to see mediation comes after a federal court battle the not the casino giants\nRequests decentralized Thirteen lawsuits [noise]\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published he's publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author so they should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get again eight hundred buys zero one thirty six eighty nine\nYesterday I got a call from the IRS they sing I owe them over sixteen thousand dollars I don't have that kind of money\nGoing by the IRS and your own call us ... they learn if you qualify for the IRS first start initiative\nIf you release pen pals you've always been back back to this poll now for free and confidential packed that then I was calling us back to you about her free ... and I was an eight hundred moral by twelve twenty five now eight hundred ... twelve twenty five eight hundred for all five twelve twenty five\nIn Los Angeles when can lead Jansen gave up ...

who's a getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season with the which\nIt's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive Siri\nAreas story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true and also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James ... some of you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the Bo Sox he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled I'm Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed\nUh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying leery of vampire [noise]\nWhere is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but but ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net of business at just the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that's because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with the brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque it's foreseen is the day when we ... with the use the one of these more on that we can actually surf the Internet\nWith our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a a a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then\nAs I say robots are becoming very realistic we can write about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a a I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when they see the future because what we do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for\nOh is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCan go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh I Know absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about ... I in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the the the\nI think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based and and I think this is in in in the\nIn the certainly in the publicity for the Brooklyn even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been\nReporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect face in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series\nThe facts ma'am right Andrew I that's what I did\nOh fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew I that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot now if you can imagine\nOh no ... I read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final\nChapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like the ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it is so I became a man of faith\nFaith I'm a Christian and I take my ... my faith very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom\n\n[noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is a is just great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like whether that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate was the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive\nUm you know never mind I Try to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I wouldn't just pick that as an example there that's a good way in California right there's a company in California that is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to\nTo benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the wave this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that do the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured it's a late night shows\nSo I Try and she's going to lay you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know they have to say what you said why of us are [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when the stuff hits the fan there I go again only stuff hits the fan\nThey they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on ... ... ... lives in ... ... ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when\nHe said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society did the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nYeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting or by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers\nThis is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure\nI I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he just not just a job and you know he has the right is appointed and his answer I thought he was gonna say oh yeah you know I majored in\nPhysics at college right now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it said I I I Love you\nBringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nWere designed doing work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what were you learn is\nThat oh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a a temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that ... that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some\nSome creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp now and now here's an age now let me ... is a little differently if there was a human's killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nYou know the fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought it back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed that he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles [noise]\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's when I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ...

that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\n\n[noise] we've got a great feeling story part of or in the house one\nOf those botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nStory for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that the Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which was a mechanical hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and you know just and\nAnd and and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past the mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but\nThere you are no you know the minute you University of Minnesota's mustard recently had a huge research you it's a it's an are one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an uncle but anyway you\nHave three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... they're sheep\nHuman and pig human come air so these are creatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question\nToo much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to\nTamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little bit like we\nWe really wanted to and what's interesting in is that these\nGuys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made up the pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is the possibility but they're doing this research against the wishes of the NIH the national Institute\nGovernments number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the anti age it's kind of very um\n[noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and decide that we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nI'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it a violation of the age you're probably doing it against the advice of their moms\nAnd what do you do yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then model fellow of the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found on my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there and the garage at the ... of our how [laughter]\nMaking hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nBelow I Would filled\nBalloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens after\nA while I was a little mad scientists in an area and\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nThat they can marry you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I might not filling that already go this is all quite tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I just thought I didn't mean standing fifteens\nAny game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of works and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors ... that sounds that sounds happening right now still there's two men on and the top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it\nSo sorry Joe ... is the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but\nI I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for which I'm\nYou know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on a windows series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google by ... by ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever in these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of the ... and I kinda get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about\nAnd that's the other thing we're bringing about our cell okay you're a ... if\nYou're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know there's a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson in like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have a mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders of [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and we'll\nIt's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know than it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our community\nEffort the security of our country I just had an op ed that going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that kind of a that your fridge raider your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut\nAnd or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story and the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a that these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit\nFit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nOut at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix said that they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited ... on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked kill a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh they do they always do you know\nRipped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing lead people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the fitbit\nThe hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having the humongous database of face print\nRunning a that they've not you're covering the ... yeah\nAnd and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy\nThey they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy room with which raises the possibility that you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life is we knew it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good a knife on my own turned back up to go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah\nDrive a cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower is called them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine and Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah and some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I had some\nParanormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's as if a ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions that he was able to see him his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a lotta wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it 'cause I knew we had our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of blown so let me go to\nTracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\n... Michael I got one question for you here where ... where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we those are that's a good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human gene\nFree and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book and ... and it's a very telling quote\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your your your pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat can really within right there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we ... a disease\nI I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\nRightly that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in companies all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean\nThat can be said we're playing ... so what I like\nTo do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on\nFine yeah totally I was\nI was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field\nA oh a oil fields that were lit on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see as their I see as navigating a mine field and as you know so far we've been able to avoid to a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous\nNevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine\nAnd it's just gonna blow us up\nOkay remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it comes that way but now I Am committed\nSo you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you and I think is a better metaphor though for a for science in is is we had to get you had you know let's say the goal was the other side of that minefield\nI Am a veteran I lost both legs in Vietnam\nEvery year ... more than a million veterans so they can reach victories great and small\nVictory was getting my benefits and a good education [noise] I'm a veteran when I got out\nI felt like nor will say in my victory was find the help I needed\nBut there's more to be done and more victories to be one\nThing for me I feel like I'm doing it again [noise]\nHelp support more victories the veterans go to ... or ...

age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet jokes gay for a little bit more in hiding from time to time I hear things from coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had\nProfits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture ancient scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and and so you're going to get about thirty more seconds usually go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because\nA lot of those principles seem to than Boston by you know\nThe the church from the council on YouTube and some of the scriptures and the loss that that were the basis of the creek\nSee that way they mention a pharmacist or anyone at all the pairs correctly and ended up in a jar container so they're all facing out towards out or\nThey come and get to order it would just have their own fan right there\nYet but the thing of the ... moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in it goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors independents who the ... in this little cup holder who district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled their guys don't go with that until they've got\nAny other theory to a a back in a ... is in Wyoming on coast to coast Michelle\nOh wow high fencing in I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I lived here all\nHis first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at take wrong I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know it just I don't know that's that's the way I felt inside an entire gas Michael I'm closer to when he first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe England yeah that lady\nTold them to read the Bible and now it's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know have a very strong religious staff exactly but I'm\nA little bit like I ... I Wonder how often\nWhen I'm driving down the road and how we can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I have often heard that a lot of the major stories from it like the story of the ... and the story of a you know like I said\nYou're a hero type state giving one of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like pre biblical tax you know like ... trillion in tax from like the marrying the abalone and you know whatever appreciates the Bible so you're\nTalking about the ... you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the indigo diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of man God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from the divine father and at that\nYou know of that so the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a\nThere's a difference to me and there are true is that we know to be a worth\nSteering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest we buy or\nThey'll let you know story that can be found in on their plans can still try to find like the other and her name on the ...\nWell no here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better\nIt does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on ... worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow common to think of that that's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nIn a long time ... Fowler good\nGood will be a big hope you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with\nYou um I go to a adjusted and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey and it's nice to be on a list them wherever they were actually call them or have you know wanted to take it to the left everybody is on the the religious\nAspect but uh do whatever you want you to the more scientific stuff yeah sure\nI'm not sure if a lot of people carpet on mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I know when he smoked ...\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is uh\nThat night logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a thriving addict augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability yeah these massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the edges\nThe near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just philosophy classes to learn how to properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nIt's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nJust have to write it or it can do it if it's not that it's dance you know or something so I can dance to offer you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine\nYes something against the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I ... on\nVenus is are you know I Am reminded of that stuff is very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly\nWhat I live in a day or something like that would affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque\nMhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nOn his insurance but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money\nAnd so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview\nI'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching it was a we'll start going in and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product I\nThink they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but [laughter] but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use its own genius\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on and on public but I mean I think the thought process and everything are pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yuma", "day": "27"}
