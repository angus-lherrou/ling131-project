I absolutely love than have them a ban has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made it fan passively smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot band has them and um and when they when a cost rally or you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage or the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great plan to fight by and work and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hark and that sort of blend of fantasy side by an alert you see\nIn a lotta later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains of all time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian barb oh great ghost story about um the lepers\nA Nineteen eighty of them come back\nWith a goal the crew the fog uh it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which\nI think was originally supposed to be um Donald pleasant but I I don't know what he what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assume Halloween being one of\nThem are they live being one of them the fog was one of them\nSo I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated\nWonderful imaginative bill\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars from\nYou if you have the right distribution absolutely\nThough so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it and the more interesting than it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the flight I think it's very easy to over produce or I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's ... like a surprise and and if he if he can he the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living\nDead ... grand a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell has made a living doing lower budget horror films\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier oh\nReally is [laughter]\nAnd uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and uh you know he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention you liked the than\nHe likes to check\nThe likes the paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these sort of it's almost like a chaplain where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books not all seemed to have that feeling for in a cemetery and things like that\nYeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie it's just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I I think that a lot of uh my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he's the just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing\nA and drinking and writing and ... finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN going in\nUm which I think allows for him to surprise you know again it there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time\nWell back down to it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think Andrew is one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh there every night of the living at yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see that [laughter] you know\nOr the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the you know the whatever get inside the signs and you know it it's all um it's a ... very

and that\nThey are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nThe newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the

access these non ordinary states have consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to get into a lot of different aspects are really the supernatural image virtual reincarnation things are done you've got some great stories about reincarnation\nOf the books that you roll back in two thousand Fifteen dumped makes life possible told me about the ... how did you come up with that\nWell I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra\nFor a film we made a\nFeature length documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMarilyn let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually all of the world that's the whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that all the cloning is happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish\nHe's crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and preserve it on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nBut on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn hogwash life after death does not continue when we die each schools what do you say\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ...\nThe well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and a nice car using my God\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to as a skeptic is not a known believer skeptical wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew\nThey're the ones who were question wasn't like they get an idea [laughter] things that they wanted to raise the question and I think that's different than a bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI get here I think open minded skepticism is found in perspective if we can have we're in agreement on that it might be our Detroit

possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um just want him to step Bruce march or something like that right well Ian Stevenson\nWas a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience of past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the\nBiography of this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nOr evidence all but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers or I use to change your diapers\nAll and it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid started remembering\nOther things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got a bunch of pictures from\nThe dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding it\nAnd then they were going through some of the other snap shots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\n... truly remarkable you remember the true story of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots\nAnd the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew that other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his ... and the and the doctor ... and uh they took him to a reunion a World War two veterans and he knew several of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the ...\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle man's him and this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets Josh\nAnd they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirit\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror ... to do a lot of this\nAnd try and it's really really strange uh-huh\nLarvae interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you would have Marilyn then you'll you'll get you in touch with her on her website is visionary living dot com you might be able to stream through there\nBut what you're saying even that title for a website is\nReally not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now and you know we know that people are believed different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that\nLeaves based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of ration rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that is going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just\nRationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely or special guest Dr ... we're talking about the really things dealing with consciousness Mueller Sean how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the person\nI think it's a tricky question I'm of course in ... [laughter]\nI don't know that about you George\nI'm I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they define God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while as long as you know if you've ... of course\nRight hell and damnation can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a God per se\nBut there's this idea of you know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm a beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true him very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nThe U.S Jerome production weightlifting can actually increase the production certain

believe is that they just go to church all the time but you know they don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just\nFirst attack when I was seven years old\nI was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says\nJust you know how were you what were you raised ... we were raised as just\nFrom a hard case in your church is right here right in your heart no no no you have to go to a certain church never my dad was my dad was a Roman Catholic my grandmother Nelson was also and they were the Catholic there was tree\nBut he

seem to be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible you know\nBut you know the Bible I I read the Bible to into Bible school and everything but the thing is this happening to me when I was seven years old 'cause like two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell within one and the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock masks on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I can eat also but there are ... well ever getting dark confession done\nAnd I'm I was sitting there at the computer and I\nTell

old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive and so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours\nWhere people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they have these experiences

Gilligan with his hat you know and we were watching a movie like that and I think with a lot of movies that bonding thing you know father son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies the kind of be with my dad and I it would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was the crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl it's embodied hand crawling\nBy itself and I and and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and I'm\nSure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put into this perspective a wait there this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me this is this is something for fun and\nI think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it were ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the ... a fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's ... I like all of that I like uh oh I was younger movies I like ah you know monsters and then the robots and engines and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill the original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean castles how so how do I want a blind woman in the cellar man I thought\nWould really do all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for a while when he just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know he'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know\nOr will be my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure you know in all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a cult in the supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four months\nYou know to the Texas Chainsaw massacre debts has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that old movie\nYou think there is you think there is and I think there is why you know and you go back and you watch it and you know it's all still murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and the the how weird their house\nWas with all the the mode mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they were no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one ... did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet leads body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of ... Mellon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is standing there stroking his chair and watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down having all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... doesn't say a word and as he's walking out the door he just says\nTo stop a [laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit\nEvery single night his job he\nCouldn't handle it has and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people have had a become accustomed to the founders footage\nFirst person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of the sort of found footage type films\nAnd an independent film it went really big and you know when it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director have final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch is supposed to happen and people still\nIn they're looking to uncover this thing that never happens do they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know\nPart do because of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think or Freddie Krueger the nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream scape which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nWith any on any of them whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's kinda weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know what I did not like the bottom do pretty much did it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child and ah they are basically kind of dealing\nWith the grief a of a loss of of a spouse or whatever and a father um and I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know he's got like a top hat and kind of right wing kind of hair and he's a cartoon out of a children's book\nUh I didn't really I mean it it didn't I never really believed that Bob at Duke but that wasn't the part of it they didn't like\nDidn't like that it seemed like a two hours they'll walk commercial where it was just running [laughter] this this allegory for\nTheir depression and their Greece and that you you don't ever really escape your brief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think it's you you sir you won I think there's two there's two aspects to roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to get you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun that you want to get back on it and yet\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in for effort want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you you're safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by so\nYet there's more than enough healthy nutritious food produced right here in America every last hungry

far the those yes to Greg\nI'm what I told you about is or what your thoughts on the fog and Santa has them which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties and\nUh I I absolutely love than has been a fan has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made it fan passive smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot band has them and um and when they when a cost to really uh you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took them almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage or the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think it kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by an alert you see\nIn a lotta later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screened villains of all time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or a\nNineteen eighty of them come\nBack for the gold through the fog or it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um\nDonald pleasant but I I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John Carpenter so Halloween being one of\nThem are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so\nI mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imaginative felt\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom you if you have the right distribution absolutely\nSo so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it and the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see them more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the flight I think it's very easy to over produce or I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money in it and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's thought flu like a surprise and and if you if you can keep the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so\nEat a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead ... grand a are incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell has made a living doing lower budget horror films\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier oh really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I\nYou know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and uh you know he uh he loves a you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check\nHe likes the paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplain where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that poor type feeling for in a cemetery and things like that\nYeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange bulk commodities you know I mean I dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie it's just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I I think that a lot of uh my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps righty he he's the just as surprised as we are because he just\nKeeps writing a and drinking in writing and ... finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN going in\nUm which I think allows for him to surprise you know again it there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of boils back down to\nIts asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film a shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh these everything tonight of the living dead yes and you know now it's kind of come down to the main stream come down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the you know\nThe the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the you know the whatever debt inside the signs and you know it it's all um it's a ... very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know it's a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians too I think that um you know modern zombie movies you know I Know zombie as the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so bad about\nAnd we don't ... you know ... ... ... in the world of you know we're very politically correct world there there there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down with a gun and and have no uh we you know uh\nBack and take some final phone calls and

ever been in touch with our old friend Dr mortgages\n[noise] oh I Would love to talk to more gifts you know I ... I was in his ... my show aired and his market and I got the wonderful stories from than about his show but I you know I've never\nAccepted an award for him once there was a ... hall of fame or in Indiana and uh they were handing out they work they were acknowledging a bunch of horror hosts on stage and they want someone to come up and say something about markets and\nFor whatever reason they didn't have anybody there to do that so I was I I went up and said a few words about longest but you know he he's one of the originals you know from the ice house [laughter] a and a child a it was a chop the\nOr child yeah but yeah you know that's right ... uh you\nKnow he would he would have these incredible experiments on I think he pretty much created the nutty professor template and ah you know I feel that ah Jerry Lewis probably ripped that off I'm a magical ah\nThey may not have been jury but it might have been the producers that took advantage of that\nUh perhaps it but the wacky world of Dr Marcus I think is probably the first movie about a whore house that I Know of uh and uh you know he was beloved in St Louis then in Louisiana\nAnd Detroit a\nDetroit you know and he had he had a he had a a remarkable run\nA and ah you know of course he's always it's always been a favorite of a guest of mine on every appeared on coast to coast am\nI ended up working at the TV station in Detroit that he was working out he had left so I didn't meet him there but he was my boyhood idol I loved the guy\nIn how ... how could you not and then we got to know\nIt was an amazing thing and for ah for Christmas one day my network flew him to Los Angeles from New Orleans as a precedent for me and this was so weird Mr mobile because I was on the phone with him a interviewing him\nAnd all of a sudden his voice got more and more distorted strange\nCan hear him but it was just echo we in all of a sudden he walks into the into my studio [laughter] very ... it was my ...\nWhat a great trick like like I say are you out here\nAnd what a talented guy he was innovative you know during those days\nWe didn't have a lot of computer animation and things like that everything he did was innovation and he was just he was funny because his experiments all sealed on television on purpose but everything he did failed and it was just hilarious\nUh yeah and it was ... in ... he would ... it was like watching the ... you know you would create the illusion so perfectly and then he would shatter it it's really amazing really amazing to see his stuff very funny\nSo who you hear you very clever he came into the studio and were live and he said that he has invented a new force field barrier that stops anything and he told me to take a swing at him and I said no I'm not going to do it and he said he said uh George George this works this works now\n... ... talk to you right here in the ... are you in the mouth and I did and I knocked us too so [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] oh my God everything he God he weighs let's go to the calls here one of the time\nWe go next to Tricia pie in California Tricia Seventy eight years old you go to movies still Trish\nOh I Love to go to the

he is went up to the table introduce themselves\nA and this was well Patrick who still finding his cancer sure and uh but asked him to come on the program and he was working on getting him as a guest on the show yeah and all of a sudden he died of pancreatic cancer oh what a nice guy he was\nAnd I loved him and goes to use your breathing in the music makes these films to\n[noise] uh yeah it's a great score can certainly make a difference I Know that that um you know before they added to the score to Star Wars they just thought it was going to be a dog but I think that John Williams scores just the perfect perfect touch you know it somehow elevate material\nYeah I think so too and Whoopi Goldberg was great and goes by the way\nWhoopi Goldberg was uh yeah that was a great role for her

projects for them or you know they don't know how to know how to use these people who were so incredibly talented I think that the rare occasion where they they found the perfect role for her\nTo go

begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across doing much do ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nThey are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nUh it's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of a day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or the Iowa ask for example or\nSomething that they use for big visions so if they want to anticipate what the whole groups should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participate\nThese experiences make you more aware of the possibility of God or does it take you the other way\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies\nOr suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to do a lot of different aspects of a really the supernatural image virtual reincarnation and things are done you've got some great stories about reincarnation of the books that you wrote back in two thousand Fifteen dumped makes was possible told me about that time with you how did you\nTo say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra for a film we made a feature\nLength documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of\nYou know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMadeline let's make a movie and I thought well I wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but much geared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that all of this cloning is happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri\nDish he's crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and preserve it on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Maryland who's hogwash life after death does not continue when we die each what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of and lightened meant um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at\nThe the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is in the ... the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I start using those guy yeah I Would say so\nAnd I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that went to his mom died he heard her voice and I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said what\nAnd that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting that God jak experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or has a now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually and frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio\nAnd his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more and his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they want it to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work in our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this\nStory reincarnation of on a little child was born with three birds march\nAnd we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch slips with us we're website is her name and we've done it linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy\n... ... email newsletters up six days a week and it's a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe'd be do program rejects the fascinating to the stream was upcoming info weekly free audio clip must have caused the pre sign up on the ... dot com ...

with Dr Merrill Lynch ... makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories that I'm\nJust want him to step birth march or something like\nRight well in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong in chest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a\nSo it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nExamples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person were shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological source of evidence for reincarnation and these young people\nYou know it's not absolutely evidence but\nAre evidence Shaw but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather\nAnd he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers and it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid's started remembering other things\nAbout the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got a bunch of pictures from\nThe dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snap shots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nBugs it's truly remarkable and remember the ... the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots\nAnd he knew things are both the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew them other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was ... and the and the doctor verified and they took him to a reunion oh a World War two veterans and he knew several of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the Jews\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um um this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greed\nAnd they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody develops this protocol where he put people in a darkened room put a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own\nAll where he put people in a darkened room put a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have and it has been shown to be extremely\nUseful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it they can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that\nIdea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles uh looking at a mirror and a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror image to do a lot of this\nIs right and that's really really strange uh-huh\nLarvae interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you were a mirror wondering would you get you in touch with her on her website is visionary living dot com you might be more straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now\nAnd you know we know that people uh believe different things even within a common culture a oh you have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of ration rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that is going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely our special guest Dr ... we're talking about the really things dealing with consciousness and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage Maryland\n[noise] I think it's a tricky question I'm Corinne ... [laughter]\nThat about you George ah I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while as long as you know if you're ... and ... of course right hell and damnation ... can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a\nGod per se but there's this idea of you know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God uh that's\nI'm a beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true tend to very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Yuma", "day": "05"}
