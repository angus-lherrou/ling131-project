in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seem because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what\nThey might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know\nThey're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that\nOur actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes they kiss goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams are giving us a luring pictures of possibility that we cannot none of us because we're not young enough but not rich enough will never find the right school or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream\nBecause we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggestion that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's for them to you can dream wide awake world around she will speak the language of signs and symbols than good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert\nTo the pop up to like pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream floating tonight as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream produce that might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the\nSame but just in not\nGetting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that dreams come about I mean dreams are not older people did one box\nWe do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe it very strange woman who sat down next to me in the play in an old reality and mentored me at a certain point that are dead house than to the period huh he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a\nDiner in Seattle on the news of the previous story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special\nEffects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dream\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hit an aspect of yourself\nThis is of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self maybe a site there why is there and fight the highest ...\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to is not hostile to you and it's probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective\nMaybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream shock us awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done complicates things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the current under staffed by kind of understanding I mean the really ready to revive quite ancient understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contains everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the personal doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information my getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dreaming basement juice at an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest even probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some grass nearby to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of store narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in\nScience and technology in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it\nIt can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand walked the job opportunities some living environment's a like\nA beyond death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function I'm dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dreams show us\nOpportunities and challenges that lie ahead their husbands the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did\nIt has that I have avoided death on the road tree dates with death fatal accidents by coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to\nFile on the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel all the time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact you understand what our relationship with the\nTime is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in all the time so together in those parallel times we're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and that that other parallel life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time will be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the life situations of people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nThat we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time and the previous seven point of view it's\nAll going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing what I Do not found myself connect

with us his latest book is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the twenty fifth publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\n[laughter] a short of that that's still pretty\nProlific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that can get a better job in the dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nDoes lifting some really interesting areas for example in terms of our hope\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of their body talk as well as so to speak and other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dream which shows the things that help us to get wild and to stay well that ended with acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were you know till after the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family well by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's the phenomena shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more of them look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal they're not supernatural but beyond the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition until after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen very biased\nIm about things like pre cognition until after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to be able to see things the distance Bible to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that fewer\nGrowing in developing these gifts to the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things dreams will deliver them if you can't find a solution to a problem or relied\nPut the question to your dreams and see what come and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so part of this part of part of the fence with all this is\nBut the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the the main thing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver that incident or citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go to the park or go and your morning commute\nWithout question in your mind and receive the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of deception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd ah what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I like this tape and I've got something for you to come on down it works doesn't it\nYes while you're send your ... your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental ... feedback in his day when people said telegrams he'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with\nAnd not mailing it he just right on a on\nThe edge that I'm that person unnoticed walk followed that he said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing a game that is an age all day and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached a menu of reaching a but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be able to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example\nOf sending a mental sending medical ... what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then just for some reason they pick it up yeah yeah ... we'll\nWe'll do a little experiments of my groups by which one of those degrees the bell said to him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was\nIt might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people a better send us another ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on in our dreams overtime\nRobert you've talked about synchronous and explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this make I dreaming once we understand the dreamy might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the ... to the old really understanding in our consensual hallucinations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including the departed and our ancestors\nThrough synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence is to live on the other side of those cooked in the walls of Audrey understanding come pushing up poking or tickling to bring us a way to give us a message of some kind\nOf this is the thing about ... that you gave us who are sitting currency 'cause it's set up without trouble in Tokyo about consultants they gave us a different word incident Christie we often feel there's a hidden happy if you are getting a wait and cannot handshake or pushback\nFrom something beyond our kitten something we cannot see so although the phenomena of this cold isn't\nA causal phenomena him and said then so there's no obvious pattern of cause and effect we often feel there is causation that play you might even feel that very large forces are play poses the forces that you're called the archetype so that people might have called the spirit of the guard so the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shaped every day of my life the paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like not just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a

how it works because we do agree that it does work what how\nWell it it the the laws attraction has been oversimplified mistakes that by the by the new age but the laws attraction it's always in play

drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think Gemini damn\nWell it's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest ... sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't bucked it's\nPerfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible that the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a Luttrell meaning but the symbolic meaning if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going\nAcross the corn ... seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of something that lies ahead to me in life which is good to have the emotional falls to the emotional pools\nOr something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me the pairing me forward emotional situation which are not all the situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want holding that image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone but I sort of want to reach into that dream and grabbed up so that led the cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this\nThis is the way that I Am about trees I probably would I rather liked the idea of the upside down cellphone\nYet scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years since the dream I sort of want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone or the ... to my ear and say who is there talk to me while you and see what I gather it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nYou know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones all receiving phone calls from them and sort of want to go that direction with that tree\nRobert wire dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream sauce or the dream sources of many sources of freedoms and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI signed the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ...\nTake a look at what is really going on when you do that you've pretty quickly\nYou can fill in some of the gets when you learn the technique could dream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing though something about living a whole life\nAnd play and politically in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd can live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes the tick tock time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our service members of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nWhat is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dancing yet to understand how to come loosened dream is the idea of listed dream it's become very popular since that movie inception and the idea is talented you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\n... the ... century but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it for themselves but many trying memorized ways of wake you up to ... inside of dream because your hands if you can stick a finger through your um that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to become looser treatments to start up loose and stay that way\nSo I don't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not\nScout ahead of us so some aspect of consciousness checks out what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and can use it\nSo regular dreams or what regular dreams of people I mean the dream span a whole spectrum they are big dreams are little dreams that little dreams that I'd rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message from those you might kill yourself in the presence\nOf the highest dose of wisdom oh you've gone travelling you know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so the point is that all of these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to remember more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic practice keep a journal writer don't give it a title natives your feelings around the experience to run a reality check asked\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do

when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in those ... mental a travel ban maybe even\nMentally time travel\nBut then tonight solver we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in prom night\nTo oh waking dream during the day a dream and watch reality is maybe plastic malleable um where we can't\nTravel mentally time travel but actually like the ... men and women around the world that cycling travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as a white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if you comment on that you seem to go out that I\nI Love your raping statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the freedom of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and malleable can we make allowance for we talked earlier about how your your your tensions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape your reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel or shape shifting et cetera is of course is is has beat on to debate among scholars and scientists and and there're traditions of it in different medical it needed just\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility\nEither for certain kinds of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from one time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes I don't know where the shape shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central\nIt's physically impossible for both people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which fascinates me to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nDivide step from what it is up from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in the body in the bed\nI get it out of bed I get off the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better and make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality that we sometimes falafel\nDreams is just so powerful Robert thing my gosh they're they are I'm dreaming of the\nWay that we wake up this is one of my ... when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when I had bumper stickers\nOn my car I made I made one\nThat said wake up and dream because for me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep dreams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know\nThat we can dream in other ways and wake up to the deeper reality and how the ways waking sometimes without dreams but like sleep workers doing with other people tell us to do trying to fit in with their expectations trying to to fit in with our schedules and forgetting that there was a logical step is to all of this\nWork are you weren't going to come

Robert\nThat [noise]\nThat one is called what the shift network tell me about that is it the ship network they have a lot of interesting programs where I've been doing a long long called quantum dreaming where we marry\nSome of the methods than ideas have shut many dreaming to the insides of quantum physics I did from time to time at different levels and we create an international community of active premiums who have wonderful than\nWhat has been for you the most\nOverwhelming aspect of dreams your dream interpretations for you\nI think the important important thing for me George is the stories that come from it I mean I'm a story when I meet a stranger on the plane ... what do I do I say I'm a storyteller and it gives me great pleasure to help other people find bigger and brave the stories they might he might have been living and to apply those stories and bring them into the world and\nDreams are a source of story this is a very ancient form the creation of dreams if get out the western desert in straight to\nA ... an aboriginal people who still of the old way like some of the cooking job will sit around a fire\nBoiling a belief of the tea and they'll they're sharing stories no TV that the stories of other entertainment and the first comment on a certain kind of Greene story might be\nA good story that an old story sweet tea\nI let let me just go a little bit so that would this I think sometimes in life we are trapped in the old tired personal histories we need a way of finding a way for would entering a larger more powerful story which can be a source of healing and courage and determination in life our dreams deliver\nStories so I think the me all of the time I've been dreaming I'm looking for the story power of previous stories I could write them could tell stories that helped to tell my life in a larger frame than the ... the little everyday mind\nMight appreciate and I really love it really gives me great pleasure to watch other people finding an harvesting the stories that have the giving them\nAnd then your work conversation with a Damon of Luna yes a lot of people a little scared about that what's what's going on\nWell they might be I mean uh it it it it might be scary to think that there are realms of spiritual beings beyond our human plane\nUh who are operating in territory that might initially you'd be a little daunting to humans\nIt's an ancient understanding the astro plane of the moon and I'm Talking about the physical moon known to the Astros realm of lunar\nIs a place of much traffic with solar spirits coming into the body in this world transit where so last third leaving the world after death might also spent some time but it's on the right track is going up with Rob Dunn what's in their beings off this plane\nSo I gave voice to being of the hospital realm of living that he's not to be cool to the money is not even\nHe's a day mountain that the ancient Greek to which is neither good no doubt in itself it means he's a spiritual being\nWho lives on a different plane of reality and we're hearing his voice\nWhat might be going on in your life on mine in terms of what happens people are and what happens off the debt which might be but there are a transition zones the veterans of course called bothers states\nWhich have a certain geography which is at least you can find out about the geography involving for example the ... realm of the mood so I gave voice to a very interesting culture should a creature of this of this realm and read it and judge yourself\nExcellent let's take the calls let us go to Joe in Long Island New York Hi Joe go ahead\nHi Rob at a couple of things are my first question what the uh\nAnd that seemed to have a scene with moving parts it's clear that this moving parts\nAnd I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio as are trying to find his way out of the ship that oil is moving parts and he still has that theme they still wants to stay with us all friends in the movie uh yeah you know he still has hopes about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now [laughter] I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed a\nCouple of times like block shots that word near the top of the black board so I had to be shopping high\nEnergy good jumping ... yeah [laughter]\nAnd this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know it's basically concern with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assessed\nSo I Can't having the stream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a dream to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or in rock at springing up another type of a singing you know\nVery interesting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I'm a former player I I'm not doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping higher I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jumped a jumped in life of a different kind where is the next ... I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity\nMight be a new form of understanding what am I going to be a slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy between my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps to jump the lies ahead the the the moving parts and the Titanic analogy is interesting is not a lot to go on but if I if the moving parts make me think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being hit by a stream to move on in some sense\nAnd I can't think about the Titanic without recalling the there was a great British research a psychic phenomena in the paranormal go W T stead you're the famous journalist ... day we went down on the Titanic Twenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable line I called the majestic NO NAME of the captain of the vote in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account of long range pre cognition as embodied the story Rob simply a dream report I must add that stood up to death dictated or centers dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of the cold the blue island so the Titanic association\nSaid also the pot moving in my mind that thank you for that\nYou know how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius you almost like a time travel or how would you do that in a dream state you think\nYou you feel that in relation to sit and kind of mind I mean she was often said that you can't explain Tesla the original Tesla except to the time traveler you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than the current reality they are in the sense able to reach two other mine\nAble to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than ... reality they are in the sense\nAble to reach two other mines the poet you ate the Irish poet we ate sue the theme of another of my stories of mysterious realities\nHe spoke about the mingling of mine said what he was saying is if you're a doctor in a certain costs a study or inquiry or creative breakthrough you will attract the intelligence the intelligence and the the the the the support\nQuestion why do you think people order a particular on trade when dining out\nTaste calories poor health\nNews talk five sixty ... where you muck comes to talk [noise]\nFrom what our air conditioning and heating studio this is talk five sixty K B L U Yuma\nMounting evidence FBI building probe I Know a a princess Trump cabinet member has backed out of a Saudi investment conference as the White House decides how to handle the investigation into the presumed murder of journalist ... inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey correspondent Melissa rainy has\nOf the growing evidence that she does that and after a meeting with Trump anthem pale treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced via Twitter that he's pulling out of the future investment initiatives done it\nBeneficial is expected to attend the summit and then you can play him\nAll the ministry should wait for the investigation slid\nUn officials are calling the disappearance of shooting a heinous attack against human dignity we're waiting\nFor the results of about three different investigations and be able to get to the bottom fairly says\nAnalyst rainy report or us maybe helicopters crashed on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan housing non fatal injuries to some say was on board spokesperson for the navy seven fleet says the M.

with it\nAnd be diligent and your request keep asking\nWe were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or other just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures he always had a camera or two on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of spare photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of where things going on and it's so interesting George maybe you can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference do you think\nThere is a huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up ... or ... just about everything that you can't see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to just see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would with a present at the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photography scientific photography has the ability to not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far\nIt's really not good\n[laughter] how do you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train the deceased person somebody cared about\nA great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for a few tests the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say that's what I Would recommend\nIt just er he received anything at all you always have to have a blessing for our skin tests disappear as you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier\nAnd if you're religious you could say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because of books fell off the shelf by themselves and unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board you\nKnow and I know your feelings about the wage abroad and I agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps that having book about my ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young teens ah\nAnd my brother that we're using a weed you brought in my living room and I was sitting on the couch watching them and we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside a demon face\nOh really that's in my book seven steps\nSo it's going to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety seven bridge got a birthday coming up like Greg\n... Hey Greg wanted to test your ability because over the past few decades has met with psychics and maybe a handful of actually came up with predictions by saying like a you know what what's the Toyota Corolla doing around [laughter] that's how I got there and all this but\nThe others has worked off of the strategy saying oh you should be speaker and this and that so that's\nHow I should be anything but I'm telling you to death I Will say one thing about you [noise]\nUh you have at the time if you look at Mars a sign a Scorpio so you love secrets and you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and\nYou know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and true so great to somebody I can do for you\nYeah I'm Wondering if you see predicting wise or something coming up for me career or my income was a change or to make it better [laughter]\nWell you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines like detective work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh game shows where you've got to get the words\n[laughter] oh that's a good start well are you starting a new career\nI'm not really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance ah independent contract work with a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you is if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that\nIt's discovering mysteries you should really followed along those lines out just kind of a study forensics for bed\nAnd when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain that is really exciting if you're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you for saying that Greg\nCooper everything works out for you speaking of honesty joins UC something bad will you tell that person\nYou have to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like an accident in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid\nI had a very very very bad accident or a few years ago because I did not listen my guy told me not to go out the twenty four hours\nA home but someone came on you're sitting down that we have to go to the beach we have to do this and I had a who really horrendous accident so guides who will tell you and if you're not told and you have the accident

that because there's always exactly what you said oh you don't always have to have a death but usually a car it's like one leaves and one comes in and you know what it doesn't have to be the same

ourselves the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's a good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us\nWe don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams you know sometimes this is\nVery interesting sometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a luring pictures of possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right girl of the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream\nBecause we don't think that we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the simple suggestion that I often that you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake world around you will speak the language of science and symbols and things but as you could pay attention and sometimes you get more alert\nTo those pop up so the pop ups in waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nThe same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same dream of very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how\nI Dreamed producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same\nBut just not\nGetting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that dreams come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box\nWe do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there is a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane an old reality and mentored me at a certain point that the debt husband or the kid that he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the news creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people or that they'll see in their dreams that I'm doing the music\nAnd the special effects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe of your highest self maybe a site the wiser and fight the highest though\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a slight why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are poorer for Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding by kinda understanding I mean the really really the revival is quite interesting understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contains everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have personal doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about\nYou can do dream in ... when you set an intention to get guidance on any theme that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point you're ready to list the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they come through across history a lot of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of Stuart narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything and the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology\nIn the aughts even in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the ... hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it\nIt can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand walked the job opportunities some living environment a like\nA bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious of dreaming\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is and this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dreams show was\nOpportunities and challenges that lie ahead their husbands the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they can say that marriage

we step out of the NEA time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your

gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and that that other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting

things going on in dreams of that that body chalk as well as soul tool in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this was front and center the idea is that a dream my gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay

sharing adventures\nFriends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's being cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal they're not supernatural but that'd be on the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to able to see things the distance Bible to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active dreamed that you'll find that you are\nGrowing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things greens will deliver them if you can't find a solution to a problem or relied\nPut the question to your dreams and see what comes and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence of old is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to you like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought or preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver an incident or citing that gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street are going to the talk of going your morning commute\nWithout question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd do what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape and heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I

benign example of sending a mental sending ... is what Mark Twain photos\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you for some reason they pick it up\nYeah yeah just we'll we'll\nDo a little experiments in my groups by which one of

synchronous and explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this when you make a dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook will develop or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deep space we have the counters with people who live in a deeper space including that of powder than our
