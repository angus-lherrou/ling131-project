I think you're defeat in your cause 'cause I think we should all be one and we are one and and I don't think anyone should be discriminated against\nWhat'd you shouldn't hold yourself out as different either and said my people would be my my opinion on it um but no one should have any racial injustice and we shouldn't hold somebody you know the prejudice something drives me crazy there's there's no reason for it except\nLack of understanding ignorance whatever I'm also another football news Green Bay\nKicker the heat with what a great big kicker makes the news it could be very good or very bad because usually we never talk about kicker\nPickers aren't hitting the headlines I mean who cares as a kicker and it unless he wins the game will end his front page kicker pulls out or whatever the kicker mystified feel go five attempts\nOn Sunday that's a lot has a lot and they laws they had they won maybe maybe it would be a little bit more of a forgiving but a Mason Crosby he missed five kicks forty one yard or forty two thirty eight fifty six\nAnd a\nThey lost thirty one twenty three you\nDid get one in ... he made one [noise] [laughter] with a few seconds left to play they paid what a poor guy gotta feel sorry for him you know it's a mental thing for the kicker is more so than anyone else or Rogers the quarterback which is a real leader went over to console him afterwards\nYeah that some of the things down there are but [noise]\nAnd thereby last year's number two thousand Seventeen we had twelve thousand eight hundred and forty seven you know from a hundred and thirty eight thousand\nTwo amazing and during that same time there were two thousand seven hundred and six vehicle incursions last year we had in this will let you know what can be done to the border\nAnd and then it can be controlled were proof of it that gets ignored by those who would think that it can be done it's like a phone call you on the air\nAnd good morning rod hey good morning they uh well uh you would want to hear me call in or or a week or so I I'm I'm having a vacation here in the morning so it will be a good John\nOkay I certainly will um ah I get to go up north pole and and the and a wonderful what they're having up there will be a good\n... but anyway yeah I I was just you know when you ... you know I'm really on top of things around\n[laughter] we at least you needed a way that's good\nYeah yeah eventually and uh and I know that there's a gap in a school is a good thing and I did wrong again\nA ban that and that's cool well\nAt the and that's ... that's being a I don't know whoever the school district was there for a quarter of million dollars right now today and uh I you know I don't care what people spend their money on\nBut with all the criticism and complain about a\nFoot off to school and a and everything going on in the middle of climate there truly you know as far as uh\nYou know that you've got the money to send it the wrong way solved never be able to get to write but uh but uh but on the other hand they're playing because how much the rules are we why are you a\n... I don't know if not fixing a lot of staff\nWho can't can't can't buy pencils and paper but we can some room I understand what you're saying\nNow Miami and I'll find out more about it but my understanding was handed to fund raisers to pay for those kids\nBut well that was true but still hold are coming up with funny though and all that spending money on but if they're learning about\nHow much will cause right they doing that or for fitting or money or get exposed to all weekend oh\nThey're tightening ten years you know if that's what I find that I don't understand\nWell it's a ... yeah it's a personal choice in the family says that they want their kid to go to Rome to pick up a brand to do it than they do it\nUm but\nI don't know uh but I don't want to hear him complain about how much food cost down\nWell yeah these republics will introduce they're not connected to completely in the school system's not beans with a room trip itself to the individuals but\nUm at least to my knowledge right\nBut you were saying that the individuals and local people and businesses will donate to help some kids get their the room which I think\nUh but you're saying that the vigils and local people that and businesses will donate to help some kids get there to Rome which I think is a good a good deal and and good charity you know to help a kid gets Roman changes life probably for a teenager to get to Rome you and I are too old for not going to be changed\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo many kids somebody's kids it may be a a a trip that inspires them in some ways with all kinds of excites me to see a young young person achieve something so great that they get invited and their dad expert at the music they get invited and then they get to see the world\nOr for some reason you know for for a short time I can probably affect their whole life or their whole direction\nIn the navy if they want\nIt hey I'm an advocate for that too buddy absolutely I think that's a wonderful decision but I appreciate your call and you have a great time in Spokane\nOkay right on your mark how are\nTalking about and get him back to the border patrol just to show you how drastic it's fallen in United in in the human sector from a hundred and thirty eight thousand twelve thousand people in two thousand seven hundred vehicles to just ten vehicles\nOr because of the border wall the border barriers you know you you got you got a fencing in post and and sometimes just terrain and and all kinds of things to do it here in Yuma and and that's before the wall even more down to those numbers I'm sure the wall would even prove things but\nAccording to the article the biggest factor\nWas a hundred and sixty percent increase in staffing uh from three thirty one to eight fifty nine so are you put up all those barriers now the ... the staffing didn't help the the vehicles leaving vehicles came staffing or not vehicles can't come now just 'cause there's no way to get through it you're not going to drive anymore\nOr what happened to all those people you know the additional people up to eight hundred and fifty nine plus the technology the border fence is the infrastructure\nOf this year those been a little different\nThere's been twenty six thousand this year given mine that was only twelve thousand last year up twenty six thousand this year so way under the numbers of years passed but I'm Ninety percent from South America turned themselves in\nAnd of course are you a sector has to take care of the book Barry Goldwater range which is a\nIs important because there have been times many times where in the past\nWere incursions cause the military to shut down exercise they may have dozens of ... aircraft in the air ready to uh you know do some exercises and they have to send them all home I don't know if you know what that costs but that's not cheap\nA hundred and twenty six miles in Yuma sector and a sixty three miles of fencing\nAnd then other vehicle barriers and all that kind of stuff but it wasn't real success in Yuma a tremendous success in Yuma or that doesn't get highlighted enough I don't think of something they did recently was holed up they held the uh open house or some kind of media academy\nI I didn't know about it now chances are I got the email chances are I'd got notification\nI I I missed it somehow I because I certainly would like to have seen some of the new technologies some of the new operations and what they're doing with the canine units\nAnd they did all that so I missed it so thank you to the to the sun for put it in there and that was a James Gilbert not to call James and say hey change with they don't miss that by the way\nOr maybe it wasn't a maybe came at times but I don't even remember reading it and I do get emails from the border patrol I don't pay as much tension as I used to mean occasionally I'll I'll read some of them\nThe drug apprehensions and and where they're happening in those kinds of things but the border patrol\nA tremendous tremendous job they've done it human makes me ignore them because look there's just not enough to talk about with the border patrol they do a great job it's invisible almost\nUm that they keep a secure we we've grown used to it since two thousand five that we'd not over run we see them constantly at the checkpoint particularly on highway eight and they always is just always respectful and nice so or nothing but kudos to border patrol let's take a phone call you on the air\n[noise] uh yesterday I just wanted to ask you\nAbout that\nThat that you mentioned it right now you said that uh one of the factors a or a man was a border patrol getting more staff\nSure\nYeah there was an all looking for Spanish well when it was up a hundred and sixty percent of it went from three hundred and thirty one in two thousand four to eight fifty nine today or two thousand Seventy\nOkay so it was an extra five hundred people\nYeah you know and the reason why I Would like to make sure because you know a place where I work I'm actually not really relevant but it it\nYou know they keep asking us to you know perform or um and now now we you know we have left and right\nWe eat are trying to bring up that part of the art of the problem is like not being staff right now and are being short and and all the time right you know they found out that the ocean is just a few more you\nKnow what I mean older smart but make sure you know that that is what you said well\nThat way I guess maybe I can bring that up you know what you got all that happened in it because of this\nShow now well take a take 'em a copy of the newspaper today it's Monday's paper October eighth and it's the front page and it gives all the details of what they're doing\n[noise] oh okay All right All

back seat or whatever cashed out right where she got the idea that the this attack happened at that time\nBy she doesn't remember much but I'm very vividly on the beer and on him but that just doesn't make sense\nAt all in it and it didn't make sense to most people that we're looking at it objectively and I and I will I Will tell you from everything I've seen that I don't think this was anything to do with objectivity I think it was that a lot to do with just\nPolitics and it's unfortunate because we deserve better\nAnd it makes you wonder if these are Democrats who are on the handle let her a question for it must feel awful comfortable\nYou know areas they're running that none of those Democrats\nAnd and there was evidence physical evidence and and opportunity and it was recent like yesterday and nobody believed Bill Clinton's accusers now they want to believe every accuser and it's just a talker seat I think resonates with people\nYeah but they must feel awful stronger or of not being challenged you're not losing their physician or for the next reelection that they would have\nGone out with that well I even left with a lot of egg on their face\nI think the the Democrats support them or supporting the outrageous miss that they're they're performing\nNow the ones that might be in trouble are the ones that are in the states that were window very much for Trump and we'll we'll wait and see how that happens but I think that those states or when they showed her hand that clearly on who they really are and those are states that voted for Trump I think they may have some real problems\nYeah All right certainly usually a great new whether thank you sir you take care of\nAnd I'm going to joy that knew whether to the weather is turned I like it and get him back to these accuser Jewish sweating like the one that you know ... you know gang rape and and she attended ten of these gang rape sessions she kept going back for some reason and then she saw George Collins judge\nI'm Mike was it might judge and a\nAnd Brian at the same place\nAs well then she retracted it I mean she she changed the story a little bit contradicted it and uh she's got some comments now that it's all over now so yeah after the phone call you're on the air\n... to finish this I just started at a we're talking about the call in or out great for everybody is for what she did let's give a little credit that Joe mansion too I Know has had on the chopping\nBoss personally and reelected ... is the only Democrat that came over to the side and he's done that stuff before you know which is good maybe to dump out of the party and become a Republican and he\nHe has done it before but uh yeah he did in these you know politically he's in squeeze we'll see how that guy and\nI Believe that judge Kavanaugh as far as his\nUm career goes and has been I think it's it's a\nIt's an awesome career I mean I think he's been a very fair map I Am\nA little concerned in that\nThink that you know the accusations that were made that for a family house was\nFor a close and the judge Kavanaugh's mother was the one that you know she just the judge did or job I mean that's all she was doing I I think that she may have had other opportunities\nThroughout judge Kavanaugh's career probably to have thrown a tail spin on it I don't know why she would have used that if that would be a a just a you know a thought\nFor doing it so no\nI Am concerned do though in in judge Kavanaugh's uh going down the political line of I Know he was mad I Know it was agitated for being accused of something that you know until that man has been proven guilty he is innocent and I totally believe in that\n[noise] but I just concerned now down the road is is hopefully he doesn't have that revenge full tactic against a party line decision and hopefully he can continue\nHe wouldn't be it'd be the good judge has been up until now he wouldn't be not saying they\nWouldn't be a good judge if he did and uh you know there would be but they're always ...\nThere are certain things in your life that could make you turn one way or the other I mean it it\nGot put through the ringer and just like anybody could it forward would have a good reason to to come back and make these accusations I mean it could also be on the on the on the street could also fit the other foot\nTall I just hope that that that that never come into play\nI Do believe as a man and judge she is uh he's done a great job I\nMean I I've actually so you're up you're okay with the way things worked out\n\nI Wish I mean I Know that you know innocent till proven guilty and I wish to to really have had a clean slate but unfortunately maybe no matter what they would have done it probably never would have worked out that way uh I think more time should have been given in to say look you know what\nCome on you know what other crap you have brought on a plate right now and forever hold your piece\nAt the FBI investigated it comes back it comes back this man has been vetted I don't know how many times\nWe've got ... we you know as you say you're a Democrat we've on local political leaders that are Democrats political Democrats from the ... county that completely disagree local\nLeaders their elected officials and yet sometimes elected them I think they're ...\nThey're both when you're when you're an elected official you become a political leader to the president of the United states becomes the political leader for the Republican Party that's the way it works so political leaders or or social\nGo ahead you know certainly Fernandez she's she's yeah she's hostile throwing barbs with people because of chemical hostile so obviously she doesn't believe in in the same things you believe in but\nYou know what then as soon as they do ... I think about this too\nHospital so obviously she doesn't believe in in the same things you believe in but you know what then as soon as they do\nIt I think about this too because you were a political leader at one time or is okay so you're you're privy to\nA lot more information than than your then your Republican or or your party neighbor down the road it just goes in votes every year or whatever for famous you the best thing okay so you're privy to a lot more information right of course\nOkay do you think maybe she's probably to a lot more information as well\nShe's probably do a lot of information not not not Colorado specifically about political leadership within the state of Arizona sure\nBut I don't think she was I don't think so much as she was against Kavanaugh as much as from what I read from our listeners from what you said I think she was more frustrated or the people that were supporting him and what and what resources they were using in a way that were coming from that she may have been privy to\nThat she does that mean that she just because you're against the way to just because you're against the way or you're not happy with the way that he played out new immunity\nAnd you're not just that just makes us an agreement because she's against ... Doug do she she said helped\nGet Kavanaugh through which I don't know how the heck is he couldn't vote but with attacking do do see because Kevin have gone through means that she didn't want the government to get through\nIt and attacking part of part of being in a political party one way or the other I mean look at look at these people to know or know that are running for officers that have never ran for office but the commercials are saying that this person is going to do that how do you know what this person is going to do that ran\nFor office talking is not a way to to do and it's attacking is is uh chewing on the way it should be done but it's a choice has been\nListening to the commercials are you playing a radio station yes I mean nobody not attacking a buddy\nOf course it happens it's a choice though it's not it's not what you have to do you don't know if you ...\nYou can choose to take the high road you really can but I think when you're in ingrained in the political arena and you're prejudiced so much information I think after a while it just gets frustrating unfortunately maybe sometimes they're wrong words come up our president does it on a daily basis that you're not\nThe president does a lot of you know a lot of it you have no problem with a choice the\nLast thing you think it's great yes on some cases sometimes like grits okay\nSo maybe the shoe fits on both\nOn both on both sides oh I I'm I mentioned the Grinch as to\nYou know I I listen I\nIt it's in various things some days to have to to the leaders that we have literally just our president but in different an all or in some days it's very embarrassing\nDonald Donald Trump will take a shot someone takes a shot at him there was no question he does not just the but there was a call ... he has a sugar daddy name did well where does that come from what we talking about sugar daddy what what have you guys is that acceptable to no end\nIn about all the FBI directors here a while back about how they had literally sugar daddy\nWhat's okay for for her to come out early and say uh the sugar daddy which we don't gives an indication of something other than just money\nI've learned a long time ago not to judge I'm not going to say it's okay or not okay I'm I'm telling you that she's probably to more information and\nThat so in that area up in up in our state level that we don't know just like I'm sure there was some other stuff that went on that you saw that we didn't know and\nNow that you chose not to let it out or comment on it one thing\nI don't know that I've ever held held anything back at all I mean I I read ... there's no information I have that's a secret other than executive sessions and things like that but uh anything about it\nBut you but you're privy to some stuff that happened that probably really wouldn't be you know you don't go out and advertise it or what have you not but you probably oh\nStrategy going on with race or something no strategy knows but information is\nPretty much a minor league everything because it's not it's not it's everyone should know but I appreciate the call I got to run I go to Brazil used ended up being a Democrat\nOn the ... you don't have to appreciate it\nBut no but I appreciate the call I got to run I got ...

I'm Still here I think for a waiting so patiently during the break\nRoom I had a question of of clarification or you can see that you were standing containers now you're referring to the cremated ashes of a loved one left and then er or possibly to shrink wrapped plastic bag\nYeah and I'm just one that I'm Talking about what they were in earns but I'm not that familiar with all the possible uh\nContainers that there can be and so sometimes we'll come across these containers and not know what they are off the bat you know and in one particular case they were really small metal like\nThey fit in my hand and uh they were heavy metal they looked like fingernails on the end of a curtain rod almost\nLike that decorative kind of thing and for the longest time we were thinking what is this you know and there are a couple of them and uh finally a what we got some council from a a a funeral home director and he said well those are that's a\nThat's a container that whole dashes and we're like oh okay now we know how to progress with the ... and we talk to the family and were able to ship those off to them once we knew what they were\nBut ah yeah ... and there are some times where for example the families out of town and um they just can't get here or they don't even want to come here I've had a couple of where they they said I'm never going to go to humor I don't want to fly there I don't want to drive there I don't want to go um can you take care of the cremation and then picking up the ashes\nAnd so will hold those uh you know in our custody until we can get them shipped out or until the family comes and picks them up or whatever we have a range does that answer your question\nYeah it's just that I guess between a word you were using and just seeing too many horror film so my path it might you know I got a picture of a\nDead body [laughter] five gallon [laughter] buried in the backyard I'm like why\nYeah no no I haven't done that one yet but I wouldn't put a path to put them passive but thanks for calling in yeah man we're going with the Halloween themed today on Sonia yeah I Know ... the remains that I'm Talking about art or the cremated ashes of of ah the family members or the loved ones so um you can put those in all sorts of different things sometimes they're in a\nIn a bag a plastic bag but then those are typically once they're released if if the family doesn't you know buy something to put them in then the ... the default is they're put in a bag of really secure bag and put in a plastic container that keeps them all contained\nUm there was one in our fault a couple of weeks ago where I had to move it to get some to something and I could have sworn there is like the debris on it and so I wouldn't wash my hands after\nThat because I wasn't quite sure I'm sure it wasn't but it just makes you feel better it just makes me feel better you know put a little hand sanitizer yeah and then I rub my hands no I I doubt it was anything it's just when you're starting to touch these things and move them around and I just get really it gives me that he would you be so um\nThe whole point of this this discussion is don't end up on an attorney shelf or in their involved that's the whole point of this so how do you avoid that that's my question how do you avoid um ending up on the shelf\nOf someone you know that you don't even know are in an\nAttorney's office or or somebody else's office ... how do you avoid that well the answer that question is you put planning and placed ahead of time so that your loved ones know exactly what you want it and what to do with your means I have this conversation every day with the clients that come see me and as I go through this methodical\nUm this methodical question and answer a discussion with my ...\nIt's like go through this methodical um\nThis methodical question and answer a discussion with my clients I Will get down to the nitty gritty and I will ask them okay do you want to be buried or do you want to be cremated there are some times when people say well we haven't really made up our mind okay what are you feeling right now\nAnd then we'll put that down and say okay well there's a I'm going to print this out for you and the printout are notes and you think about this and then you let me know if it's different\nSo you don't have to make a decision right then and there but usually people will go with what they first\nPut down just because that's how they feel um\nSo I Will ask how do you want to how do you want to be or how do you want your remains to be dealt with cremation burials um if it's cremation or even if it's burial um but if it's cremation I say okay then what what happens with those ashes who do you trust to go pick them up number one because that makes a difference legally\nI'm there are some cases where in Arizona if you're cremated\nA funeral home or the cremation a facility will not released her ashes to just anybody you can't just walk in and say hey that's my uncle Bert can I pick up as a ashes they're not going to do that they have to get consent from all the legal Aires first before they can release the ashes to\nSomebody that's not a legal there and so they have to get these waivers because they don't want to be legally liable for releasing ashes to individuals that weren't authorized to receive them\nUnless unless you do planning ahead of time and you say well actually I Know that's the law of Arizona but I trust the following and you can name people that you trust\n'em and you can be kind of general about that some people put my my then serving trustee or my power of attorney agent under under my health care directive some people say I want John Doe to do it so you get to supersede the state law but a lot of people don't know this they don't know that oh actually\nOnly your closest can are the ones that have the authority to waive\nTheir rights to pick up the ashes and so sometimes I've had calls to my office where grandma's been sitting\nIn the mortuary for a month to month and a half because the kids are not cooperating or they're not signing these waivers and the\nI I don't do it on the Oh yes [laughter] I don't do the video though yeah yeah yeah well you\nCan do it I'll pay you five dollars I don't know video I Do the audio for you okay well ah we were talking about don't end up\nDon't end up with your remains in a an attorney's office and the way that we got to that discussion is because I currently have remains in my office in my fault of individuals that we need to deal with and get them to the proper location and to do that we have to determine\nWhat that location is working with the family members and putting key clues together and trying to determine what's best for the the ending resting place for these individuals that are in these um earns or packages whatever their ashes might be and\nSo my my whole point to this story today was don't end up like that and and you can't avoid it if you just put some planning in place so when I Do a plan for an individual or a family I I like to call the comprehensive estate plan because it includes\nThat type of information that will be relevant for the family members when you pass away as to how to treat and and what to do where to finally locate your remains and there are those times when people will say Adam I don't care they can do what they want with me flush me down the toilet throw me out in the desert I don't care\nBut I still put that in the planning so the kids don't always have this enigma in their minds are the family members don't have some sort of question as to what did he really want 'em if that's what you really wanted that you didn't really care and it was up to them then we'll put that in the planning because\nThey will be they will have greater peace of mind knowing okay he doesn't care so we can do it we feel is right\nOr she doesn't care so we can do we feel is right and that's that's such a load off of the family and a half off of the loved ones there are those times when people say well I Do want to be buried in rows Cranston San Diego where I Want to be put in the national a military cemetery in in uh Prescott so people sometimes we'll have\nA place that they want to be put and and then the next question is well do you have something in place already many do you have a prepaid funeral plan to take care of that or you are you hoping that the er the family members come up with the cash for the money to pay for that\nYeah what happens when you know you want something but you don't leave the funding to provide for it ... you know a Hunter S Thompson was was shot off into space Johnny Depp paid for that one that was five million dollars to what happens\nWhen there's something in between the two [laughter] do the best use of land with what you got but\nThe whole point of the planning so the planning is about the financial peace and then you've got the health piece\nAnd I would categorize these decisions as to where to put your body or where to what to do with your body cremate Barry creamy and Barry and then where's it going to finally be located if you if you want it to be put somewhere\nOr usually will connect those pieces and so we'll go through the exercise of either allocating life insurance funds for that\nWant it to be put somewhere or usually will connect those pieces and so we'll go through the exercise of either allocating life insurance funds for that or sometimes where people will put in place a life insurance policy is really kind of small you know in in the grand scheme of things compared to the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar life insurance policy that you could probably take out\nUm you would take out one for five thousand dollars or six thousand dollars that's specifically designed for after after death and paying for funeral costs paying for cremation kind of things um the challenge with that though is getting those funds released\nTo pay for that stuff in a timely fashion when you and I die on average here in ... county takes about two weeks before you get the death certificate that's actually issued that's if they know the cause of death but they don't know the cause of death now we're talking about an autopsy that could delay the the issuance of a death certificate for a month two months\nAnd really in the legal world that death certificate is your golden ticket without it there is no evidence that you died\nAnd so institutions are not going to recognize the death of an individual without a certified death certificate from a government issuing agency which would be the county health department and so\nYes in theory you can take out a life insurance policy for five six thousand dollars let's say to pay for your funeral or the cremation and then and then getting remains where you want it to go but in reality once you die\nThe family members aren't going to be able to cash that life insurance policy in without your death certificate which is going to take a couple of weeks in the best case scenario and worst case scenario is going to take a few months and so you don't really have direct access to that life insurance policy money that you anticipated\nTo pay for the funeral and the cremation so what most people will do is they'll run run it on their credit card they'll put on a credit card and hope that they can get those proceeds as soon as possible so they don't\nHave interest occurring on that charge on their credit card\nYou Adam if I pass away and the family is fighting mom but let's say the insurance for that funeral comes through you know five grand whatever actually funerals from expensive and I so five or ten thousand pay for the funeral um can that happen if the family is not in agreement about the rest of the state\n... it can happen because well through my planning it can happen because you you pick a decision maker or a couple of decision makers and so you have allocate illegally or you've already in ahead of time you've said okay\nI Want my oldest son and my youngest daughter they are my agents for me when I pass away to do this stuff and get it done\nSo regardless of whether the family is fighting you've already you've already a legally distinguished that these are the two that have legal authority to to take care of what I Want them to take care of so it doesn't matter what the other family members say\nThey'll probably take that into consideration but at the ... in the end of the at the end of the day those are your name and your planning have the legal authority to accomplish what you wanted to accomplish and and uh we're running up against another break that was a quick when are we are going to
