the call we got that early ah thanks so my\nYeah yeah definitely yeah I Want it I'm not really familiar with it yeah but I mean\nObviously it's a pretty good you know that that's\nA ... or ... anytime you say we don't want a tax don't tax don't tax don't tax it always sounds great and I'm I I Would support the don't tax message but what one twenty six is about picking winners and losers\nOne twenty six says you can pack you can't tax services forever and put it in the constitution which takes away our ability of flexibility for our state um legislators to you too would adjust taxes necessary well I don't want to I don't want to handcuff our state legislatures we don't know what ten years ago to bring a fine\nBut what that does by putting it by putting it in into the constitution means you you can't do it even if you wanted to and that would include all services like a you know hairdressers now there is NO PLAN to tax them right now anyway there is NO PLAN then there's a new to stop it will no one's done no one's attempting it\nThis is to lock it into it never happens to real estate agent seasonal that\nWhich when you start picking businesses for winners and losers and say okay we're going to go after the retail business but we're not going to go after service business well that's inherently unfair to pick winners and losers\nI mean I don't want any taxes but I Want taxes to be fair when we have to do them\nAnd that's that's a adjusted occasionally by legislators\nAnd um\nI think a big lobby groups from some of these industries have gotten together for this and that's where the funding comes from for the signs and for the advertising and once they convinced the Arizona voter than vote for it then forever it's in the constitution and and they can they crashed easy so it's a big investment on their part now\nUh for the future so that they get a preferential treatment\nAll right well I\nI don't really have\nThe right and we do have a ... minute\nVideo you know while we're driving and I think you put it out\n[noise]\n[noise] well I don't\n[noise] [noise] oh I don't want to vote [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] yeah\nI think you know what I\nSaw that coming up oh well I Know what I thought\nWell you're quite welcome and thank you for the call you asked a question probably other people are thinking that um you know I don't think keep reiterating so appreciated do and don't as they ask questions I mean heck even though she gives me homework\nSo I'll do it [laughter] things but they all remember\nBy you know that um\nI've been surprised one twenty six so much money has been going into that you wonder where the money's coming from a Muslim from the industry you know real estate agents and stuff that currently are not tax there's NO PLAN to tax them or what they want to put it in the constitution and anti everyone's hands over for now and forever and then what happens\nLet's say the taxes need to be collected they'll just keep him in the same old people you know those and in the same old people because that's all they can do and then just ... you know just retail business would get taxes no one else\nWill ... will civil\nReport for five to five eight I was talking about stock markets coming up this morning\nWe're one Seventy five that's a lot of this morning's less is less than one percent came on and so many points ... 'cause we're up so high up but it looks like Canada and us confirmed new deal with Mexico updating NAFTA this morning\nNow we meet a lot of news about Trump and Donald Trump in the Trump Administration and what the policies are and ... and never does the door never rarely does the\nMainstream media ever talk about anything positive that's happening this is remarkable what he's done remarkable that he's got done in the first two years\nAh but they would Canada made a deal yesterday you know and and to do kept saying he's not going to do a knock on wood against what he did not tell you what it is after the phone call you're on the air\nOr Rastogi or good morning sir I'm\nSo happy that you mentioned that referendum to your audience any time you see a referendum\nOn your about it that interferes with your state constitution voted against it yeah hello because like rush set like that but once they get it in there it's not picking winners and losers you already have this\nCalled your state representative and your state senators if you want to tax you vote for the right guy and it gave me the tax it and I said that\nCorrectly yes if you if you want to attack then you vote for the tax code for the guy that's going to bring it to you you already got it you don't need the referendum Sam I Am I right rush\nYou you're absolutely right in and it does is limits limits our elected officials things they can again do because it's in the constitution we want unintended consequences what happens oh gee and you know that\nI laughed at me tell you what they do that to arrange for the fourteenth amendment\nWhich the church of an outsider wrote in his book called the history of the English speaking people ... that was published right back in Nineteen fifty six [noise] and you wrote an over ... over for dinner and here's what he said it's one of the most pro yet articulation of the words in English language\nMe what it does not say\n[laughter] right\nWhere's it that's why he said I'll Try that again that is a great one of the greatest articulation English words to me what it does not say no\nAnd that's what the Fort Kate and then the dash memory chip wrapping section one\nWhen they read book first up to ... in the ... to ... part of your constitution should just say hell no that's that's the major problem we got oh by the way whatever they call

worst in Illinois\nHere lately and she attended a fundraiser there's get bit by a guy by the name of Jim Cooper now Jeff Cooper has called Trump supporters traders\nLike yours and some members of the geo pay KKK members dish it is the one that he attended is is your Santa bug out that's lying to you about who she is\nYeah yeah and that's exactly right it is now now you know she's she's a wolf in sheep's clothing trying to hide it but then she goes right to the fund raiser for the most radical left there's there are and then she goes back here and says she's independent conservative it's just

rally it it got ... ... is what they can stop calling them Trump rallies what they are they're they're they're stayed the union address is what he does but not for me\nRight at the union with that I think that's fair\nAsked two questions\nI thought it was the question what yeah what was I thought it was one but what were the two questions\nAnd well the first question was any part of that statement you made while you're wasn't on narrow it's any part of that fault\nHer answer was no the second question was did you leave out anything in your statement harassed or it was no that was the only two questions she was asked on a polygraph a polygraph before yeah a\nAn autograph I was involved in took over an hour and ... with the machine was hooked up all the time machine was look up to ... to question she's not talking about a liar and\nI don't understand how come are people that are running that are not smart enough to look into it and bring out the right questions because she's a lot and and she already live it's proven she lied and they're not going to prosecute a brand new that they're just kind of let her go like are buying less Republican\nIt will do that they will not stand up for the party that will stand up for the country great they just let it go and they want to look like good guys and don't want anybody to beat butter and it kinda\nWell then we need to we need to rally and vote to make sure we get Republicans in there and that's that's our answers that the voting bucks and that's what we do appreciate the call\nThing and I saw that FBI agent interviewed they did an interview him and he said it was a single issue well maybe two questions over the single issue and it was just about the written statement I don't even know what a written

time oh man\nI\nI just I just I don't know just shocked and I guess like why why are we pausing what's what's what are we can learn and I and I guess it was ... left appease the liberals at the same time you know the the one that's been really strong and it's been a\nUm\nGraham Lindsey Graham who will start for your phone so so we've got this are you\nHearing going up you know now we're going to have this hearing that uh\nI mean the hearing the investigation by the FBI you in an old ready you've you've got ... and others who you made its Mazie Hirono from the Hawaii the senator already downed plane to me they move and then there's this little uh\nThing put together and the one of the articles I read said the gyms talked to for deserves a hearing Republicans let's have a hearing the Democrats bullies this hearing as a sham when I was hearing and says the Democrats ... we needed FBI investigation Republicans say okay we'll have an FBI investigation Democrats investigation as a force and that's that's absolutely\nThe verbiage and everything else that certain Democrats roll using\nIs with the FBI investigation is already a farce\nAnd they and they got exactly what they asked for which seemed to me that was a forest to have one\nDoesn't mean anything\nBecause we already had an investigation investigation was open to the public in front of the hearing so we've had the hearings with the Democrats wanted they say it's a sham we were having to be an investigation of Democrats wanted and it's a farce\nAnd we haven't even had a yeah they've already they've already announced it while it's going on and why they're interviewing people that it's already a farce and she was crazy I'm German of the committee juice Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley\nHe wrote I cannot overstate how disappointed I Am in the California Democrats refusal to share Ford's allegation against Feinstein St her decision and ultimately compromise forged anonymity and unfairly stole Kavanaugh's confirmation by politicizing the sexual snorkeling and that's just it\nIt's about delaying the lay delay delay that's the goal is delay\n'cause they can't when\nThey can only they can win if they believe that's it that's their only when it's like a phone call you on the air\nHigh um two things one uh Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor put out a five page report right\nThen uh I think a two page timeline and it would be really good for people to get a hold of it I got it off of Twitter\nAnd uh it was mentioned at the top of the hour news where she basically said there's just not enough evidence to prosecute she goes through and see I I listened really well to what she was saying after a short time with the Democrats I'd just ten and now\nA machine goes through and says basically key thing it's like it's not corroborated by any of the witnesses that she named\nUm she's inconsistent regarding the how a a description of the uh assaulted sell shoes and inconsistent on when it happened it was there she doesn't know the location she can't tell you how she got there to the party\nOr how she got home\nOr her memory of recent events as they too she couldn't really even describe the polygraph right I'm sure this ask questions about you know the lead are getting out um things that she devolve should the Washington Post she just she couldn't answer any of that\nIt's the congressional Democrats and her attorneys may have affected her memories but I I notice that myself but it would really be good for people to get a hold of it and read it\nUh she's basically saying it's such a weak case there's just not evidence to prosecute and she's given at all to the\nG O P senators I'm sure the Democrats could get it to write the key thing that will what we need to try to focus on is no matter what the Democrats told us from the beginning\nThat we they were not going to vote for him so to me\nMakes no sense to do\nAny further investigations and my big disappointment with flake is flake has admitted that if he was running for office he would've never asked for that to me that admission\nMeans that he recognizes that the voters of Arizona would like to see Kavanaugh's confirmed and he is paid\nBy the U.S federal government part of you know as the senator from\nThe state of Arizona until January twenty Nineteen and then he probably get something after that but basically he has an obligation to represent us and I think people really need to call not\nBad names but call them and get this far sober I was further disappointed by seeing some clips of him but some global something or rather with senator codes having a good time so you\nKnow this all could be part of his uh trying to interview for a job himself doing this kind of crap to cabinet all but to me what the Democrats are doing and what a few Republicans are doing to cabinet is wrong and\nI just I'm sick of it and basically the key thing though is we need to just get the Republicans to vote for 'em you're not going to change the Democrats mine it would be nice if mansion and some of the others would act you know like responsible human beings\n[noise] but in another thing I Want to point out to everybody the Democrats knows the rules they know what an FBI background check is they know the rules of the committee what they're counting on\nThat the people listening to them don't know them so you need to understand that the process that the Republicans have conducted has been perfectly appropriate they've done everything by the book\nThe Democrats are basically just trying to abuse people's lack of knowledge\nAnd I find that objectionable but it's easy to do if you don't have the knowledge to back you up\nThat would yeah from Russia as a Russian newspaper\nOkay riders orders you can't find it connected no more used to but Reuters ... was a company that created to ... to build the image of hit or as a way I got it\nNeeded to your person ... went on to be an ... world news organization now so they have pretty much rate place or the ac and are Associated Press you'll look at the little logo on most of the news had got Reuters on there they pick and choose what they want you to know\nYou go ahead\nAnd say that but that's what's killing them oh gee I think the public is seen it that's why the press the media are losing favor because there is no real news out there that did that puts a bad light on the media the media is getting beat up and they should be about\nWell what they've done now when Trump came in he did he just eliminated that that that that the three corporate maybe it's just like your buddy George ... media you know we won't discuss but I Know what he meant\nAngler the three of the corporate media is are owned by corporations like this in General Electric what they've got some money to monopolize whatever they manufacture worldwide they will endorse this crap you could even communist actually go to Disneyland even communist or who likes to go to the world you understand what I'm saying\nAbsolutely and it is okay for me to\nWrite it anyway so so Trump ... when he came aboard when he first he always use social media he tweeted about my passion you don't have to have those ...\nAnd and I said earlier there's no silver it's it's just straight from the easy talks to rent and we should be thankful even if we can take yeah\nYeah

go\nOkay so we've had this wonderful storm last night I talked to the town I enjoyed it okay I thought it was it's great we don't get whether hearing you mother than the blazing heat and we really\nWe we haven't had the monsoons that we've had in years past and it's been dry I planted a bunch of plants in my yard over a hundred and sixty I'm sure we'll\nSee and I think you know because I knew you had like a little mini farm going on out\nThere yeah I got ... out there I got about eighty eight trees I planted you still have them so yes\nI got tree farm out there I got out of a eighty eight trees that are planted we still have them\nSo yes I Do [laughter] okay that's a good answer of the eighty eight trees that were planted I've lost one of them and to be it was because of the irrigation failed on that one tree\nAnd it dried up it wasn't because the wind blew it down and we've had a lot of when the season and you know we had a little bit of a respite this past month but I'm tired of that we've had\nA lot of ah a boobs come through ... without the rains we generally enjoy and or they've been terrorized and a lot of people's landscape and I've been walking around my neighborhood and and just seen that the excessive heat just has destroyed a lot of these shrubs and trees\nAnd uh so I've been taking special care my trees to make sure that they've been getting enough water but the wind that's another issue and so um I Want to and annoy I've talked about this in the past in fact ... right when I walked in you said hey are you doing this so you know you know the top of mind for me\nAnd a trees not only do I enjoy them they provide shade they provide a just a ... a nice little oasis in the desert but um to me that they they demonstrate a lot of metaphors to us in life and ... and so here's one of those metaphors\nMy trees I planted very very small um number one to save money being as you know you buy Fifteen gallon tree as opposed to a forty five or fifty gallon tree and it's it's a tense at the cost and number two because\nAnd we are discussing trees well [laughter] and we were Arbor our exactly is another life [laughter] and uh so let's get into some other issues here one is or how do you leave a legacy in\nIn the most efficient and effective where we'll continue on perpetually and\nOf course we specialize we focus on\nHelping individuals understand how they can have their money and um all of their life savings pass on from one generation to the next without the government digging deep in their pockets without the court getting involved in in the probate hassles and that's called good estate planning\nBut it it goes deeper than that and it's it's something that I Can't as a professional help my clients do but\nAs a ... a member of the community and I can encourage other members of the community to adopt the principles that help continue your ideals and and and your sense of giving and and charitable mindedness and and that is\nDemonstrate that through your actions with your kids involved when your kids are involved in um charitable actions they they see that they feel good because\nIt just that's one of the best feelings when when you give and you're you're providing service you get a much more than actually provide you get this this sense of gratification of helping your fellow man\nAnd a ... it's very tempting when you go out to do these types of projects whether you're going out to helping neighbor or you're going to volunteer at ... place or you're going to help somebody move\nTo leave your kids at home because they are young and you're going to trip over them and that they really get how much they're really not competent at sorting clothes or or or um distributing food and so you know what help or are they going to be well\nThe help that they are going to be is a lifetime of potential that they have as the next generation and when they're they're\nWatching you serve and help other people they not only feel good about it but they've that bond for their fellow man is established in fact I've got a story that I Want to share with our listeners out there about\nA little known hero of a World War two and the Holocaust now we're all familiar with Oscar Schindler and that thousands of Jews he's saved his famous list\nBut ah we're not as familiar with his uh counterpart it was a Japanese consulate or head of the um Japanese consulate in Lithuania his name was a ... ... and ... was\nA life long bureaucrat he grew up his his father was a government official they had a very good living and imperial Japan and ah he was fairly self indulgent\nAnd he was about forty years old when World War two being re Jean and as we know Japanese they were allies with the Germans\nAnd as the the Jews were lean trying to get refuge in Japan because Japan was actually very um hospitable to the Jews\nPre war and even somewhat throughout the war and uh in Lithuania there was a conflict where the Jews two hundred of them initially gathered at a cigar\nThe ... in Lithuania there was a conflict where the Jews two hundred of 'em initially gathered at a cigar as door to ask for visas to get out and and and to and to get respite in Japan and he petitioned um his ... his\nOfficials of supervisors to get that a permission to issue those and he was denied twice\nAnd he knew the policy that you know the Jews with we're going to be eradicated the ultimate solution was eradicate the Jews and that was that the German solution though this wasn't Japan's policy but they were out as with with Germany and so they they needed to be in line with that\nBut despite that he began issuing visas and he did this at the peril of his livelihood at the barrel of his family's even lives and uh he issued those visas\nNight and day he worked endlessly to continue to issue visas he issued to them to thousands of Jews he issued them when his health started decline and he became frail issued them in\nTo the point that his wife's health declined says she can no longer nurse their newborn baby he was\nA fired from his post as the head of the conflict there and he was he was relocated he continued to issue them until they actually escorted him from the house he issued them on the platform of the train station he continued to issue them in the train and hand them out through the windows\nAnd then beg forgiveness to those who were pleading\nFor his assistance as the train left\nAnd the question comes back as to why why would somebody who had everything to lose and really seemingly no relation to this group of individuals\nPut all of this at risk and lose it all for this purpose and the researchers there is I'm a sociologist that research this and he was a professor at ASU\nLet me pull up his name here and uh he researched this and and his answer was that uh\nHis father ran not only was he a government official but he ran in in during um she hires youth for years and and he brought in\nAll types of people and he treated those people like family he washed their clothes he helps serve meals to them he tended to them when they were ill and so he showed a lot of charity to them the name of the researcher is Robert ...\nAnd it's a book that he tells this story and it's called pre sway Asian not to be confused with persuasion it's free sway Asians a nominal book I recommend it to a\nView that are out there priests waging by Robert ... and ah he tells a story of so we are and how he does is because he\nEarly on had that seat of charity planted in him and that was more compelling for him than the wealth that he\nWas a ... that he basically gave up and his family's security because this was his\nFellow man and he wanted to make sure that that he was true to his family legacy so if you want your children to be charitable if you want your children not to be greedy and to fight with one another and to give back to the community\nThere is no miracle ... snake oil solution that you can come in to me to write for you what you've got to do is\nGot to not only do it but do it in a way that your children see it and participate in it because only by participating in it can they really adopt that sense of ah that that this is what were intended to do and be a are generally human tendency is to be selfish needs to be greedy\nBut when you go outside that you experienced the sense of unity that becomes very very powerful and that sense of unity will um\nWhen the storms come ... and it will prevail and your real legacy will live on and it'll give far more than you can give as as your own legacy because you can only earn so much in a lifetime but your children's lifetimes they can earn and give back in their children and it's and it's an infinite gift that you can get back to the community\nSo okay that's our life lessons section of today's show ... um but\nI Want to talk a little bit about Medicaid now there's a lot of people out there that the sea Medicaid as a welfare and as a government handout and is something that should be ashamed of if they accept it\nAnd I don't and the reason I don't is because I pay taxes and I liked the roads that I drive on and I and I feel like I'm entitled to drive on those roads because the taxes that I pay\nAnd my kids go to public schools and I enjoy that that privilege of them go into the public schools\nAnd all of that is receiving benefits from the government [noise]\nAnd I don't feel like that's a handout I feel like that's something that I contributed to and that I'm mutually and joined with the rest of the people the taxpayers out there that are contributing to it so why is Medicaid different why would in our time of need we need medical assistance\nLarge organizations that can provide that assistance and need funding\nWhy would I feel like that's a handout that I don't deserve I shouldn't take until I'm totally impoverished\nSo that's the mentality that's out there and I want to help people understand you have contributed to this program you have contributed to it's it's called all the ex Arizona long term care system\nAnd uh you should be like this is something that can give back to you and it's it's not a anything that is showing that you have less character or you're you're now I'm\nReceiving a government handout and you're you're no longer willing to provide for yourself you have put into this system and you you should feel OK with actually allowing it to provide back\nThey look at this house is okay this is where we can get some money to pay for the long term care so they sell the house as mom and dad go into either the nursing home or assisted living facility\nAnd or what happens is they've taken an asset that was non chemical it's not even counted in determining whether or not they qualify they converted into cash\nGeysers count double yeah and so what they've done is they've actually made it less likely that they're going to be approved for long term care benefits and so they're gonna have to spend more of those are more of their life savings on their personal care and on average a nursing home\nIn Yuma starts out around six thousand dollars a month\nAnd that's across the board and it goes up from there so if you need more ... than you know specialize assistance or if you need a special medical assistance\nTo Seventy two thousand dollars a year plus yeah that's that's not inexpensive no it's not chump change that's not Social Security money\nNo no and uh so it it becomes very difficult for individuals to be able to afford that and in fact they drain their life savings very quickly on average takes only about six months for a couple of the drain their life savings if they're paying for that on their own\nYeah so this couple um they also have a very good income gym he makes a\nPension of five thousand dollars a month and Suzie she makes one she makes Social Security basically and that's two thousand dollars a month and and so they apply no Suzie let's say she has a stroke okay so she really needs medical assistance to Jim can't take care of her um it is to mentally and physically draining on him to take care of her\nSo he applies\nFor long term care benefits for her and\nUh they get approved and the reason they get approved is because we talked\nAbout their assets their home is non count double their home furnishings hundred thousand dollars non count all their car is non count double Seventy thousand dollar Mercedes non count double their savings account is counted bowl but there's an exemption is called the community spouse resource\nExemption or deduction\nAnd uh it starts out at a approximately is between twenty three and twenty four thousand dollars twenty three four hundred twenty three yeah yeah I think twenty three thousand four hundred I might be a hundred or so off on that\nAnd that and the max\nIs a hundred and twenty three thousand four hundred and so where you get you know pegged as far as the exemption the your commute\nI think that's self explanatory spouse that doesn't need the long term care they're still in the community taking care of themselves or how much they get to keep is dependent on how much of the assets are actually determine count to ... when they actually apply for a long term care and so if a\nThese these individuals' here Jim and Suzie they were to apply\nThey're below that count double asset range because all of their assets are non ... except their savings account that twenty thousand dollars so they're below that twenty four thousand dollar threshold\nAnd so they're going to qualify resource wise for long term care benefits even the prepaid funeral plan is non violent to to the\n... if they if they qualify then and you're talking six thousand dollars a month for in Yuma first starting the Medicaid would pay for that\nYeah and so what happens is Arizona obviously uh it it has a program access that disease out the Medicaid federal dollars at that Arizona receives an access for long term care\nSub divides that further down into a program called all tax Arizona long term care system and so all tax they have partnered up\nThe banner health and so they actually have in health care insurance program so the state is going to pay it's about twenty eight hundred dollars a month to ban or health and banner health then we'll pay whatever they negotiate with the long term care facility to make sure that to Suzie is taking care of and so\nIt's not actually taking money away from the state when you apply for this because\nThey're going to have to contribute a share of costs are going to have to contribute a premium if you will each month Jim and Suzie for their care and it's going to be about twenty eight hundred dollars no in this case\nThat since she was the only makes two thousand dollars then that's all going to be it's going to be suzy's income is going to be contributed and they were going to be in Social Security income yeah Social Security and it doesn't matter where it comes from right any income I'm that person has to contribute their share of cost up to twenty eight hundred dollars\nAnd that would be the maximum was twenty eight twenty eight hundred dollars if you make twenty nine you still you pay twenty eight right to keep a hundred bucks [noise] right\nYeah and and there are some
