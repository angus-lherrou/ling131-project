association so or something to that\nOh gee I I I'm going to find oh gee wrong somewhere\nOr if you look at them that are\nOn the air ... got a couple of quick things for you what I was listening to

insurance from an affiliate embedded with the care about that is now growing over fourteen thousand well\nAnd I like that it's gotta be possible\nWhen I've seen pictures that look more than seven I mean it looks huge I Can't judge but wouldn't surprise me\nThat because my understanding is there's a lot of people that are starting to join that you'll have been a been a didn't want to sneak

booth appreciate the thought of right you take care of sick here man by\nThe um on the caravan Trump has vowed to send as many troops as necessary to keep growing migrant caravan out now\nAccording to this article was Seventy two hundred members strong and he wants to send US military suppose the national guard because remember the last time he asked for National Guard there was a lot of questions about you know what are we\nParticularly from California I Would have to use them for we don't want to use them for this we want to negotiate and and all that stuff he doesn't want you don't have to do that I guess who uses the U.S military\nBut the U.S military has to be deployed off us oil\nCan be on us soil so you'd have to put um south of the border with the permission of Mexico\nI don't know how that works out but that's what he's talking about named people asked him well how many you won these as many as it takes and where they would stop the negotiation part of it with all the states\nI'm\nTrump talks about the caravan seems a lot bigger than five which it is we've got to stop at the border unfortunately when you look at the countries they have not done their job this is this is President Trump Guatemala and Honduras El Salvador oh\nThey're paid a lot of money every year and we give them foreign aid they did nothing for us nothing so we give them tremendous amounts of money hundreds of millions of dollars they they like a lot of others do nothing\nFor our country so he's ready to send in the troops and put a stop to at night or with the ...\nOf course they would have to even have to get agreement from Mexico because your day they'd have to be south of the border they can't be on us soil which\nWould be interesting\nAnd and I don't know that that's a negative and and here's why I say that there is some poll numbers out there and it's a little Lisa booth wrote an article about micro caravan is a political gift\nTo Trump\nAnd I didn't look at like that way in fact when I first looked at it I looked at it as a as you know a landmine but the Trump sees it differently and he doesn't mind jumping in front of it as something that's admire rubble about him as a as a as a leader\nHe'll jump right into it\nWas why the media focuses solely on the humanitarian aspect and they do the media says women children women children they show pictures guess what the women children except an isolated views it occasionally when they when they are when they look for them and I guess they find some women and children because obviously there was a few there\nBut they don't show that signs that they don't show the pictures of um tearing the gates down in Mexico these military age to young men\nThey also don't don't show\nSome of the polling numbers of Americans and how they feel about it go into Harvard the Harris Poll showed that Seventy percent of Americans want stricter informants for enforcement of our immigration laws Seventy percent that's why the Democrats are being quiet on this whole thing they're not saying anything to Seventy percent\nSixty one percent believe our current border security is an adequate eighty four percent of Americans oppose sanctuary cities sixty nine percent oppose abolishing eyes\n\n... this is only in mind for the Democrats not for Trump\nNot for President Trump for President Trump this is not a land line ... ... this is a landmine according to these poll numbers for anyone that says let's open up the borders and that's where we got all of a lot of them are Democrat candidate that's open up the

[laughter] yeah so that's why we have red lights green and yellow light right [laughter] I don't know why don't you know you're right I don't want to [laughter] oh my God we got to know a problem with the bending the rules a little optional rules\n... oh my gosh you know speaking of optional rules on one\nThat I that I really I'm Still trying to wrap my head around and uh I don't know if you saw it but it's a sea out of bounds\nOptional local rule that you see that\nYes so\nUp until up until now the majority of recreational players what do they do it for much like what you said about the water hazard idea they hit a ball out of bounds they race on down there they can't find their boss so they drop one right near where they thought it went on about right\nOkay and so they may say hey I'm hit my second or they add the penalty shot and are hitting their third\nWell that is now the proposed local rule that clubs can adopt four tournament play which says you hit your ball out of bounds\nYou grow up to where you believe it went out of bounds you can now drop it on the\nEdge of the fairway equally distant from the point at which it went out of bounds and you're now hit or your fourth shot I wanted to see what you thought about that\nWell I don't understand I mean they're they're giving your opinion do you for the distance\nRight yeah I mean that's what they're doing you give me any additional penalties for the distance\n\n[laughter] so instead of instead of re hitting from the tea\nOr or wherever you were um right you know if you're in the fairway whatever it might be a year being penalized in issue stroke or the distance\nA well ...\nKnow assuming that you hit your tee shot out of bounds mhm okay they didn't the distance penalty as to you would return to the tea hitting the earth third correctly to speed up\nPlay you drop it equally distant from where it went out in the ... the fairway I mean you are now assuming that your third shot there so now you're having your fourth\nOh you're kidding on your ... I'm Sorry bread I thought you said you're lying for\nNo no no I'll tell you if you hit him or her yeah yeah\nWell that's a play about I mean that you have to pay to play I I I don't I don't see any other reason for that changing\nOther than last a ball and trying to keep people out of people's backyards in into brush and you only play up in northwest I mean you hit a ball out of balance Jesus guide and get lost jobs are looking for\nThat day you know in a manner yeah a\nSouth once you get bit by them down here you know they'd buy some exactly [laughter] ... oh\nYeah [laughter] but ah yeah but yeah I'm a I could\nSee where that's definitely a a a page to play but I also see it as a I'm Sorry but a tremendous advantage\nI I I don't I don't I Know like a rule or what the lover oh yeah I don't\nYeah well and that's assuming that the next ball is in fact going to be in the fairly\nRight could blow the next one out of our right they go you know\nA little bit of it I Would think but at the same time I'm sure you associate consider the fact that the ball that went out of bounds probably had some curvature to it or you know was not going to be as good as one head straight away so you give up a little bit of distance there as well so I guess there was a trade off I'm sure\nYeah but you can be like high in in in lye eat right right yeah that's true you can be played by in late\nExcept for your three drops that's true yeah that's true well yeah and so I I don't know I ... I get it for most for most everyday golfers I get it uh yeah\nI certainly wouldn't want to be playing those rules in tournament golf or in a money game of any kind\nUm you know uh but uh\nBecause I Do see it as an unfair advantage specially a person you know we've got these guys did a they hit at three twenty three thirty ... have no idea where it's going but\nThey're you know temp far you know and ... your line three inside the hundred yard marker every single time I mean\nUh and you have a handicap yeah it is a huge advantage exactly that is a huge advantage um\nSo I don't know some ... but I ...\nA right to so many people\nYou know Brent honestly so many people to play the game of golf don't understand the rules well enough as it is\nAnd you know the\nYou know there was in a bowl out of bounds and you know ... Persian turns religion now what am I supposed to do\nRight and a day\nAnd then they go up and they look for their ball after the ... and ... is a time killer\nA show or I could smell and\nThe ... the the proposed change mark also eliminates a a you know because you don't know whether it's last year and what are the ... side as well you know so what's your dollar time killer\nRight ... ... so\nYeah so there are they just go go up and you know the only problem is of course hitting a ball right now and if I drop you're on a facade\nOf ours was lost and then what\nDo you do that in ... assume if he didn't say o'clock you know ...\n... there's going to be some interpretation I'm sure there's going to be some decisions that will be made by the U.S as well as to as to how it all comes into effect but everything goes into effect January first so right so\nI went to I don't know I see mid a high handicappers you know benefiting tremendously from that role in an icy a and I certainly see a golf courses pace play ah and you know especially down here in Arizona where\nYou know so many of our golf courses are just cut right out of the desert and like you know there's there's desert terrain and the left side on the right side behind the green behind the tea boxes I mean you know you go out there in Iraq couldn't apply good lord knows where that things are going to go\nOut actually you know so I'm\nA ... is just\nLike you said it up in the northwest and you you know you've got very very heavy under brush and\nAnd uh you know that\nThere are there really are no ruptured I mean it's just ... bull a year in the joke\nA comedian so\nUh I don't know but I didn't I definitely see it as an advantage to page ... definitely damage pays ... you know bread I get it and we're we're going to jump up on break take one more break and we'll be back wrap this up being great show today a let's get some more rules okay but [noise]\nThey're in their shoes the desert southwest kind of show five sixty AMC deal [noise]\nHey do you see right now did you watch all prescription eyewear every pain every brand is ... percent off any of the fifty percent thanks to my friends and family events like even matter in applied math classes and sound laugh and that's the vision\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nI Try to get you have to Rio de surveys October twenty seven to not do it now and we'll do surveys dot com you don't want to miss one of the schools to bash George ... stadium in Rio de each rate so", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "23"}
