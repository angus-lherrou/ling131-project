Nineteen Seventy six there your electrician the I'm\nNot talk to Edward guarantees our text him really this morning you questions about market here's what I was looking for without asking the question and and I'm just I'm just reading one of his blog post this morning\nWhat I'm Wondering without asking him because I didn't I didn't know if it's just\nYeah um 'cause I didn't didn't know if it's just my paranoia or whatever with the election in full swing right now election you can go vote today in the human county by the way you can go vote to leave town or something just go downtown and vote early voting out the ballots were mailed on Wednesday so you should receive in him\nWant to see something this drastic happened I'm like the stock market is it political no I didn't ask ... Edward doesn't really get into the political part of things in fact he stays clear of it so that he stays focused on on what he does for a living and that's a investment and helping investors and things like that\n[noise] what do you even writes in ... in his blog about you know\nI'm\nThe self doesn't make sense because the fundamentals good economies rock solid all those kinds of things but which ... the question is how quickly the fed wants to live the feds or the fed wants to kill the economy as raising rates too fast will cause great harm\nAnd I think everybody knows that that's not that's not a new thing has caused great horned the defense\nAnd I've always wondered if it helps you they're not they're supposed to be apolitical they're not supposed to be trumped arrangements syndrome or or pro GOP or anything like that it's supposed to be neutral but are they really and and do they schedule things to coincide with voting and of course almost from strong suits and the GOP going into the selection is\nThe economy stupid\nSo my you know\nMy thought process being you know paying more attention to politics and I do numbers was when something like this happens is that a coincidence that happens right on the voting day opens is it a coincidence that the the feds I'm making noise about interest rates and stuff like that cause\nA stock market you know which is one of Trump's strong so not not the only one just one of them\nIs that intentional is it a is it a is a coincidence [noise] I don't believe that much and go incidents really so I'm thinking maybe I I Can't get that from Edward I wouldn't ask it 'cause he purposely stays away\nFrom the politics generally\nYou know I talked about my little terrorists from this morning thirty ... granddaughter that destroyed everything when I say destroyed I mean it can be fixed I mean I can sweep the floors [laughter] you know I should I should do it anyway I I can sweep up I\nShe likes these little little vanilla they're like crackers but for babies you know they're so they don't choke on them or whatever they dissolve quicker and everything she likes them as you go through the whole can of those no time I don't think she ate each ten percent of them I don't think ten percent get eaten\nI Would doubt it\nSo I was teaching or yesterday how to pick him up off the floor and put him in the garbage and it was it was a game you know we didn't game go pick up all your trash and let's put it in the garbage I Wish they did that at Yellowstone but they don't they just I mean if I if I started keeping her trash and categorizing it for for\nA you know future future people to look and say look what someone through look what the baby terrorists did\nYears ago no we throw it away we go eat off the floor [laughter] I guess that's something we've all learned of you know the thirty year old the thirty ... terrorists though she doesn't know ran a story this morning made me sad about that speaking of the terrorists\nThat called the lawyer before calling nine one one about a ... child\n\nWhich is got to be something you know something I I'd I'd I don't know how you would feel because I don't I don't know that I can I could put those put that together and it's just got to be something that\nUm is only acceptable but\nCalled a warrior asked a lawyer my my child is did as a door now ten month old daughter\nAsked advice or advice was call you know don't do anything 'til I get there from lawyer but you know call nine one one where they\nDid call nine one one and called nine one one dispatcher asked\nYou know about how we found her you know wants to be on health care that she says oh yeah uh she did as a door now\nI'm just a zoo and talk like that I mean I Know my thirty ... one year old terrorist is trouble but I Would protect her for with everything I've gone ...\nWould not even I don't know that I could come up with any words on on her condition at that point I don't know\nHow to get the other child starve to death so yeah now I understand the callousness\nOf these a parent's\nJob was ten months old and and weighed eight pounds a death skeletal like posture\n\nAnd a according to those are the scene and to the judge it just horrific as it gets bad when the judge says that and yes they've been charged felony murder as they should be but I don't get it I don't understand it that anybody would harm torture starve\nTen month old child I don't know I don't know where that gums\nDispatcher asked how he's doing because when you call a dispatcher police in nine one one and you say my child is dead\nI'm sure they're trained to make sure that they take care of whoever's calling they've gone to\nThey want to make sure everybody's okay that they so she as how're you doing he said you know just another day it is what it is\nOkay sky deserves jail time and the wife they're both they're both charged felony murder to lead a ten month old starve to death\nIn their care that they see every day and watch your waste away\nHave no idea what's going on in that in that situation but it's unusually striking when you have children of\nYour own a granddaughter of your own and those kinds of things it becomes a tougher tougher to uh to understand tougher to to think about\nWhat goes on in the minds of people that could actually let that happen if you don't want a child adoptions\nFamily call child protective services turn yourself in\nA lot better than felony murder\nI'm\nBetter news hurricane now has better although it was devastating I didn't take it I took it for granted I I knew it was coming in I read some of the reports\nAbout it and I uh I've seen many go up the Gulf there used to live in Tampa I see may go up in the Gulf and they they generally don't hit that hard this one dead to hit a category for I think\nHit hit George's a three so I went across land tightly packed in it was a\nA seeing pictures from some of it and if you get a chance to like some of the pictures it just strip the trees you know the the limbs of the branches and it's it's eerie Logan looks like a bomb went off in some of those places and ripped off roofs\nAre so far they're talking about two deaths are so that um\nYou know children and stuff you know the trees fall so it looks like a lot of people got out the heat of the warnings are used to it they they did get out and I don't know of any other um\nAny other problems but people did get out something else that happened during the evacuation Tesla got involved they remote control Lee extended car batteries to help people that were driving away and Tesla so they could reach an additional forty miles\nOf course that gets my interests like well why don't they just do that anyway [laughter] why why why why are you doing that now and and can they just do that on the fly patently yes apparently can program your car Tesla can\nOther car companies don't do it even if I can I guess they don't do it um because most law so you have to go through a dealer\nThey don't have dealers does doesn't it doesn't have a single dealer anywhere so they just do it\nOr they just rip program I guess you know like your computer sometimes it's a computer until you know you've got some updates wants to restart at ...\nAnd the moderate that we've done hey doing what or good morning that the beautiful that oh God\nThe Democratic party it yeah if you want to keep and bear that around voter and she'll give them she doesn't want to do you find them right to sport and she also ... I didn't want to get rid of Obamacare\nAnd if you like saying well if you liked sanctuary city yeah well the lady that she'll keep them there for yet\nI cringe every time they vote for it I mean I Know who you're sarcastic but I still like to hear\n[laughter] I Would say don't vote for because look you're right she stands for that she stands for open borders and he's trying to she she's trying to the mask or real direction by saying I'm for border barrier which means nothing three three by three by ... barrier it's not a wall\nAnd Martha McSally who is the one that should be getting your vote\nIs ah the one that's going to expose\nThe fact that we don't need sanctuary cities and and expose why we need a wall and support the president and his tax cuts and support President Trump on his move forward with a foreign policies and security for our country\nWhere you know they have to live a lady yellowish flying mother mean killing machine around I called the war at all\n[laughter] yeah it's a a ... a tan and it's it's it's just a big go gun with wings on it what it is\nAnd thirty millimeter cannon which is kind of kind of a friend of the ground troops that 'cause they when they when they get in trouble they want to see those things coming to help 'em out that's what Martha McSally to\nKill anybody flying one they had run out of a big gap between their legs\nSo well yeah I think we're sitting right on top of it there in the bathtub and die [laughter] yeah\nAnd you know what that's what that might make Sally will do for the people of Arizona\nYeah I don't take that they got ... and put it to work for the people that the reason I'm going to vote their necks out and said she wants to look out for me [noise] mhm I don't believe in killing baby I don't believe in Russian girl I have to pay for it\nShe'll be she'll be a big help to President Trump and President Trump is more and more comics Sally and uh and that's a big deal right now I don't know if the policies are are are in play and and they're working great for all aspects of our economy from a new jobs and start ups and businesses\nAre were thriving right now which booming and a mix alleys going going to be a big part of that she is already is as represented but also was a senator a big part of that in the support of that with the uh as as President Trump is ... the GOP and the Republicans\nFrom you know we had a rough start there was many ... you know Trump dream German syndrome and you know what they're all they're all on their way out and people like Martha McSally on their way and\nThat is true ah I think I've heard that um that that President Trump is gonna be coming into Arizona yeah I've heard that may be able to have another town off mic Cali\nYeah it would be nice and uh but he's he's out there every day I don't know I don't know how he does it but these out there ... it looks like every day I'm doing something for somebody to ... uh he's given more support for the Republican Party they every day for him\nWhich is is huge really huge\nAnd this is the way that people shedding the Republican Party as you know I put up a lotta Kelly large\nSign yeah when when she lost we went and took them down and now I'm going to do everything I can get help make Sally\nAnd that's the way we all should be ... column I lay we shouldn't be and I expect that from you\nAnd now I'm going to do everything I can help make Sally\nAnd that's the way we all should be ... column I lay we shouldn't be and I expect that from you\nI mean forgive me but I just take that for granted that's who you are and all of us need to be\nGetting ready to make that from the rest of the republic and\nYes and I've been beat up by a lot of Republicans doesn't matter I'm Still a huge supporter of\nGun I Know that for a fact uh I Know what you're saying is true yeah average it looked like well I'm a deli gotta order\n[laughter] felt like it [laughter] and they live at one and they play it today [laughter] appreciate the call buddy you have a good that you do that yeah\nI'm just some good news all mix alley now\nFor those would be the do pay attention to the polls in watching those things out there or you will know that the polls do like a real clear politics and all that the polls have been favoring cinema for quite for for quite some time pretty much from the start like white by three percent not a huge thanks do within Margery Mayer and all\nThose kinds of things but they just changed drastically they changed huge\nThey changed by nine percent right now Martha McSally is hit by six points just released by ABC Fifteen on site polls doesn't surprise me in fact I I Know I've talked to some friends over in Washington DC saying when a President Trump going to come out here and and make sure there's more to make Sally things gets jailed up\nAnd gets an image and gets secured and they showed me he's coming and that um\nDon't worry Ross this is this is not what you think it is and they wouldn't tell me more than that but when I read the report this morning says make more than six hours of six points\nI guess they knew what they were talking about they didn't want to tell me but it's not unusual that's happening all over the country right now and I think I think Martha mix Sally is getting some help from people like Hillary Clinton\nFrom from people like I'm Single so we got in there the I'm\nEric Holder is I was drawn a blank on Eric Holder or Clinton holder and others the Democrats have have gone completely off the reservation now on mob rule\nAnd people don't like it the cabinet thing was ridiculous in the cabinet thing I I think affected the polls also we we we knew it would and now the new polls are coming out and the margins are changing\nAnd Republicans are taking stronger leads\nAll over the entire country I think they are killing themselves they're asking for ... revolt everything from Hillary Clinton which says we were abandoned civility\nShe says we cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that's that's Hillary just just this week Tuesday sing a phone call you on the air\nI think you meant sending a set of like Sally used to make child he was getting help from the Clintons\nThan you would be right [laughter] pretty she had the Gulf thank you Bye bye yeah make Sally is getting help because of the attitude of Hillary Clinton the attitude of Eric Holder yeah whatever color just said yesterday when they go low we kick them what\nThe end and that's and and that's and that's the new Democratic Party now she's he's not speaking for himself and he says that's a new Democratic Party and it makes sense\nI mean they're exposing themselves if they because we're all in unison you you've got it Hillary Clinton saying you know they've abandoned civility because you can't have it until we get back in power you got Eric Holder who wants to be a twenty twenty a candidate for president saying if you go\nWe'll kick 'em that's the new Democratic Party\nI thought you know I I don't know that sounds like a man when he's down that I Know he means low is as far as a you're not playing fair and will kick you\nShall we got we got we got ... Maxine Waters impeached forty five don't let them read don't let them be peaceful in a restaurant don't let them get gasoline\nTalking about anybody on on presidents' staff for cabinet\nAnd now you are\nI guess Conway county is going to be with President Trump today and there was some ... some of the reporters on uh CNN MSNBC I don't remember one are out there calling in and the you know the token negro type stuff\nAnd insane\nThat's the rhetoric from the left that's what's going on in his mom rule did you see what they did spring court you know the the peaceful women\nThat were clawing if the doors and demonstration when they were a lot it's it's all about mob and screaming during the Kavanaugh thing and it was orchestrated unplanned by by they paid organizers from the Democratic party and billionaires are investing money into it they think that's the way to go and they started at\n... even right after the election the resistance groups scream yell and get attention that's how we get back into power and I think the I think the country thank goodness is rejecting\nIn North Dakota Heidi Heidi Heitkamp she's a Democrat in ... in North Dakota you know running for her life she's running for re election\nIn this atmosphere well she doesn't like it you know she says it's ridiculous that's ridiculous\nShe says I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring stability back into politics and that goes for both sides and she's she's attacking Hillary Clinton because she knows it's killing her she knows that kind of talk is not playing well and they don't care they're they're\nAll the leadership of the Democrats from what I've seen anecdotally that'd be Clinton and Eric Holder\n... do you [noise]\n... you ...

pulled out is concealed weapon and shot him in the chest I put a stop to stuff\nAnd the cops I'm an employee at Starbucks as I get good old guys had shut the man in the chest a man's lives in the hospital and he's he's not feeling well he's been arrested for for all his shenanigans\nAnd the police you interviewed the permit holders he's a concealed weapon permit holder mild mannered guy in fact some of the star of so many employees and Starbucks didn't didn't think you know they were kind of surprise\nIs that I Would never expected that from him he just seemed like a very meet guys so I was surprised but also very grateful I was grateful that he was there and I was glad I ... it was a somebody we see regular so that hopefully in the future I can think him so it's a regular customer goes into Starbucks early in the morning\nJust carrying a concealed weapon that nobody knew he had nobody knew he was that you know that he was a kind of got to stand up what he did and uh this poor lady at Starbucks who was getting kicked I was afraid for her life she thought she thought he was trying to kill her\nUm\nBut when he came to do it just had her from behind I mean it wasn't a conversation just did it for mine but he was fleeing something over the seven eleven so that you know we don't hear enough stories about that about the um\nHaving some good guys on what good it does for us and you never know and and I'm sure this guy and you know who knows how long you carry a concealed weapon who knows how long he he had that on him and it just stayed concealed\nNobody rounded knew what they were surprised Starbucks people known names regular never expected it from the ... guy\nBut it happened and the good guy\nYou know slowed down stopped a bad situation and those guys in the hospital with charges probably handcuffed to a gurney right now\n\nMichael [laughter] and not and I'm Talking about the storm is a tropical storm today but it hit hard\nAnd they said the I was so big it at three states at one time and that but but it was concentrated it was a category three by the time it's Georgia you know we've been on for landfall and they're they're picking up all the pieces today and figuring out you know all the devastation and what's going on so hopes and prayers to\nPeople all along the Florida and Alabama Georgia\nIt's a it's called ... have you see some of the pictures and I've I've got some of them here but uh it just it just devastated just ripped rip the trees clean there's no leaves on trees\nAnd branches are gone it's just a did a homes are are flat and destroyed where where it hit with the most powerful wins and things and of course you've got three hundred thousand people without electricity and Georgia three and fifty thousand\nOr three hundred and eighty thousand in Florida\nAnd that's going to take some time\nFor the emergency crews get out there and make sure that they put all that infrastructure back into place that takes that doesn't happen overnight that could take days\nOff we know more than just days but uh they're comfortable storm is still moving forward is still causing some some rain some showers and what search and rescue is out there today the lights are on and uh hopefully everybody's okay\nOut in that area there were two deaths that they know about it had to do with trees falling\nIll trees falling on a house and people inside the house so yeah those are trees when it gets that saturated and and and the ... they can blow over the roots may not be as stable as you think they are are like we just saw here at the heart in the ...\nSo we are blowing through the hurricane blow through here we didn't have that big a win but a big enough to to throw some big trees down over the mall area where they planted them they'd be I mean they didn't grow up there they didn't mature there or were they brought them in big and put them down there they didn't have the root structure\nAnd crushed in Moscow and I saw the Mazda out there and talk to the owners will but he was fine ... you know he wasn't crying over anything you know he wasn't happy but he's just you know we get we get new what they'll do fine you know the insurance\nSo and and that came into play when he kept the park to under the tree you know\nNice which car in the shade\nNicer if there had root structure you know they don't blow over or but it didn't surprise me at the heart can see it or where they built that and they put the trees in the priest and grow and mature there they they were put in so that makes sense to me\n[noise] Mexican police officers held on a mess found in his car and she ... police officer may have something in the car because they made an arrest or they you know making something up you know France for no he's a Mexican police officer on interstate five in San Diego\n... ... ... what are you doing there is that when they pulled him over to forty one year old McGill petroleum look nervous\nAnd I'm produced identification showing it showing wearing a badge is I'd identification you know in in the old ... old pulled him over showed his police identification\nThinking maybe get some professional courtesy or something he's out on two hundred that he's being held on two hundred thousand or bail apparently can't transport fifty pounds of methamphetamine even if you're a police officer from another country I'm sure that all gets sorted out and figured that went all out at some point\nThe I'm poor guy\nFifty pounds of math that seems to be a lot I'm sure it's been when I got a text from my uh\n\nMy investor friend says you're seeing a lot about selling I mean you know just computer programs automatic selling well you know when they hit thresholds or whatever that's just automatic once it's you know the parameters are set up by the investors so the ... he says uh\nDo you folks to hold on hold they hold [laughter] uh yeah don't don't panic you're seeing a lot of bought selling\nA because there's a lot of things up for automatic on all that\n\nSays ah you know the other is a little while ago when I mentioned um I just picked up my phone\nWhen I when I mentioned the the early balance you know put it you know the post office will pick it up well Bob Johnson takes me and says the post office does not do not home delivery\nPick up every home and he's right when even ... always think about that but he's right you know some neighborhoods have the group boxers which you can just go to the group boxes and there's a slot\nThat it's that puts it in the slot it's locked up and secured at the post office will pick up for those and then there's others like St Louis where they don't do any I don't know how they do that but San Luis I'm Talking Arizona the United states of America\nYou know when we put the stamp on a letter it's supposed to be taken to the home we thought with dozens and ways just goes post office box that's all they got\nHe never did home delivery in San ... I don't know how the post office does that how can they just say okay we're not delivering these homes\nAnd family like they don't matter or in other communities all get delivery mini right to the house and others of course I'm you know the ...\nAnd other communities all get delivery many right to the house and others of course I'm you know the group boxes some communities\nThat are set up with group boxes where your street may have a you know a group box of ten Fifteen your neighbors are twenty or neighbors whatever\nIt is a but still you can if you have an early ballot you can take 'em right there to those group box and stick them in a\n[noise] news talk horse and up to the weather from five sixty maybe I'll use\nOnly an eighty five today sixty eight overnight tonight partly cloudy

there on ...\nElectric they um trumpet signed the bill to help patients from over paying for drugs which is\nWhich is good at the drug that the drug industry loves America because America loves drugs you know I think we consume most drugs [noise] we we can say more drugs anybody else you know we just do\nBut um what they're expensive expense of all the research and development stuff that goes into drugs I mean we pretty much pick up the tab rest of the country doesn't necessarily we took a step on Wednesday to keep customers more pain on prescription drugs and it was a surprise in here for me is easy removed and correct the gag rules\nThe gang girls I didn't know there was a gag rule\nUh but apparently in in my law pharmacists couldn't tell with customers that you'd get a better deal if you pay\nCash they couldn't tell you ...\nI don't know which ... who puts those guy goes on and say this is where lobbyist come in and all that they'll lobbyist for the pharmaceuticals at some point or you'll lobbied for rules that it would be good for the country to have gag rules\nFor the pharmacist they can't tell you you can just you know getting cheap item by um direct [noise]\nI've been finding out that more and more by myself it's it's so hard in the in the\nMedical industry the medical industry is is is is is it's just hard to see what's going on there you don't know what anything cost you don't you don't know how the systems work as far as how much the insurance pays for what the drug really cost and what your best deals are you going to win in Iowa I'm On a a medication only take one\nBut a narcolepsy and I have a mild form of dark collapsing you know which is mostly just excessive tiredness so I take this new gel bill that keeps me alert\nWhen I first started when I first found out and and I and I've got diagnosed by that the sleep center which was unusual because when people think they have and they don't\nBut um the the uh\nThe pills were like six hundred dollars a month you know for these things\nSix hundred a month and that's crazy money right and and ... and I and I'm very happy either they're not they're not pills or dangerous or attacking liver you know side effects are horrendous or any of that stuff and ... and some pilots have been taking since Vietnam\nOr just just to just shut the off the sleep just shuts off and it's really nice it's really it doesn't give you ... it's not a speed or anything like that so it was really nice but six hundred dollars\nA ... which is okay and I had insurance and my co pay was you know forty bucks or ... or something so it was okay [noise]\nWell and then all of a sudden I didn't have insurance you know as as I wasn't a casual visor and I didn't have insurance and I'm looking at six hundred dollars a month well that's a lot you know so I ... it it goes generic with a generic doesn't even help so I I started asking questions\nFrom people like like how can I get the best price and all that and I and I started talking to a pharmacist\nSay look how can you say me money on this drugs I got to pay for it now and and I I went to Dave over a casino pharmacy when it was there\nAnd I said ah\nI said I Am paying for this out of pocket cash what can you help me with 'cause I felt comfortable not he's a local guys ... he's a he's a great guy really like him\nAnd uh and he uh\nHe said well and I was buying them three months at a time that we don't want to go every month I buy\nMedication any any came back in ... and he said uh\nLike two hundred and fifty dollars or something I thought wow that's better\nFor the three months for ... for less than a hundred a month now instead of six hundred a month because I asked the question is yeah yeah what can a mark up to these guys have and and and I guess they put the six hundred dollars a month on there for the insurance companies\nI guess and then the insurance company at all then I guess it looks like you're saving a ton of money\nWith the insurance companies it looks like you're saving like wow it's forty dollars instead of six hundred look how much money I'm saving for the from the insurance company than God Bless you insurance company for paying the other five hundred bucks well they didn't pay the other five hundred dollars\nAnd I was paying eighty all of a sudden it was six hundred a month down to eighty a month or so\nAnd\nAll because I just asked\nWhen when Dave Dave sold out to another company and I went in and talk to them and it's a it's a big corporation and I said I Want to pay cash I said okay it's like six hundred dollars or five hundred or something\nI said well why don't you have a cash ... no ... okay forget it right now\nSo you know I went to the United way and other people ask you know because I knew they had to help uh in you know for people so how does that work I mean how do you how do how do you get companies to do what they did for me and all that and and and the medication I'm taking in is not very common so it's not listed\nSo I went to see ... I went online and I and I got a coupon\nThat was a coupon online where I could pick it up at CDC for I don't know eighty five dollars that's a really from instead of six hundred I could just get on line and then pick it up for eighty five dollars\nSo I went into a CBC and I showed them the coupon I says well let's just get it ordered and what will figure something out [laughter] okay that's fine order I came in and they said we might have a better in store coupon\nIs okay and and ended up being like Seventy six dollars\nSo it's a mystery to me I don't even know how it works all of it I just do you have to ask a ton of questions you've got to get on the right people are you going to ask people that that are willing to tell you\nWhat you got to ask for cash now it looks like a a Trump is designed to gag rule and maybe that's what I was running into and I didn't know it was a gag rule they weren't allowed to tell me\nThat the pricing on the stuff\nPharmacists have been contractually prohibited from telling customers when they would actually save money by not using their insurance plans\n\nContractually obligated to gag them and not tell them\nWell and good fortune maybe that I found out that I did find when I did find out um by by just asking questions and and talking to enough people not and just being determined that I was I going to find a way to pay cash in to the end to do it properly and to do it a reasonably good right and and I I didn't know it was a\n... I didn't know I was going to get done but I was a term and it was going to what all the medical industries like that\nYou know and I had a CEO from a medical IT guy yesterday on the phone don't ask him if he's working on he's not he's not gonna work for a hospital he works for an IT for him but he says that's part of what they're working on going forward is to make things transplants or you can you can go on line and say you know what's going on because nobody knows\nIt we don't know what it cause you you can't quote you a price but by law if you take your car to a shop\nAnd it and it's got a big problem and and and they they look at it and they and they don't know yet they haven't taken it apart but they look at it and they give you a quote and they said well it's going to cost you eight hundred dollars legally they have to they they make you sign that eight hundred dollars\nLook at it and they give you a quote and they say well it's going to cost you eight hundred dollars legally they have to they they make you sign that eight hundred dollars they can't Costa ... more than eight hundred at that point unless they call you and renegotiate it and say look I took your car parts worse than I thought there's this other thing\nWell medical doesn't work that way medical should work like that I should say look what's going on because they should tell you a thousand dollars and if they find something else as you'd wake you up on Facebook because we found another problem you know can we know they want us to approve this you know whatever\nBut hospitalization is Crazy Stupid you know when I was on hospital board for for nine years on the operating board and and I can tell you um it's it's it's a mystery to everybody you know it all works\nYou know we we say a procedure is going to be two thousand dollars knowing that insurance is is going to pay less than half that we know\nThe day you put the price out no one's ever go to collect two thousand but that's the that's the price or to match our discounts good look every hospital has discount you know we give a Red Cross you know sixty percent off or something like that you know I I don't know what the numbers are\nYour head rub it in ...

know what you're doing a ...

weekend a but that's what I wanted to come talk to you about what is what's going on this weekend\nOkay and I and I realize I'm volunteering and helping yes we are you very much happy to do are\nSupporting us so uh as you know when a tropical storm rose they hit a lot of damage here in town a lot of trees up rooted power was down a lot of places and one of those places that are was hit by the power outage was the in the community food bank\nOr they lost power for actually for over twelve hours and so there are cooler was down\nAnd uh you know they're very particular about food safety there because they distribute to so many agencies and they have to be or not just to people that come to get food from them every day but they distribute food to crossroads Michigan\nI'm In other agencies that help feed our I'm running challenge families right um so they ended up having to\nThrow away all of their perishable stuff\nWhich is not a happy day not a happy day at all no so it's hard for them to get that\nMuch and this is a bad time of year because you know the population isn't that strong right now because the farmers rather towns and overdrawn town it's just now starting to spoil in what they're dry\n[noise] exactly and at the same time\nThe a migrant workers are starting to come in we're starting to see more people flux in a little bit there's going to be more narrow leading yeah all the food bank for help ah so we decided to get together and come up with an idea let's see if we could help us so we keep up with the idea to feed our food bank\nAnd they're going to make sure that they pack their pre owns with the cars that they know you're interested in in this market so if you need to get out in the dunes in four wheel drive go see Hyundai\nThere's not a Hyundai car I'd want to take in the dunes four wheel drive in but there's some on the lives that are pre owned that definitely and here's the advantage\nIf your mind to bring on car you don't know where it's been what's going on and all that they're going to come with the car facts and checked out there to be checked out by their own technicians so that you're proud of them you're happy with them because this whole thing about them selling used cars\nIs because they want to take care of the community they want returned customers they want you to be a Hyundai customer for life and I get a treat every transaction just like that\nSo that cars going to be something you're proud of unhappy with and then pricing you think well I can buy better from my neighbor whatever\nLook they're completely aware of that check the car facts and I mean the Kelley Blue book whatever and make sure they recommended they are and they're going to be right in there in line with what you need because they weren't returned business they want you back by that new car\nAnd they want to take care of all your transportation stuff's go see Hyundai of Yuma tell them I said hello and that ah there's still a friend of the show the I'm a technology courses always something that I'm interested in and paying attention to\nAlthough I'm not a a ... a geek because that means I don't I'm a user I'd I don't know how to fix it or work out the minor details\nUm but I really appreciate the lot of the technologies particularly in the drones now I don't own one\nAnd I know most ... you know around Christmas Time they were you know thousands and thousands hundreds of thousands of these things sold all over the world people are buying them and sometimes are being used for various issues\nOr you know intelligence gathering spying on your neighbors or maybe even terrorists and and that's something FBI Christopher Wray has just come out and talk to the Senate about on Wednesday\nAnd debt drones maybe terrorists next to Joyce and obviously it's something that they're interested in and working on as far as uh fourteen those efforts and stopping drones but it's got to be talking a lot of these things are very small\nAnd they can be used just to gather intelligence wake where by setting where they doing as well as explosives and we saw some it happened in Venezuela or the other day where a drone flew some explosives in that uh was unsuccessful in I guess causing serious damage in any way\nBut it shows it shows the thought process and the potential and all this stuff is right off the shelf or but it also talks about the maybe the possible chemical biological radiological on these open air venues where some of these drones are now\nMaybe the possible chemical biological radiological on these open air venues where some of these drones are now a very fast very compact compact and very responsive to the flight controls\nAnd free programming a GPS all those kinds of things that they're you know sophisticated and sophisticated and I just over the counter stuff this isn't something you have to have technicians working on and secret to develop a these are developed in and it it is not getting escaped by our law enforcement officers\nWhich is good and uh the anti drone technologies I'm sure being worked on every day but we don't hear about it [laughter] except that I Know that somebody was gosh when was it a few years back here in um Yuma my garage door quit working\nBecause\nBecause somebody's playing with those signals and I find out that it's you know I Can't remember if it's if it was the Marines or the army was YPG or whatever but um they had to do something with uh the single bands and\nAnd they they screwed up all the garage doors and where I used to be a block away and open up my garage door I had to have my bumper almost touching the door to have a snake effect because something was going on I ... I still don't know exactly\nExactly what but I Know they're always working on on controlling those signals working on them and I and I don't know\nWhat the anti terrorist type activity is but it's nothing it's a scapegoat or FBI Director or any of our military uses which has been struggling with them in overseas for many years\nBut yeah when you buy that new um that new joint and give me one I\nI I've resisted I've never bought one eye and and yeah I think they're neat I play with them a little bit and hand them back to the owner but I'm never I haven't seen one yet that I Need I don't need it for anything I I guess I don't do enough spying but I always enjoy absolve Bob Barr off one from ya and play with it for a day and I'll give it back\nIn New York\nA man was just arrested poll

at all\nGetting getting back to this or election day election day I'm a celebration thing uh this guy Paul Rosen field was manufacturing andme explosive device Mm [noise] [noise] [noise] and and it was already and they founded by the way they found it\nIn any he'd been buying a lot of black powder on the Internet getting delivered a fifty six year old guy that decided that uh he he didn't like the way the country's going he's part of the uh the new Democrat mob rule do\nNew Democrat Eric Holder kick them when they go low the new Democrat era you know Hillary Clinton no civility until we're in power again or Maxine Waters\nTom ... says\nSpartacus you name it they're all in on it than just a resist and and yell and scream mob rule you know when I and I think it affects these people these these these these people like Paul Rosenfeld obviously took it took it a step further because he's in balance somewhere I mean this is not a a this is not the same thing to do\nBut I think the the victory all the anger the screaming the mobs from the left are going to push these people over the edge\nAnd it becomes very dangerous\nAnd has still hasn't been that long when we had a ... a U.S senator shot\nBy a Democrat no not from the party but just registered that just didn't like you know just showing his anger going to a baseball game baseball try outs and it was going to kill the Republicans thank goodness there were security available\nSo that um ... you know lived through it although badly wounded and uh they got out of there okay\nAh you know when I'm In\nI I and when I started seeing that I you know I texted professionals and talk to a little bit\nAnd um\nAnd of course I'd Edward guarantee who's been on the phone quite a bit international kind of investor guy and ah is recommendation is like ... says we're just seeing a lot of bought selling you know they're programmed\nSelling that so he thinks is um\nYou know everything's okay right now with um with the economy or with so what you're given given reasons we should hold on [noise] so um do you think right now is it a little bit of panic out there but uh you know for the professionals\nYou know there there are not selling necessarily been looking for bargains for people that might panic until all Gmail pick it up\nBut uh his recommendation to me was\n\nTo hold you know he doesn't see any reason to jump into this mess or whatever so I don't know just as you issue because it's down what five points for nine percent for the week that significant other significant but now down for the\nYear ... down you know since then since Trump took office for sure I mean we've got we've got a lot of growth so some of it as a panic at this point maybe unnecessarily\nAnd though he says don't don't buy into it told 'em don't panic bought selling botch role\nMarketing for his show a ... just reveals he dislike and now I surprised me because they both have a similar taste in politics similar taste in or what they how they want the country to run and all that but when Alec Baldwin went on his show\nNicole bears show he says the he thinks a dollar that are saving was trying to cycle analyze him\nBack in two thousand Seventeen\n'cause we're asked him since ... when when when you shut up on the show is sometimes you seem like an angry guy well of course he dies because it gets out on YouTube him yelling at a sister or being you know having a you know being drunk and stuff on YouTube and getting into his uh\nFights with paparazzi whatever it is ties angry he says but your handsome you're extremely talented you're wealthy what made you angry\nWell that sounds like Kobe I was just the way he is I don't think he's trying to cycle ally but I only got paranoid about he says I thought to myself oh no oh no let's not get cycle analyzing me because I don't think you're qualified that's what he's thinking\nAnd you've just reminded me in the brief is way why didn't do the show all those years\n\n'cause I don't know how to say this I don't want to get it wrong either because everything is a minefield of bombs going off but ever since I played Trump black people love me they love me\nSo weird guy Alec Baldwin\nNow because he plays he plays Trump on Saturday Night live as a parity you know to you know put Trump in a bad image obviously\nHe's a very liberal very left but now he says black people love me says everywhere I go black people go crazy I think it's because they are most afraid of Trump afraid of him\nHave you have you seen the economic gap turn for all of this race doesn't matter everybody every race has had a opportunity go crazy\nAnd uh Trump's actually popularity amongst the minorities is greatly increased now he's still he's still not in the ... you know he's still has overcome the Democrat popularity but and I don't know that you can I mean even when George Bush ran\nAnd say I I don't think he got single digits on black folk single digits that kind of that kind of separation single digits a Trump is up during the thirty seven percent popularity amongst a people of color now that's that's amazing difference\nBut um what they love Baldwin because he plays Trump in and tries humiliating wonderful\n[noise] uh Jeb Bush's ... news was not invited to Barbara surprise wedding now this is of\nCourse we know Barbara Bush scene is nice is nice jabs nice um this is the daughter of a George and Laura Bush George W and Laura Bush\nWhich is an interesting headline and you read the headline you say wow there's a fraction going on in the in the Bush family you know somehow jabs on the well that's not even if it's not\nThe case not again the cases it was a small wedding they just had immediate family ...\nFoot so a former former first lady Laura Bush said a failed presidential candidate failed to make the cut we'll see I I I I don't think she quoted that I don't I think that's what that was a I think that's the author that just came up with that because it barely they just had a small a small wedding like twenty people\nOutside wedding looking at the ocean and uh [laughter] it was a lot of family members but they pick out Jeb wasn't invited um and I just obviously just trying to get attention to the readers maybe ... maybe something's happening over the Bush camp\nBye to 'em and I just obviously just trying to get attention to the readers maybe ... maybe something's happening over the Bush camp yeah Barbara has small wedding and didn't invite all the family because uh\nI guess they decided to keep it to where they could fit everybody one table I like those by the way I wholeheartedly I wholeheartedly support that [noise] um RMC chairwoman run amok Daniel and we haven't heard a lot about her ...\nProbably pretty good because when we hear about Tom Perez on the Democratic side it salacious Lee F bombs are crazy stuff I'm supporting the mob rule thing from the Democrats\nBut Rona I'm\nWanting to talk about that talk about Eric Eric Holder's recent call to kick Republicans must not become the left new normal but we'll look it's too late\nEric Holder already said this is the new Democratic Party he said this is the Democratic party to kick 'em chicken when they go low we kick 'em\nAnd in fact he definitely in fact when Eric Holder said he was it was directly related to Michelle Obama in the face with Michelle Obama saying you may have heard when they go low we go high which is what which Michele just famously said just recently\nHe said no no no no that's not it they go low we kick 'em that's the new Democratic Party that's what a new Democrat Party is all about\nEric Holder well holders audience [noise] was a good cause them to start chanting fight fight fight well that's what they've been doing\nThat is what the antifa things all about ... people in the head with a stick if you don't agree with him\n\nThat it's it's been the mob rule from the ... and it's got its it's escalated to the point where responsible leaders are you thought were responsible leaders like Eric Holder have joined into the mob mentality\nAlong with Maxine Waters which had a mob mentality before President Trump was even inaugurated she was calling for impeachment Cory Booker same thing in the face of some congresspeople and that's a new attitude to get in the face attack I'm On a ... you know on the elevator\nAttack them in a restaurant like Ted Cruz don't let them eat or Sarah you know don't let them eat\nMaxine Waters don't don't let them to get gas to attack him and the gas station or the mob rule as a as I guess gain gain on it and it used to be\nYou know the little fringe groups would go out and do it now now it's mainstream mainstream liberal not just a fringe groups\nIt's a disaster for the Democratic party I mean they think they think when Eric Holder does does he doesn't think he's destroying anything he thinks he's building\nHe thinks he's cool you know coalescing and bringing them together and and and working to make them ... I mean he thinks that he has to he's not doing anything to he's not a he's not an operative for the currency is not an operative for the Republican so he's obviously misguided enough to think this is what we need to do is go public on what we've always thought\n\nAnd I think they misinterpret who Trump is a big because they see Trump they they they label Trump as as as racist and bigoted and and they look at his tweets and just go crazy because they don't like his policies so they think that's what he's doing all timed Trump is not like this this is not that he doesn't say kick them when they go low\n\nDoesn't say don't let them eat in these he doesn't become part of the mob doesn't support the mob rule he's he's definitely law and order and is he loose with the with his ah thoughts and tells you exactly what yeah that's fine he's never never encourage one time I see one time\nAli before he was ever president somebody was going crazy you know some operative was going crazy at one of his rallies and he said something to the effect\nIf you punch him or something I'll I'll cover your core cost something like that something they still use that to this day to show how what a horrible guy he is you know there was one guy that was causing a huge disruption and and and fighting with police officers\n\nNow we've got Eric Holder the attorney general former attorney general going public to the to the populous in general when they go low we kick them this is the new ... Democratic Party is all about and and you don't hear anything from the liberal\nPress saying this is al line when you hear from the aren't and see you heard from some other conservatives but you're not hearing it from the liberal press that went nuts on Trump that he said he said it was okay to start beating people up no it was one person that was out of control and and I think he was he was appealing to the crowd to help the police officers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Yuma", "day": "11"}
