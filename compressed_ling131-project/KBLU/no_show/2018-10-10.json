a very nice service it's very nice of them and that way you get your chance to a vote without a without worry so you can leave town if you need to and you haven't signed up for that mailing a Hillary\nClinton is still in the news and she is just she won't quit in her favorability is I think drops every time she talks but ah she now is talking about of course the victory all the crazy stuff that's been going on a which everyone sees and notices I guess\nAnd she says you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that was just yesterday\nOn CNN that's that's her sanctuary CNN that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house in order to Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing Republicans seem to recognize and respect his strength\nSo this is all orchestrated and designed by the Democrats the hate the protests screaming yelling making Neal attacking Ted Cruz in a restaurant\nThat this is dangerous stuff and when you have political leaders like Clinton and you know she's the most recent Democrat candidate for the United states a\nPresidency how there's an announcer embracing the fact that it's not civil and she says she can't be several you can be civil with the Republicans because we disagree with them\nThat's outrageous that that that is ... ... ... there's some good things about this though it's a good thing is that\nThe show in your hand she's talking about it's he's open about it she's honest about it\nThat this is intentional and everyone agrees with Maxine Waters agrees with it below sea agrees with Chuck Schumer she doesn't say all that but\nIt's obvious because they all talk the same tune Tom ... same thing it's about being out of control in President Trump's been mentioned in it that the Democrats are just completely insane\nScreaming yelling attacking heck we we got a guy now Jackson coast a Costco above a Democrat intern that's that's facing Twenty years in jail\nBecause he's ... he was he he worked as an unpaid intern although we find out that he actually was paid he was he was on some other kind of program\nFor Sheila Jackson Democrat out of Texas and\nInput personal information now and then threatened to people if you tell people I did it I'll put out health records in children's names and stuff that's what that's what politics has become to the left right now is when it all costs attack lie cheat\nWhatever you got to do and it's\nIt's um it's gotten to the point where it's scary it is scary uh and\nAnd not it's not going to let up anytime soon Maxine Waters won't let up Hillary Clinton's not going to let up there in bracing it and that's why we have the antifa type stuff and that's why we have some in this craziness going on and uh I think and even the dirty tricks from from Feinstein\nYou know talk to somebody that has a salacious allegation against Kevin ... and put it in her back pocket for three months until they they need that next car to delay\nPolitical reasons all political it was nothing to do about about this lady's accusation it was about how can we use this accusation for political reasons and wins the best time to let this information go\nYeah just real quick I just don't want it to a state of forget about\nObama yeah\nWhat about him specifically\nHe's an eight eight and other other individuals like like a Hillary and uh yeah water's another individual that's just a just in the Democrats about up\nCausing trouble [noise] he's got his own resistance program absolutely right he's a community organizer\nTurned resistance man after he got out of the presidency so in a anything they can do not to move anything forward put two to slow down delay and destroy whatever the Republicans are trying to do\nMost definitely you know that that you did a study say that you know it actually you know and um I remember that a while back I Would but I Will call if they had it for a wire stuff like that\nAnd uh they uh they don't have time to go to buy\nYou know just to be a little more uh uh you know like\nLike you know it's not impossible now you\nKnow ... we'll we'll looks to us was to police it was already shot\nBy that sniper they went after the Republican baseball team right in in in this kind of civil ... disruption and you got to the political leaders not calling for calm the political leaders calling for of course we can't be civil will that's when the craziest do something more crazy and step it up you know what it is dangerous\nOh yeah oh yeah and and and that's what they're what they're trying to accomplish\nAnd then it happened it yes and you know I'm just I'm just\nI'm I'm really\nHe was going to have to wait and see what's going to happen when the guy\nWe need to make sure he's reelected in twenty twenty [laughter] because yeah he's he's unique in the in the one that steps up and seems that his timing and just when I think stood trip you shouldn't have done that you find out it was brilliant and right now who's looking that Trump is look nothing but common presidential now for months\nOh yeah and and who's acting like lunatics all the Democrats all of them are still up\nDancing around like crazy people and me and then Trump looks at home and deliberate\nYeah yeah he he you know he's not really smart guy even though there's a idiots out there on TV uh talk shows and and then all of a late night shows and whatnot you know all of a calling him like a you know like on the ... and\nDon and whatnot like man you know ... real you know that that guy smart\nAnd and and here they have to be really you know but not to recognize that um all yeah most definitely\nHopefully and I'm praying that he wouldn't forget that he gets re elected yeah still I'm Still afraid of that you know what it what if what if he does and then watch next\nYou know we don't know half he's got more security detail around him and anybody on the planet right now so I'm I think he's safe which we just need to make sure he gets re elected appreciate the call that's\nDefinitely definitely I yeah I Would think you meant but\nI think it's safe to look Trump doesn't slow down Trump is out there doing um meetings after meetings and rallies in rallies he's doing rallies for different politicians I I don't know how much how many of them there aren't going to be more than one because he seems to be everywhere\nAnd he just did a a rally Lucy we didn't one\nI'm a just\nA kid named thing but it just didn't win Tuesday\n\n[noise] uh just I Can't even thing but it just didn't win Tuesday\n\nAnd when he was doing the rally\nOn Tuesday the crowd started screaming lock her up after you mentioned Dianne Feinstein\nWhich was kinda surprised he said Trump's as a about\nSenator Feinstein that's another beauty and they were screaming lock her up which of course dates back to ... which we knew the the thing that Hillary was doing in the combing covering for her as the FBI's will prosecute which is a lot of control\nOr which they normally do for Hillary's is and I think they're talking about Weinstein can you believe that and it's just according to Trump and they were saying look you\nKnow that's the worst body language in other words did she get\nA\nHundred percent no I don't want to get sued Ninety nine percent see now I get I can get that now I I I Can't get suit you say Ninety nine percent that she leads the letter\nAbout a mission for the once you hold her back pocket for three months or waiting until the white

blessed our core Trump or is that\nIs that okay Iowa I didn't have it on my list but thank you\nI Can't listen to his rally he thought he thought he would dressing I watch and he mentioned a football coach that was in the mask that everybody is crazy [laughter] ... shots Trump he goes no one tell them that\nI was in Nebraska [laughter]\nAnyway\nAnd our governor steak her name is Kim\nI tell you

beautiful day and you sound like Jean Schmidt may have ya you didn't even bring a bicycle that yet now I get on that side of the door\nOr take a look we'll take a look at all but the proposition for Lebanon that's just one that's good effect the city of humor that's correct you can't vote on it lets you live in city limits\nThat is correct right but we all look well Dr ... limits so fix your Roach that's correct [laughter] that's what I talked to last week about an hour I was jumping over here somebody called in and said something about it and and uh and I know the misconception money let the world's need work they do in the whole state\nTo state is not absolutely a rural Arizona the city of Yuma everywhere we go roads are a constant problem because we just haven't done a good job\nAs a state for quite a while and the city is look into you know like look we need to do some ourselves as a state's not going to fix it than the price we pay the pump is not going to take care of it and no one's going to justice no one's got the political courage to address\nBut for living not set up to to to build a new bike as we know like that it's just part of the repair repair so\nYou know and that's the main issue is that there's so many places in the in the curbs of the of the city and\nThat need repair and in the part I think it's really important as it were also affecting our tourism are businesses that have the potential of coming to you if we have a good appearance good concentrated effort of what our city's really all about we're going to do well and those people are going to come and they're going to enjoy their time in the comeback it makes a difference it does make a difference\nJeffrey Yes sir suck about costs for a little bit now we're talking and a half percent after that and that ... percent of course not everything we pay forest is taxable\nIt's her or we get close to that might we pay for food not taxable there's other services we pay for non taxable militia burn the thing that is taxable we have to send ... ... what's an average family going to be\nThat rush you're old enough to remember the half penny right ah no [laughter] gee probably going to the Eighteen hundreds so I think my grandmother had one happening so\nI'm In I'm In the numbers business I ran some numbers I said okay let's say the average human family spends two thousand dollars a month on taxable\nItems that's high that I think that's high already be eyeing my\nFour thousand they don't even know that would be a lot of computers and a lot of stuff a lot of good\nLot a lot of trips to the big boxes is is there you go so that have set effect on that family by doing that will be a hundred and twenty dollars\nFor a family spends a lot in two months as thirty cents a day which is in my opinion and well worth it to have the good rose that this can be\n... and and you've been on the committee you would you you're in favor of for love and you're in favor of moving forward with this\nI because I Want the roads don't like paying taxes but you know what I'd like to have a nice house so I have to be and I'm working here as frugal as anybody I Know that yeah\n[laughter] exactly so you don't spend the money then you don't have to exactly but but also it's a I think it's a public safety issue\nAnd yes and deal with their cars now wants to bring my good friend back in ... they could get get closer to them like ... and ... and she's taught told us about a couple of answers and she has them or would you turn around my ...\nTires and ran it can do that it didn't and you hit the curb no he was in the road and the roads [laughter] okay you know is an avenue was horrible\nFor potholes yes and um I travel that I'm frequently and um my daughter's last tier I lost the tires one was a brand new tire\nJack Shit on the day before seriously tore up the side wall then you must have hit the pants and pension finches yeah\nSo I'm just it's really fascinating and not only that you're trying to leave and Bob down the road and then boom you get one and it it ...\nIt it's it's doing more damage than just that all this stuff is obvious you actually have room to broker him\nAnd know it just it just a little scratches loved being in a um [noise] so um you know just with that that's a couple of thousand dollars right there\nI can pay a lot of taxes and have really nice ... channel on as opposed to I'm spending that money on on ...\nThe amount of damage that goes to the ball joints and all the moving parts are under the car and the shocks and all that big I mean the repair facilities around here like it because we saw a lot more suspension\n... you know and there's a lot of people in the community that can't afford to go and buy a new tire all the time that that have sent it's not like they're not going to notice that\nRight but they will notice um you know having to go shot eighty bucks a hundred bucks by a tire\nOr not pretty and and they don't even realize how much damage you're doing to your card a daily basis\nUntil it's time to put it on Iraq\nThat that's correct I mean there's there's a lot of studies show that a city that has bad roads cause an average family three hundred and fifty dollars plus an additional maintenance costs for those vehicles\nAre going to lie I think there was a bad road I think it's easy to have that much\nSo am I Am I in my serial you pay a hundred and twenty dollars in tax and have good roads or you have bad roads and pay three hundred and fifty dollars plus and maintenance costs in your vehicle no I'd rather pay the hundred and twenty dollars tax and has a good road was when when we try to encourage\nCommerce succumb to Yuma said humor and they pull off we don't put out a great welcome at well they get the airport and they drive down the road down Arizona avenues that that could just talked about there go or that moving our company here these are terrible roads work I go find another city\nTo build him little little things like that can make ... make a difference on them on bringing new people\nAnd here's a case that Ross is is that everybody that's using those roads are going to pay the tax so whether you see a resident and you go to your local store within singing limits you can pay the tax if you live in a county right and drive\nSomething that's one of the local stores\nYou're using the city road you're\nGoing to pay the tab or if you live in Montana and go to ... ... if you if you live in Phoenix and you're driving in San Diego and you forgot a swimsuit say you go to the local Wal Mart\nOr get whatever store and you drove on his city road you're going to pay that city tax it's not going to be that much but every little bit helps and we're going to improve in ...\nAny indication on on how fast that it would start making a difference to the observers that drive every day\nBecause it takes a little while yeah I mean it's ...\n... uh that's we're going to effect January one good so but I think with the input of money coming in I think the city wants to make this a priority and Kevin pretty fast I think we start seeing stuff from teeth out\nOf there were some indications of well why doesn't the city just transfer money that's being used it to all the parks directs the ball Dems you can't that money was actually locked into a fund or are those things you can't touch it there's nothing you can do right that was voted on a to do we have some beautiful parks beautiful stuff can't touch it move it\nUm and this would be the same it would be locked into roads only fund\nAnd it'll be the enterprise on memory and counting forty years ago I took accounting class for nonprofits governments I didn't pay attention yeah I didn't either but [laughter] but now I Do so\nBut but this is this is locked in money and then I you know safety auditors coming on and have fun and if they're not doing what they're supposed to do with it there's consequences to pay for it\nSo you're you're you're you're very much in favor of for them and how many people were on that that a committee\nOr six or seven of us\nSix or seven was the was it all pretty much a agreement that this was the right direction for six or seven\nExactly yeah I mean and we've got people from both parties men and women in either the industry public servants\nAnd that and I know it was you and gene

crises these what we eat and all that stuff doesn't affect personal choice but to give them the better information is gonna is it going to start working in the health ways well\nYou know this is again this is a very good news and a reality based point you brought up um we are healthier we have a\nAging population that is living longer than any other time in history um of our species and the fact that we are living longer the reality is we are going to have more chronic diseases that come with that link to blight so yeah\nSo what happens is we are living longer and because of that we get a little sick or over time and that means we have to pay those cost over time as well so it's a good news and bad news piece but here's where it's exciting for us\nI think it's not so much the length of time a person lives it's about the quality of life that they get to live while they're there right\nThe piece that this information and the transformation of health information technology actually supports the quality of life\nYou know one minute you're a ... I wrote the word friction was what does that mean to you rich yeah it's\nIt really is the best example I can give you is when you walk into any ATM\nWhether you're in the United states or if you walk into an ATM in Bulgaria and you put your card and you have immediate access to your personal financial information you can pull money out of it in whatever currency you happen to be in\nIt happens instantaneously it happens ...\nWe're trying to do the same thing and healthcare we're trying to connect our systems and the information so that it is seamless there is no friction in the system so that when you go to get the information you're looking for your clinician your nurse it happens that smoothly\nAnd do you feel do you feel that we've done a good job to date where we are right now considering the wheel and started nine years ago we in a good place for you\nWell for me as a change agent I'm always looking to the next level and the next corner with the hope that we can move faster and better but when you look at the end of the structure that has that been put in place especially here in the United states\nI feel we have a great foundation I Do do we have a long way to go of course but this is not something that has an end point this is like any technology and when you think back to the early iPhones if you would\nUm they looked amazing to us at the time and yet if I take an iPhone one and I look at an iPhone ten no there's no\nAnymore so I think we're on that journey um it's being prompted by an educated consumer that's to\nSo why did I have to come into a doctor's office in the first place um how do we take that actual information but yeah we're moving in the right direction um and then I don't think it'll ever be fast enough for any of it as it has gained a lot of speed ...\nHow long before we get a universal communications network throughout the entire country where everybody's on the system that's compatible and to communicate with each other\nYou know if I if I could predict that I Would probably be I'm On the stock market at this exact point\nWell that's the reason I'm asking them about the investment guy in something about him [laughter] yeah I I\nReally think in the next five years you will see a highly connected country that is friction allies and\nThe reason I say that Ross is we are headed towards I'm a real dividing point in the next three to five years the silver tsunami which is our aging population there's about eleven thousand others that are\nSixty five every day yeah we're getting higher and higher demand and frankly\nThere are not enough workers looked in the United states and globally right now there's about a gap of over seven million and we expect by twenty thirty five to be a gap of over Thirteen almost fourteen million workers missing food we need to have to take care of everyone\nSo we must must transform health and reinvented for patient at home in order to get the citizen patient and consumer in a place where they can receive care no matter where they are\nYeah but you're dealing with the Iraq receive government bureaucracy that is horrible and every time they want to fix it they write another book worth of rules and regulations and forms to fill out and it's just crazy what's going on or we'll mostly just I mean you can't control that you can only control the information\nWell we work very closely in the United states and globally from a him standpoint\nAnd our our hope is to have good regulations and there's a lot a lot being focused on from the security of information that you spoke about earlier and we talk you know all the way through to how does the information get use\nThere are three buckets for everyone to think about\nCan you can say goodbye because we're getting ready to leave or don't say goodbye ... role for all of the road for eleven ... and ... and I'll come back to answer more questions in the future if you like you got 'em and appreciate waves are having a stress we'll be back with the chamber John Curtis after this five sixty ...

partnership with the downtown bars and restaurants in the city of humor we are going to do a an iceberg drop\nSo alibi an iceberg lettuce were head of lettuce is is what this is true Yes sir\nI mean they fabricated head of lettuce [laughter]\nSo New Yorkers go they're they're both Rob yes which is a big lie to smear some sort of that so we're going to have\nAnd let me just tell you if you go Google that you'll find\nThat they're dropping a big potato they're dropping Pete they're dropping wrenches and mechanics burg and you\nHave to go with a drop in South Florida and just enjoy that one

restaurants will be donating a portion of their proceeds to some local nonprofits and so it's really going to be creative and a lot of fun and we hope everybody comes out\nYeah and we're talking with doing a couple of special things over at the brewery so there may or may not be a food fight on the back patio but\nMove a little bit later there's a little bit of a question mark it may or may not be a food for our hormones may but nobody backing from everything yet\nBut isn't the announcement this morning's paper about it in entertainment district that kind of changes the rude but for the bars restaurants on main street oh yeah town that's huge word on that for a long time\nEveryone's you know it's been something I think that's been on the minds of the city council and the the businesses downtown that's going to be nothing but a good thing I mean it turns us into something our terms of downtown area and it's something very much akin to what you'd see in Prescott like with the rope yet\nUm and I I don't think there's anybody complain about that you know you have a I don't know you haven't done it a ... you have retail you have restaurants or bars you have fun it's a it's a becomes a destination and that's the kind of things will put a place on that\nExactly almost ... more locals well yeah and it's great for visitors it's something that we can promote and ah yeah we're thrilled\nWell and it ties really well in with what the city's done between you know the you know palm small now you've got to pack in between you're seeing some of the infield also downtown really does meshed nicely with what they're doing over towards the palms and you know I think you're going to see that development to continue\nAnd ... with a new hotel downtown um I'm trying to push the city to create a parking lot between the new hotel and in the um the giants you roll courthouse you got the Burmese lands yeah if we make that a parking lot there would be awesome because again we have issues with parking that really helped downtown though tells everybody else so I find with issues with\nBarking it means there's people [laughter] aim in it and you're like you always finds the pony Disney [laughter] but I have full [laughter] that's how I feel a beer better hands right I Love it\nAnd then the the date of the door the young um parade downtown that led a parade\nFor a December eighth yep almost lost her up at six PM\nAnd we're going to go down fourth avenue do we ... we go down to ... street you know the fear is okay sort of same writers last year saying okay that was kind of interesting and fun because we got there is some houses and around about um the crowd at the roundabout\nWas mud yeah it is it's amazing there hasn't been Fifteen sixteen deep and even after Christian McConnell\nHe's building back there on the porch back there you know you're having a good holiday time but I mean it was a huge crowd at the turn in right in front of the boys again there's a mass of people down main street but right at that spot at around about was ... it was\nA mind blowing that people were out in droves that's a great time walking that parade is so much fun capitalists are from ... about half reserved at this point already but I can we can reserve the patio\nOr if you're calling quickly [laughter]\n'cause it's almost gone it and send in large ... dollars and the money's and things like that\nOr you I I'll I'll do it for ... [laughter] twice the price I give that a lot [laughter] I give them a lot\nAnd then as we prepare for winter visitors um we've got some things the typical things we have we got the farmers' market on a main street on Tuesdays starting in December\nAnd those sorts of things in the New York passed the iceberg lettuce drop for New Year's eve Linda\nWell we have a couple of things are some bike tours that we're going to be doing along the river and the industry bank to her and um I I knew a guy comes out and about\nNo sleep during the course meal at the oasis the first weekend of march there's

meeting the first day after made Owens only there's there's only three hundred and sixty five ... days left to form into\nYou start planting the year before for the next year instead who's kept him in that is your uh Dave Carvel the lucky man after midnight who gets to the gate more power to do their job oh they're going to get everybody learns\nThat ... just as a fabulous job and again um you can't find the hotel that we can pretty much it is it's really rock and roll the whole town is really bust very popular love it yeah um what else do you go\nThe hotel that we can pretty much if it's really rock and roll and the whole the whole town is really bus is very popular love it yeah\nUm what else are you going to have your whole menu of ... what do I have no just is going to happen or let's don't\nForget about the summit in Mali festival yes I dropped him off the air December fifteenth you can't have Christmas that Molly\nI heard that [laughter] that's true [laughter]\nThat places that it is just watching the entire main street of summer to shut down with all of the food is Oh absolutely spectacular thousands of people yeah yeah they do it\nRight I mean that borders of blasphemy but I've never been\nYeah you need to get out more [laughter] and I guess that walking is any money at least they're happy I get that a lot more time\nOf the most amazing tamales ever I mean you have the banana leave rap tamales you have dessert tamales you've got your gardens um they make all these go down really well\nHe always connects the beer this guy said you just heard about\nThat um but yeah I Know in every type of tomorrow imaginable\nChicken beef beans vegetable ... it's\nUnbelievable what some of the stuff so for those of us who've never done it sounds like just thousands and thousands of people you compared it to tomatoes as far as I was ...\nMile of Somali pirates on both sides of the street so you walk down the middle and you just ... you you've got a list of these to Mali vendors and it's hard to pick out where to go so it's look for the ones with the long lines but for the ones with the short length spending on hunger you are but for the one close enough to the beer garden or\nYou're not entertainment and just it's really going on all day bands good weather sun\nIn that produce the scholarships for ask you for your shoe okay good I didn't want to see the wrong school because there's you know the things happened is I I can\nSay is who but [laughter] that's supposed to be biased by us right\nNow but again it it's again it's paying it forward yet it's often kids get to college which is a I was ... and it helps local kids\nSo that's yes yeah well that's the important parts all get behind that neat\nUm and so is your parking trolleys is it is your parking as they got their figure it out 'cause no one's ever complained menu that job no one's ever complained about parking or traffic issues like that this is amazing to have that kind of ... people walk\nTo go into Mali [laughter] yeah and bigger and bigger yeah no there's I mean there's parking lots all of us on a summer in the park in the back streets you park around I mean it's it's not a far walk I mean half mile no big deal\nMaybe I finally got it figured out yeah I Do a really great job\nNice nice nice nice so I Want to I Want to kind of backtrack a little bit or their entry still being accepted for the door to young or whatever aid okay [noise] and I go to visit him or the Web site visit him a dot com\nOkay and is there a charge if I Want to have an injury you get to forty bucks forty bucks to have any chance man that's nothing it's nothing\nAnd it's a lot of fun it's a whole different perspective seeing it from being inside the brain and seeing all the people and then there's the perspective of being a spectator\nYeah um I think this year really for life or we're not going to be part of the parade I Want to I Want to be in the crowd to see it I've I've never seen it oh I've always been in it and I want to I Want to I Want to be in front of prison hill I think let me know\nThis is going to cost me I I well I'm I'm going to probably be inside bussing tables so [laughter] so busy you know I could pick a beer money I worked for one night bussing tables pick up some beer money [laughter] I can talk to Fox we might be able to get a job\nI've done that once a law on the home town or riding\nA bike parade this year celebrating you agriculture and so we've never done that before so wind\nThe big uh agriculture slip\nIn and you can make a connection with with your agriculture in the spirit of Christmas experiments together the abuses together I I I think there will be a fun fun fun theme looking forward to the ... to be there as well that should be pretty fun and then in front of his new\n... well ... it it it benefits all the restaurants I mean you know you've got people start putting their chairs out their eight nine in the morning so when we open up their literally already chairs lining the streets are and you know for those of us that have patios I I've been taking phone calls for reservations for about a month\nThat's impressive for you to get

black or anybody that's been on a nonprofit board knows how you know you sweat when\nThat happened in the ... and to show you know they come out and then\nThe last three days you're thinking oh this
