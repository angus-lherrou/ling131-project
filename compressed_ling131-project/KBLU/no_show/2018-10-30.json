State Farm agencies are sponsors for the ... thank you Cathy in fact you can go bigger personally choose your neighbor just go out there on the evidence be\nEight thirty when she gets into office and

you get that check doubted worthwhile even when they get the right\nStopped by yesterday check on my my granddaughter you I had those three long days\nLong for her because I think I wore out but I think it will be okay to give it a little while to recuperate but won't by sheer yesterday after the show you know that she was still asleep [laughter] she got a little while actually I think she's been looking for me I have to go out and find her see what's going on with her but\nShe's okay she thinks she's ready to go back and do it again give a little more rest I'll take her back for another three days\nThe a caravan of migrants coming up like all the Caribbean and and I don't know where that comes from caravans more like an invasion of migrants\nAre going to drop Trump's attention to them is is is continued he hasn't given up on it and he's not\nHe's not just going to passively see this thing happened when he's just a point or another\nSomebody comes across the board of they don't try to hide anymore it's not a matter of hide and seek can find and look and all that stuff or they just run right over to the for the first agent they got and say amnesty and they know that they'll get processed released a Trump's had\nThat uh you know he he's tired of that I guess\nAnd he says uh he says\nWhen they are captured we won't let them out we're not letting them out we're not catching were not releasing we're not letting them into this country\nAnd that's pretty store knows there's a lot of questions and I'm sure there'll be lawsuits flying everywhere from\nAh from the left but ah\nYou know mistreatment and you know separating kids which you know the there are working hard not to do or there are trying to prove that they're really the right kids and these are not captured or someone else's kids but they're going to do it working to keep them altogether\n\nBut in order to accomplish that about not letting them out there is not the capacity you know we ran out of capacity in Yuma or you know sometime ago or we have no capacity to hold anybody we've got some answers for that let me take a phone call you on the air\nIt's certainly like your wife or your interest in it for both scare them because of the class they had a baby ... in your clothes in their shoes I in good shape you know free yeah yeah\nYeah I I Believe this Danish five states ... orange during this thing it's like a fight against the United states on them countries [noise]\n[noise] yeah and I think\nThey're having 'em I mean it suggested that it might be Soros but I don't think they've got any definitive proof they know somebody has come from Venezuela but you're right I think that's been noticed a lot that these guys and it's mostly guys like eighty to Ninety percent military age men\nUm seem seem to be well taken care of a guy there\nYou know again art and I you know that's the thing of the strike began closes betting on it\nYeah [noise] yeah I Hope we up I'd like to find out where it's all coming from which would be nice but uh I think you'll find that some of these are leftist billionaires trying to cause disruptions to our country so it really is a a sponsored invasion and I appreciate the call\nAnd get him to write I'm a Trump is he's talking about these are going to let them in he said the administration would build tent cities\nWhich is what we see all over the world that that the United nations will put up for refugees why\nNot do the tent cities it's a lot more humane and just turned them loose on the streets and and until they're processed mainland and then once our process we know that eighty percent or better are going to be not given asylum because they don't qualify\nQualification for asylum is in um I Want to limit America that's not a qualification to take a phone call you on the air\nI get my act Enron make them more than I Am a\nI heard on a I'm finding that uh yeah it's a tough one to a ... threat than from one of\nThe way with a a flight of a of giving part in this country and automatically I mean hey\nYeah and oh I\nI I think that's a pretty good deal they're trying to get through\nI was a I was text that this morning 'cause I I didn't have it for my my show prep at all um but I'm\n... send that to me guarantee my my financial guy you know does who does like the follow the politics doesn't try to\nHe said it was total surprise to me but Trump says he can define the constitution in birthright citizenship\nWell that I Want to see where that goes man\nYeah and and also a on a ... or ... or [noise] or if you can really but uh\nAnyway that a lot of uh all immigrants are getting back to their home country and and I'm like a almost a thousand or a a flight for them\n[noise] I I knew I knew there were some that that apply to Mexico I'm In the southern states but most of them refused it because they don't want ... they don't want to make sure they want America They're not they're not they're not running from something they're running to something yeah and then I don't\nReally but uh but you've got to go through it legally\nYou know and and I agree with you you definitely should but in the past they have gotten away with not doing it legally and they're they're protected by sanctuary cities by leftist politicians Kirsten Sinema\nYou know who I just saw a tape of her this morning and said she thinks everybody and they come to the United states should be given citizenship unless they've done bad things\nYeah [laughter] I don't know that that thing and I don't know I don't know how bad you had a baby but she's pretty much open border [laughter] they present it get that you do but yeah I saw that a tape this morning and Christians sentiments about Fifteen minutes long on YouTube\nAnd it was it was sent to me and it's it's somebody an independent\nAgency goes round looks for those things but uh uh stamina talk more about that later and it's all current stuff it's not it's not even the old stuff you know from a few years ago which is from a few days ago uh stuff that her\nAnd her her for a\nCampaign mansion or are talking about uh getting back to these tent cities now\nI Would like to see them and it wouldn't take much to do them I mean United Nations correct those in a hurry\nSo I'm sure we can handle it with a tent cities and and what sorts of recognition\nOr just like I got just like the caller said which is a recognition that we're not going to be set free is as are counting on or there'll be given a you know you know shelter and everything in a temporary structure and and Trump's as you get a bill temporary structures are going to build permanent ones for a million dollars\nHe says we're going to put tense up all over the place we're not going to build a structures and spend hundreds of millions of dollars we're going to have tense we're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and they don't get asylum they get out\nWhich is true most most all of them because to qualify for asylum doesn't mean I'm I Lived in a bad neighborhood that doesn't mean I I Want to work in America\nThat somewhat asylum sold out and but yet it's been a it's been used as a as an injury tool to get to do is to a court date never show up or if they do show up and we're going to be granted asylum\nOr he's asking him easy says please go back you will not be admitted into the United states unless you go through the legal process this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you\nAnd that's one of the tweets and and the hard line is that\nUh and I think it's the proper hard line you know too much the message has been out there that these people that are recruiting say all you have to do is is a follow this gives gains land and you'll get entering the United states here's here's how you handle it and they need to ...\nFrom our leadership saying ain't gonna happen and we'll show it to you so they sent the um now is not going to be military troops on the on the ground these are on military support troops in combat troops\nAnd they're going to have a engineering baton a battalions with heavy equipment aviation medical personnel troops on active duty will carry weapons but not be part of law enforcement what good if they should be carrying weapons that's what they do their military\nSays and according to um general ... Sharma see as an air force general air force general ... which my son's here for so I got a soft spot for their first\nWill reinforce long priority points of injury so as to enhanced border patrols ability to harden and secure the border\nAnd that's where I just go during the ports of entry and they can handle that and let the border patrol go out in the desert and actually do the law enforcement work out in the desert which would be nice [noise] three major areas or south Texas Arizona California\n[noise]\n\n\nHey if I ... with State Farm agent ... major she would you do and

are like so like a phone call you're on the air\nAnd them on Iraq how we know we're doing well Karl morning\nOr good morning what I'm saying my front yard today and I'm looking at and the brand new re service road in front of my house in ...\nWhy do you have some kind of in with the city or something you got that done for years to do that to keep your quieter what\nNo no you know what I Do I guess what'd you do when I\nSee I'm Out here working at night they're all working real hard to make my play last night I woke up and\nSay thank you sir I really appreciate it getting taken care of my life streets I appreciate you come out here and gives Depp you're not getting around goofing off you're at you're out doing your job and not wasting my money\nThan I Do I think that's a nice thing man I thought I'm sure they do appreciate you probably got you probably got more tension and made sure that road was put down right there [laughter] and they didn't\nThey didn't they didn't even care they were doing their job\nI Know they they're then that's good to doing it yeah we're seeing a little bit of roadwork outdoor buddy\nYet you know and another thing you are you were talking about the people in Yemen are being taxed dang mhm now\nIt's our own fault that we let these people get away with not spending the money when they're sure because we all said at the house and watch TV and we don't make sure what they're doing it correctly\nSure the more the more you have to make them you know the more involvement we have as watchdogs the better the job that yet I guarantee you write that\nShow show me we can't really blame the politician we gotta blame ourselves here today and I ate like doing that\nI'm going to do both I'm of blame that politicians are time did do some times sometimes they're sometimes or um intentionally deceptive\nYes [laughter] yes well you're talking about Christians Jenna why am how'd you know well how'd you like a good again okay [laughter]\nThat you know what the reason I Know it because I open to page due to see what the hell was really going on\nI tell you what you need to do is go to YouTube there's a brand new video out there called daisy senator candidates simmer can't be talking about gun bans says Arizona or will actually shoot you announce a Fifteen minute commercial it's all current footage within the last few weeks of her campaign staff\nAnd her talking about how they really feel about things\nAnd why she's not being a progressive in er I'm\nIn her rhetoric which he's progressive in her thoughts in her voting record so take a look down and it'll make you angry this morning you won't feel so called\n... well I Want to come anyway 'cause it's not good for an officer\n[laughter] end with this and when his fourteenth amendment yeah\nI Do hope by Donald Trump to approach as if you are sneak if you are here illegally\nAnd you'll have a child and let the tax barrier of the United states pay for that baby and then you expect it to make that may be an American citizen and then at that moment he got a free ride on the taxpayer for the rest of us\nOh God of dealers that well it's a good deal for or somebody wants to sneak into the country all of a sudden but um it's been a ... it's it's been overwhelming to us it's been harmful to us in that we can handle the whole world jumping in there\nAnd ... and Kirsten see other than here\nIn LA though to cross the border anyplace you it is illegal to walk across the border I Know for myself back sure so anybody that step foot in the United states wrote the law that and\nThere are no a broke all the rules he has no rights at all easy criminal yep\nWe don't actively enforce it but um\nWell Donald ... gave me I President Trump's gonna do it\nI think he's been pushing a man he's kind of getting a well incensed for the rest of us I mean he's he's reacting to how the rest of us feel when I think it's kind of monies that he's listening\nSo how many they put in on the border if Obama's fault by executive order\nObama Obama did a lot of a of a ignoring\nLaw insane and you know saying we won't prosecute we're not going to do anything for two years and those kinds of things encouraged people and then it instantly every country south of the border knew it and they rushed us so\nThat wasn't right it is a stamp paid\nI don't I yes I think that you and I think it went from a rush to a stampede yep\nSo now we have to we have to have to put United States way of life and President Trump's hands because if he does not stop it my life has changed a lot yours as\nWell yeah and a ... and in many on the left or encouraging this invasion because they see voters and it's been we're going to turn into a whole socialistic country and that's what\nThe left once at all costs even if they have to you know have have you know millions of new voters coming across the border uh that's that's their game plan buddy\nAnd ... and send them as part of that and she's she just said recently just a real recently and during this campaign within the last few weeks that she thinks everybody in the country that hasn't done something really bad you become a citizen should be a citizen\nAnd we shouldn't have border walls\nYou know maybe we can get your crowd Democrat Gail to call up and you explained why we should vote for stand them\nWell you know you watch that video you'll hear a lot I'm Talking I'm like why she's acting the way she is right now because she can't come out she can't tell people she's pro choice she can't tell people she's anti gun\nShe's got to play centrist at least until she gets elected is that how that's how she yeah\nThat's our landscapes rules they're radical yeah it doesn't make any difference the ends justify the means\nAnd the and these aren't people just off the street this is like Michelle David send her campaign manager\nWell\nHe says we can't unless he says we lived there yeah oh well out of me a bit but there are telling naturally have a rather take care of a hundred\nBy by now they get a deal they'll uh they'll talk about it behind behind a you know way where they think they're away from the cameras and stuff just than just I've got a\nGot caught and her campaign manager said something like a you know once he's campaigning on good forever zone or whatever the F that means because she's playing centrist to get elected play centers to become powerful and that comes from her campaign\nBecause she's playing centrist to get elected play centers to become powerful and that goes from her campaign staff so they're okay with it I don't want to be too progressive because we have to capture the moderate votes\n\nSo they're they're actively cloak and dagger hiding who she is they say I'm for Arizona whatever the F that means\nAnd uh and Kirsten Sinema on their said uh you know we're talking about gun bans and talking to a journalist and say you said gun bans in Arizona they will actually shoot you\nEven though she's pro gun ban\nWhich you just can't say it right now she wants to get through the election trick a few modern voters and that that gives you something she's not and then she's in and we've got we've got a real patriots Martha McSally out there that is only saying who she is\nAnd a realities right in front of you with more of a mix Sally and she's the excellent choice if you like\nThe way the country's going [noise] with conservatism real conservatism not [noise] you know running to the center so we can be more progressive F were legit we'll be right back in five sixty

metropolitan a\n... you know there are a lot of people are confused about what ... what do you mean we're not a metropolitan but you're as executive director and you put this for two years now and we'll just go to your background but you know civil engineering up in Maricopa County for a couple of years and and uh transportation direct a director up there for twelve or something or\nNot it yeah I ... the Maricopa association against the same organization in the Phoenix area and and then some\nConsulting firms so you've been about roads for a long time then professionally trained as an engineer as well as a planning organizing making sure when they started wrote it went into the state and they finish and then they they they meet in the middle there on the same area\nStarted off it through some building roads did ya okay so they're\nSo and and so you can you come to ... to Yuma with a lot of experience and a lot of and and more importantly for me anyway not not just the experience but but the understanding of the state of Arizona the players and state of Arizona\nHow it works when you coordinate the federal and state I mean that's the power of the the Indian tribes and the counties and all the roads yeah we'll have to be working in the same direction or we we get a little confused\nAnd that's one of the reasons why uh metropolitan planning organizations are set up in the first place by the south so for anything to happen in the in the county view\nIt it goes through your office the planning um\nOregon on a regional level yeah OK lives on the on regional it ... and and hence the coordination all all the engineers\nThey meet was at once a month\nPretty much yeah once a month and and they and you just continuously make sure there's updates on where we are going where we are and uh on on roads what we're working on so that there's a constant coordination of fact check our ... will good didn't sound that sounds pretty easy\nYeah ... ... but but I'm a big part of the job is funding and funding has been where everybody wants to ... of course of course they because ... some of the\nProjects that we want to like like bridges are widening or areas that are congested be relieved of those were you know those are big ticket items in the in the in this big ticket items necessary is what we do and it's where we paid ...\nWear and tear on the system is greater because there are more miles sure exactly there there's a lot more miles on the on the roads and and but I think are taken as our technology increased the technology that goes into the the building of the roads are stronger than what they used to be I think\nThey're stronger if they're designed that way and that's been part of the problem and I know that the city of a human for example has been fighting is that uh some of the roads that bears that have taken over from the county and not please don't get me wrong I'm not jumping on the county in this case\nUm but some of the roads I've taken over and some of the roads that they've originally built themselves have been designed for the life\nUh for the life cycle for which there being put to so as a result that coming in and they're basically a road is being used\nUm that should have a six inches of aggregate base costs on the bottom and four inches of asphalt on the top and it's got two inches on on native soil for example some I'm obviously a road is not going to last\nLike and and you can't just we surface that you cannot just snap your fingers and gun that's ... that's got to be ... you got to dig that upstart over\nExactly and oddly enough that's like fourth avenue extension out here and that's in exactly the same thing that in that position it's up to the stage and that's not necessarily not saying that particular road was one that was like that ... but there's also another situation where if you put off the maintenance on a road for so long\nBasically I guess the stage where you just cannot repair it any more you have to totally take and maintenance is a lot cheaper exactly right\nBut if they break and we'll be right back 'cause we are talking money [laughter] joy in five sixty

planning organization and you've been out of two years from now you know everything and you get no more free breaks\nYour everyone out we were right here in charge and we know that [laughter] well\nAnd I and I like to talk about your background because your background or you you do you ever for understanding of our system works for understanding of what needs to be done and even though you're not a decision makers search for the entities because entities\nUltimately make the decisions when they do in coordination with humor metropolitan so you're coordinator\nI I'm an influence as where I'm from the point of view of I I have a good for you on the one thing I was able to do in the past two years is to take a look what the money has been where it's coming from and where it's going to as well so I can I can basically let our decision makers now what is happening you know I'm at the micro level so to speak so well\nAnd what has happened and what is happening is uber could could have done better in prior years as far as getting a percentage of money spent in the LA area shocker projects um had had we done I I don't know where we had the influenced or the abilities to demonstrate that\nActually well represented by the states as far as distributing the funds back to the county that we're paying taxes on trucks and uh\nAnd some of the one of the projects we looked at yes they did a great job with a video that showed a the the trip out to a what they call that the YPG five hundred\nYeah [laughter] do on a because early in the morning the thing\nIs bumper to bumper and two lanes and it's it's not it's not the best situation\nWhat do you got pushing ten thousand vehicles a day they're on a two lane road way right now I basically did some analysis or I had some of my stuff do some analysis and we found eight of the roadways in the state that have similar traffic volumes um an ... why isn't\nThis line of why isn't this roadway falling ready right I'm On the ... uh we haven't quite got to it well and and and maybe we need a lot of\nRepresentation are are are better stayed in our story or whatever and that's and that's what you're doing now and then and I can see that\nBuilding that impetus is is beginning to occur I'm Glad to say\nYeah I think goodness we just recently got that a bridge completed out there that was a wash out and out and they won't wash out again at least this last storm didn't wash it out\nCorrect so we're glad video of that as well yeah so so that's all good\nUh but you can do a better job mhm and of of just funding for state roads and and federal roads and those kinds of things ... than but that doesn't necessarily take care of all our needs because as we said\nThe the total funding for the country to total funding for the state is not adequate and that's why America open Pima we did some supplemental ... years ago yeah in order to keep them from from pop and tires and breaking suspensions on puddles yep and recently\nAnd I know you're not a political advocate you can't say one way or the other four eleven was designed and set up in order to to to bring us some relief in the city area in order to supplement and\nNow I can lead to flee advocate for pretty much anything you can't just that I don't okay [laughter] this is probably not appropriate I'm supposed to be for the region as a whole not for one particular sand but for looking at it from and from\nFrom your aspect is as a necessity or when you recognize ... I think you'd do you recognize that the city of Yuma like the rest of the state mhm they could use some additional help or we're just not going to catch up versions of rainfall for the moment\nI'm essentially you've got the um now you've I think though the numbers I came up with ... over eighty percent of the population of the state of Arizona\nHave a ... percent sales tax for transportation purchases in that particular region now the twist with that is that over and above the funding which comes from the state highway system in the vast majority of those funds are used for\n... town and or regional projects in the Phoenix metropolitan area obviously we're talking freeways and we're talking like rather than\nThere there's a concern in a few of the concerns I've heard about a passing a tax break for eleven mhm is that the state will then see that we've got some additional funds and they'll pull back some of the funds that are already given us mhm um have you seen any any history of that in Maricopa Pima\nOh not only you know how to beg your pardon not only yes but heck yes [laughter] um I I did it happen and oddly enough that's where I when I first started working with the uh the Maricopa association of governments we found\nThat that was occurring that was occurring at while they when they start off or when they started supplementing they ... they pulled back some of their funding and bearing in mind that the Phoenix areas or the Maricopa County sixty percent population of the state of Arizona\nYear life and then was um was ... ... ah they had another Twenty years um but ... then started taking money or should I say didn't dedicates as much money of the state discretionary funds that they had available to federal funds and that go over\nUm well basically ah ah the mega regions said yeah no that's not going to happen but the twist was was things were going along just fine until they realized it was happening okay and it was the analysis of what's going on and then more importantly kicking up the chain to the political masters and\nWith its its bumper to bumper yeah it's it's generally above the speed limit [laughter]\nAnd it's and they'll pass you in a heartbeat or were you in an old dark you know a dark dark out and bumper to bumper traffic and they'll pass you and I've been I've been amazed at times I mean there's some really good drivers is it's like being in a NASCAR race [laughter] but but fortunately there hasn't been a lot of incidents that I mean there's no ... there's no bicycles\nAre there's not a lot of stuff going on there are some some some some drivers out there that really have both hands on the wheel sure they're not calling in their heads are level with the ... what we should have\nA well yeah yeah the the whole point is is the road itself is that ... is ... is borderline inadequate from that point of view more importantly we should be receiving more resources\nOf the list wealth in this case I'll give a for instance the state of Arizona\nI'm up to several up to a few years ago regularly you received less in transportation funds then they put into the system for national ... at the national level however having said that even though we consistently received less by we put in\nMy understanding is that on a statewide level because we have so many government uh owned land\nWe actually received by the state level not for just for transportation but old federal funds we receive more federal funds back to the states and we actually go into the system to start with not what I don't know in ... county as part of the state of Arizona do we receive our fair share of\nYeah one of the nation I I can tell you I'll tell you during break we'll be right back in five sixty or\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]

mean I I certainly understand but give me an example of a loved emotion that you're not companionship or not but but\nAn enjoyment emotion a\nLot of these are all about just loving somebody it's really about loving here stop because the more that you love your now the more you're thinking of yourself but you're not demeaning yourself when you're not beating yourself up those are things that won't work in\nAny part of your life do simply loving that you're alive loving that you have a job loving that you have a car to drive your work loving that you have to lie to be you know it's it's\nAn and coming from a woman you might think love is the feminine thing but it\nWas out of ... that are great leaders met ... gone um you know Lincoln and our great leaders loved what they were doing it for the people you know so it's not a ... you know why she\nYou know why she feeling that's just kind of you know I Love everything it's a really strong feeling and when you love yourself you can really commit to your golf shot and that's what you want because if you have any fear or any doubt or any confusion\nThen your body react to that but if you are\nLoving where you are loving yourself loving that you get to play this game and committed to that it's such a stronger flights to\nPresent yourself to your shot to the game it's a it's a we're most you know beings and everything is done because of a motion so so many golfers are out there worrying about the outcome which is worry is a fear\nOf what's going to happen you don't even think about the outcome I mean the outcome is going to happen you are going to get a score but you have to\nAbout it you all you want to do is be present present your best self right now and the war will take care of itself as soon as we have a fear of what the future is going to be or you know I'm fearing that the past is going to happen again\nIt changes everything and such a negative light that we really trying at point eight a day positive stay in the moment and just do what you can do right now with what you have where you are and that's all you can really ask of yourself\nMhm yeah yeah ... but he lives a score to curb itself is\nI mean I think is very good information and the fact that you have to remember the old used to bowl as in the game of golf because that's how you keep score such ... huge huge district counter control it is\nIt just takes one time every time you swing the clubs and put in place\nAnd uh\nAnd your rights of fear of doubt I like to do that is the biggest number one concern\nOf every golf or not just amateurs but I think two reporters the doubt and should do that ... latest tiniest bit of dough creepy in your toast I mean\nYou're right that that the coolest thing is that if you become aware of what's your feeling and what you're thinking you could use the three R's the three R's are recognized what's your thinking if you don't like it remove it\nAnd replace it the replay thing of it is the most important part you have to be aware that I'm fearful you want to say I don't need that fear is not serving the I'm going to replace you with\nI'm so grateful to be here I can do that I Love this shot I could do that and you replace it with a self talk that could actually help you it's not a guarantee that the shots going to be pulled off but you certainly have a much better chance in that state\nOf mind mhm true your emissions image total ...\n... or I'm used to go see him when I could you know your your fabulous no one's easy says about positive uses positive thinking cannot make you accomplish anything uses positive thinking all I Want to do the\nYou know fight over the heavyweight boxer I'm going to lose something roles are thinking will do is make sure that you were better than you ever will be with negative thing ... always make you better\nRight exactly and that's the right frame\nIt's the right frame or read it takes training your thought to have to be trained as well as your visit\nThere are a million instructors out there that will do your physical skills\nI tend to do I do both I Am a a a you know I Will I owe shape your golf swing but the only way to shape your golf thing is to shake their mind first do you have to know when to think how to think and what to think in order to organize yourself\nTo be the best that you can be and that's about twice a day is is asking you to do it's asking you to\nAdopt point thinking we could have a plan duty or process and make it positive three the word and in the actual playing\nThe game but in point I also have three words which is a a deal\nWhere did it yourself into an allowing state which is where gratitude and ... do I trust that I can be in that allowing the I don't have to force that I don't have to try so hard I just have to present myself the best I can and then whatever happens\nAccept it and move on and you because you can't change which just tap\nYes that's very true and and once again we go back to a golfers biggest weakness what the previous shot oh\nThat's where they're all [laughter] that's what they're always concerned about or their niche toll yeah you know because I always doubled ... next to him and I hate them [laughter] and everything you want to get it in the middle of fair way or the other rules\nYou know it's like it's a you know you ... it's so true when when when you talk about this and then we'll play golf a but\nIt's also extremely true when we take about it we apply it to life and how we live our life or how we go about business or we go about communication or we go about trust\n'em and you know\nEvery once in a while you name it will just make your bristle you know and\nI Know I'm gonna get married his name on it all figured that out as I see\nYou know I was I was thinking about this last night and all this\nPolitical hatred that we are going\nUnder some there's some lively discussion said uh you know I shouldn't even more humid Chris men Lewinsky and we just ... oh man they love each other dispirited yeah [laughter] ah\nWell once again your understanding what you can control and what you can't control helps you in politics it helps you if you're doing it helps you it at your office\nIf you think that you could control something that's really uncontrollable it leads to frustration\nWell it's also it also leaves frustration with allows it to control you\n... minutes out of your control and that has no direct connection or correlation is all of a sudden control your emotions controlling your feelings are controlling the results and right you just need to observe it in it and accept it for what it is and leaves without that leave it there you know I write\nAnd allow people to be who they are going to be that person is doing the best job that they think that they can do might not agree with me but I'm going to allow them to be who they are and I'm going to work on may not on that\nRight now I'm In talk radio so I have people come up to me every day until they're true feelings and I have to accept [laughter] except for them [laughter] and believe me they're all over the board there there's no one can system

blows players up at the end of the tournament when they're when they realize all of a sudden it your arm in contention to win this thing and then we'll come off\nFor well there's also um a learning curve you know we have to learn to give up the recall we also understand that golf is golf and there are no guarantees for anything that is also the players like that Johnson who won the masters way back when there's so many ... days they don't know what they're doing\nYou know that that they're just doing it right he never hit a par\nFive into the whole ... years anyone the masters because he was doing the best he could do with\nWhere he was I did go to a classic about that would be ... ... ... and and sometimes I I Wonder\nAbout uh yeah I'll come back to that in a minute but I'm sure Joe was probably the best number five in the world\nI mean he he played well in Europe he never played well in the United states but he never played will that majors\nAnd one of the reasons was and this was shared\nYears and years ago by county that sure Joe had this little\nJust this little crack in his personality that she didn't feel he was good enough to be above the top ... filled to deploy comfortably inside the top ten but you just you didn't know if he could challenge\n... he felt that he could play comfortably inside the Trump chin but he just you didn't know ... to challenge tiger and if you could challenge fury can if you could challenge\nThat the number ones at the time and he doubted that and every time he got close that doubt crept into his mind self fulfilling exactly yeah exactly\nAnd I mean when you\nWhen you take this point eight attitude and you know you take well gosh if it may be a sure Joe just would have been able to apply that\nYou know eat up five majors now a or seven or eight because she didn't look what he just did it the Ryder Cup\nMhm I I thought he was the worst choice that debt captain could have made underwriter cup team and he goes seven or do eight no whatever it is I mean she has the most wins in Ryder Cup play of any player in history and yet because that's where he's comfortable\nHe's in Europe that's replays well that's where that's where he is he that's where he thrived in that environment it drives and ... he loves that environment but once\nAgain if we if we label ourselves if we label ourselves that's all we limit the golf is one of the interesting places of why because\nWe're we're extremely vulnerable word rate like all\nIt's that vulnerability that actually allow that to come out so true and\nWe label ourselves as oh I get that many to a player then that self fulfilling prophecy ... will happen you won't get out there right but you make yourself vulnerable and say anything is possible I'm going to show up and do my very bad at\nIt that are saying I'm a really good pot or or or I'm not very good from three feet\nThat all self fulfilling right so if you're going to say something to yourself as well paid affect your that you want\nTo go through that you do\n... have you come really good at this [laughter] speaking it'd be a really good at things Russia's reminded me is going to\nGrow as regular day so a Anglin we'll be right back or ... or\nJust choose you Myers this is a dessert shop was ...
