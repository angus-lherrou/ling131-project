the house ... murders were ah were houses burn wood times coal\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you've found outside the building\nShe know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nBigger print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had an ... when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax\nNo yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah\nThis is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties and we have an accent would pile outside our house and I I chopped\nA lot of work with him you know to a burning out\nYou know my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would tempt to fight over who's going to be chopping wood\nAnd and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house like we we did a lot of wood jumping then for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago and the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest village feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always\nHas a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts as whites head right that's what he describes it and and one of the least calm he is not going to be caught so\nYou know it will be at war with the cat up and to the wall and uh you know he tried to get brought him into the basement and ... how how the ... but he always tried to get himself away\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime book\nI I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six or which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... or multi autos is based there are a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThey are anyway the answer is no ... he absolutely was not try\nMany many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being hot he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out your base of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollar setting off the shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene he\nA lot of people were executed for that the uh so no he was he was very quite unusual extent yeah have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money ... the the the chosen disciplines um beg you mentioned let's go to Marie who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in um well I was calling because I I was kinda curious first of all how you got out talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um and\nHe was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed in an act\nAnd then that came to his wife and maybe a fan did that but it ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he lives right out and I feel I guess they have that same field workers would be blamed for back anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about if\nA person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be [noise] he was so far have gotten away with it and say well how do you find out about a person if he um\nYou know where that from but see I was just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he hangs she may have now like if you go in and\nWhat did you see that was just it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about the luxury of bothers me the uh and uh I Wish there was something that you take it helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case\nWe were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can ... if we can to Rachel and I were to sit out\nAnd solve a another series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it was just the way the crime set up the way the story set up that broke for us you know\nI'm again I'm Sorry but the Murray let's go to my ... in New York uh for a Bill James on coast to coast am\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to a ass\nYou're back in the satellite said we're a good luck with that Web\nLooking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm\nOver the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's\nOver the Internet [laughter] the first part\nIs now we have is that she would already faces at at hand\nAh people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a FBI profile of might might slash this guy out\nMuch for that I'm also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in the book and time into somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um\nWound up but not even going to trial but get name Lynch and the last part is uh I I you mentioned about the state of the police at this time at the turn at the century that saw the um [noise]\nI ... I recently read a book by um you\nKnow it and they see as it's called how I became white this is on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to always looking for fugitive\nBlack folk but stay off this flat thin as basically competing gangs basically street gangs with volunteer fire department\nThat had competing spite thin and ... and and I like income that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as sad that fall and then the police and I'll listen off air over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they\nAre I wrote about them in the book popular crime or the war in a there was a woman this gets back to poll there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in um New York yeah and I wanted to say can\nWe can forty five or thereabouts a poll poll fictionalized says the murder of Marie ... but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city so yeah I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nThe the hang on I'm going to put opinion because we're going to get back to ...\nAnd then the lynching piece which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police news the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up to ... Dennis Dave pleasing on\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... to watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie ... there's a lot of that that's a little stranded in there that's kinda cool but uh she left it because the question about what it Indiana modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI have it out and do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask\nThe uh uh John Douglas and modern of well known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it on a chart of how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organize a the a and and also he he um he said that\nRobert ... Kelly who was accused of murder as it was a really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized but also because it was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked her profile operated opinion I frankly wouldn't care\nUh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine so the book\nIs about innocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of the stories in a murder in Maine and Nineteen oh to a man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously and this was accused of the crime ...\nHe was just a a he was a a a mock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit he\nWas accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years or before a he became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually work work trying to free him and did free the governor of Maine eventually\nA grab it grab a full pardon to him on a on based on a ... on the actual innocence a buddy that happened after we spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like\nThat in this in the book it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened a lot of\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred\nThese crimes occurred in places didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it the er so it's not it's not really that the uh not really that connected to my book\n[noise] [noise] no no um but it just isn't illustration it in that movie of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting in to keep them\nUm and and um and by the way I think ... or ... indoors\nWhat you've done I think you'd see I don't think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they might help so it's a nice of you to say not really been there I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find them interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead and\nSay I'm I'm Glad to hear you back I called the calls\nThank you yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor master for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know ah I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad to seal the to bring it up in in law had him for that but\nAh yeah I I I think he needs to be lauded for that is out of their visor initial paid advisor for the Boston Red Sox now but he basically gave that to save all matters so his entire life\nAnd I and what is China than about my this or is it I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I\nI'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nAnd what's the broader point you think I'm missing\nI think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend\nOkay well it's not the only thing happen if I happen to ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my 'em up on\nThe average age you're saying that the game it's awfully nice\nBoy girl that McCain but uh\nI my both my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a project you can comment\nI understand that I understand why you wouldn't want to make it connects to what I just think that needs to be sad that he has a live Gen\nOur bags and he's very baseball more enjoyable to me\nThroughout my whole life and they have your ... or you know you know what I'm saying though but anyway the reason I call them is there anything that was a time of year like you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than boxing ring you are\nAnd then I was curious I started thinking about what was the border murders the exporters and if there's any connection to them\nTo see it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is a it could be connected to New Orleans packs murderers and and they answered that one is easy no they're absolutely the not connected to the New Orleans axe murderer the but the Lizzie Borden cases not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murders ... committed with a heavy AK ... in the middle of the night though is the board and murders committed with really a a hand the hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr I couldn't say that it you know an odd connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh uh the board and family\nAre on the night before they were murdered and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nSo that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and uh ... I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and\nAnd maybe speaks to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family it was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near ... no that was that the property that two inside cats\nUm and the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was you know what why would somebody going to the house\nAnd killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she still do inherent property which makes sense but it did it did give me a moment to where I was thinking about the early to go to a dentist is in New York and coast to coast am\nFor Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\n...\nIt's been a wonderful program ... thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed to have a list I'm\nAnd I'm Glad you're back I root for them to use them for years and I I Know your way through to the problems there are a little ...

where they return the whole like amusement park in order to know\nI I Would say I mean if you want to trace the history of this you'd probably have to go back to the presidential elections in Honduras which happened earlier this year they were hotly contested between two parties one which is a very pro America kind of a Honduran President Trump I'm Juan Orlando Hernandez is his name is the president's now\nAnd say there there's a greater struggle going on across Latin America between the forces of capitalism and the forces of socialism and so the other party and hunger is going to leave their party and they're actually funded and supported heavily by Venezuela\nYou know they lost and they didn't like that they lost so Denison in Lausanne\nEngines provoke a tourist into Honduras to start trouble and they started a lots of protests lost a lot of violence ah especially a political violence when you're walking off streets and burning tires and you know that sort of thing I'm under the guise of protests\nAnd these are the\nThis is the party that was also favored by him is Thirteen and the gangs down there so they they lost and they didn't like the the law so\nThis is sounding an awful what they started money millions encouraging\nPrivate sorry go ahead\nNo I I Am sorry for interrupting it just sounds awfully familiar to what we're experiencing here and so all these people are coming fleeing socialism and fleeing this uh you know there are one party is upset because they lost and they're coming to a country that wants to embrace socialism America\nThose of us in America that want to embrace socialism and war torn apart because one party's upset that they lost like what helped me out here and one of my neck\nThere there are some real similarities and what happened was\nThe opposition party started advertising hey we're gonna just leave him alone for us and they're going to go to America now they knew that that would do several things that would look bad for the president of on the rest of the current administration that it would make because\nAmericans tend to look at other countries as a whole unit so it would make a\nCouple of minutes ration likely cut funding to underestimate that's exactly what we're seeing 'em and and in in reality that's the wrong topic because it was not the current administration Honduras it was the uh opposition party that started this now as it gains steam on social media\nAnd in in the press down there a whole lot of people said you know what I haven't had a job for months my on my family is actually going hungry we hear a lot about the hardship and misery and suffering that his uh in in Venezuela right now\nBut we don't hear as much about the same kind of thing happening in Honduras but it absolutely is there is some real serious a dysfunction in in the way it is a Honduran of\nGovernment and and culture works a lot of that has to do these multinational ah terror organizations who are basically said my way or the highway or you know you you will do what we tell you or we will kill your whole family kind of thing there are so much of that happening down there\nThat a lot of these migrants said hey what do I got to lose it can't be worse going north\nAnd so they're joining the caravan and then have\nThe infrastructure starts to take ...\nTo support these people because she looked\nLot of people in the state I think that maybe these migrants are being paid by a somebody to join this scare them I don't really pay their payoff is when they get to the United states but they are being supported and and encouraged by elements of the ... of you know opposition party and also by\nAnd and encouraged by elements of the\n... of you know opposition party and also by luck elements from the United states that are funded by George Soros listening for that us the ah there's a bunch of Catholic aid organizations down here who are are helping these people\nBut you can't really blame them because these people are marching along in hundred plus degrees with their children and you just can't hardly it just breaks your heart to see it and so good people are coming out of the woodwork down here\nTo help them by giving some food or giving some water giving a place to stay giving transportation unfortunately what that's doing is it's making it so much easier for these people could come before that there are multiple more caravans behind this one that have already started that are planning to take advantage of the same infrastructure\n... so sure how you doing this damn it so the people that are in the front of that line would have been expect when they get to the uh the border were one of the things can happen\nWhen they watch CNN and um CNN has been running pretty much non stop what I Would call infomercials\nAre telling them exactly what to expect when they get there um and they know that up because Trump has been stymied by the acting us courts in Hawaii Maryland ah as far as you know putting executive orders in place that would stop this kind of thing that will put a stop to it like right now\nUm they know that as long as they can get their feet on the ground in the United states that they'll get process through ... illegal either I'm going to get don't get process will be given\nA court date for their asylum hearing likely two years in the future because that just overwhelm and then there'll be set free in the United states they know the\n... and CNN is telling them that and as a matter of fact you know they have ... I I keep Joe this article and see it in a bit of a\nNew feature about that says these cities are ready to welcome you when you get to the United states and gives them a list of sanctuary cities to go to see I think it's so these people know exactly what will happen\nI think that is so it's irresponsible because I think that then encourages people to put their\nTheir lives and their children's lives in danger by making this track there where you know some people are criticizing I've heard Geraldo Rivera criticized President Trump saying\nYou know this rhetoric about you will not be allowed no matter what you know the ... he says that is what the scary thing to Santa thing no I agree with that if they feel like there is little to no chance of making it\nMaybe they'll just put down roots where they are figure out some other way and I think that that strong messaging is important to saving lives in that way\nWell they these people look I'm\nDo are absolutely right that the only real answer to this problem is to build the stupid wall ...\nBecause look right and these people making en masse to Tijuana and they go to try to cross the border into the United states right they are going to be able to cross the border in the United states because it's the same thing will happen is what happened on the Guatemalan Mexican border right\nWe're Mexican troops were there right and they came walking up with their children with the women and children range was right it can walking up and say what are you going to do students right ahead of course they're not going to shoot him and so they just keep walking and there were some says we're going to send the military to the border I'm not sure what the military will deal with the border because\nAgain that's all the Democrats need is a Tiananmen Square\nRight image of a woman with a baby on her breast racing down a tank from Fort Bliss\nScratch need is a gentleman square right image of a woman with a baby on her breast racing down a tank from Fort Bliss yeah and the Democrats\nWin the day when everything okay that's what they're looking for that's what they're hoping for ... the only way to stop this thing from happening is build that wall so high so hard to get over that they go up there it's just not worth we've seen that to be the case and whenever we have put up a ...\nAnd it will be the case now the problem is these people at the record going will be in the United states by the election uh more or less and ah that that was the whole idea behind are having them start right now\nWell and the people that I've been hearing say you know what good is a wall going to do because they build huge tunnels underground and have subways under there but you know the cross the border these people are not\nUnderground ... these people are on the surface and a large secure wall would impact Andy impede uh these people from having a media false hope a false dream\nUm we're almost out of time but uh you know we didn't get a chance to even talk about uh the hurricane Michael\nUm situation in the aftermath of all of that I'm In just a couple of minutes can you can you give us any hope [laughter] about what's going on down there\nOr is that just a big mess as well\nIt's a big national all of the hurricanes I've been to that is probably about seven out of this and it's because of the scope and the scale of the damage there are so many trees down there so many houses blown away and stuff but you know we can we can recover from that ... it it will\nOf the people are already getting busy they're already recovered from it\nAll there are a lot of people who are absolutely devastated without a doubt but in the in the United states would have things called insurance we got this ... charities and and people this is the thing that's different okay would I go to disasters like that where else in the world you do not see people coming from outside the affected area to help their fellow\nMan at their old except they do it if they're part of an NGO or part of the government sets it in the United states you see people coming from as far away as California driving their own vehicles with their own gas money and their own uh equipment spending their own money to buy water and food\nFor the company to help their fellow man just because we're generous people and that's one of the great things about under\nDid that the Democrats love guns but only when they have the only ones that are being protected by the ... but when it comes to you and I haven't gone to us having the ability to protect ourselves that's when they become hypocrites and say well you guys should call the police\nYou know wait for them to show up and do their jobs but you know we should have gone we should have armed guards we should have\nArms properties and so forth imagine the outcry from the left or the Democrats if we ever you know put a sticker on the capital and said this is a gun free zones no guns allowed and there was no armed guards and personal bodyguards ... you know at the capital's and so forth are in Washington\nYeah like well how's that working for you is kinda where we'd end up so how did you had an injury to a as an Alexander ... into either hearing about it getting involved with it taking that next step because a lot of people go you know somebody should X Y or Z you actually step in and go on to somebody\nSo we were contacted by many of our members that live in the town and and and luckily this is a very rural kind of a you know read area of South Jersey where a lot of farmland and this is this is actually a become a tradition\nYou know in the area with a lot of people are being involved and guns opposed to like north Jersey people that they don't or you know there are New York city and so forth so we were contacted and they were having a special board of education meeting to this which they had to move\nTo a auditorium and another building because so many parents came out\nPosing what the school did a and ... and and for hours they were reprimand into school\nBoard or how the school handled the situation which was a breath of fresh air yes\nAnd there was I think two or three people that one of the women's I mentioned a former board of a a former education\nAdministrator that said we have to you know punished your kid to kick them out of school but Ninety eight percent\nOf the people that came to that school board of education meaning spoke out now of course they turned around and said oh no we support the second amendment we do that we do that\nOr the lawyers jumped into into lawyer thing you know whatever the case as I said okay if you guys are claiming that you're so pro gun that you are you know support the second amendment that suddenly all these guys are a Second Amendment supporters and enter a members\nWhy don't you guys prove it we're going to host a free day arranged for your high school students and we're going to take all of them to the gun range and we want you to endorse support it\nAnd one by one I went through the entire board of education all the board members you support this do you support gun safety will teach them what to do you ever see a ... you know common an eagle practices\nHow to properly and safely handle firearms and one by one I pick them off and they all agree this is a great idea which should be advocating for gun safety which should be\nUp early and safely handle firearms and one by one I pick them off and they all agreed this was a great idea we should be advocating for gun safety where should we advocating for proper and unsafe handling of firearm as we did as Americans throughout our our history\nThat is so absolutely fantastic\nTwo months later fast forward we ended up getting a range to donate their time donated the instructors donate the ammunition the gun rentals and so forth we had a large day was about a hundred you know a hundred people there are the all showed up\nI was a wonderful they are but the best part about it was one of the students was interviewed and the news and he said I always thought those were scary shooting guns with a lot of fun I had a great time and talked about you know the types of God you want to look into trying to buy now getting his plummet that up and of course\nBombs and I actually came forward and roads is this [laughter]\nTerrible article by there was nothing about safety it was all about teaching kids how to shoot guns and showing them that it's fun which hey shooting guns is ... it is fun you know and sorry being I'm Sorry yeah\nAnd be we've had we actually have in the Libyan they came from New Jersey from ground rules New Jersey that's actually a started because you went through the gun range with his father's friends as an FBI agent in high school wow you know so there's a competitive aspect of it as well mhm that's\nGoing through the going rate and you might be a really good shot and you could put the what's actually recall macaca competitive shooter one day\nAdult when I ended up flipping the narrative turning a negative a to a positive\nAnd now getting a bunch of high school kids either wanting to go back to the gun range wanted to go to a competitive shooting because one thing I advocated to them as a lot of college scholarships out there that nobody talks about ... but they can go to college for free ... they are competitive shooter involved in the competition sports\nAbsolutely and and we've got to run but what what people who aren't in the shooting sports or are familiar with guns don't they don't understand is that when kids are out on the range with their family first of all it's they're not having screen time with their phones right there with their family\nTheir learning discipline their learning focus their learning maturity they're learning follow through so many important things or you would think that every parent would would embrace that and and want to do more to or at least investigate the idea and nuts suspend straight a student for\nDoing that and then posting a picture on line it it there's craziness that I'm so thankful that there are people like you out there and an organization like Angie to a U.S out there you know helping like you said\nFlip the script I think put the ... where it should be in the first place that we've got to run thank you so much for spending Ted you're on your back on yeah as we go out to folks how they can find out more about what you're doing and support it this is a volunteer donation based organization how can they help support\nAbsolutely I N J to AS dot org I keep telling everybody from around the country don't let your state become like New Jersey we are behind enemy lines were fighting to fight here you've got to kill the snake by cutting it set off but never ever let your state become like New Jersey\nNear awesome and you can't be everywhere yourself right so we need more

mental health as it is it does it went into\nAnd um you know I I think I just kind of looked over to Mike and said you know because we started talking about how it's always the guns fall ... and the people shy are shying away from the mental health issue when we're finding out that most of these people that are committing these mass shootings are a lot of these crimes\nIt's been well known and well documented that they're they they could use help ... and people should you know they probably shouldn't have I had access to farms him but or put in it is from the beginning to help them and to kind of\nIt's not us versus them or ... what can I was like why are we contributing money towards\nTowards this and then Mike just took an absolutely ran with that and I just turned into you know in working with Rob Pincus and Mazen and started and all of this thing that's just spinning like a huge balls is it's just been incredible\nIt's awesome so what exactly I mean so you're investing time and money toward the idea of mental health and suicide prevention but like what are the nuts and bolts seven\nAnd you don't have to us more to do anything he believes in ... that's why he did it because he believes when you guys it's\nAwfully absolutely well I don't want us to run out of time without a giving you guys a chance to really kind of grow about all the different brands that\nNew admitted he arms we had Rob Pincus on just a couple of weeks ago talking about that gun and you know he is a guy and guy said he he speaks a little bit in you know the technical terminology\nSo we have one of each in here now we have a gang guy and then we had the ... guy so for for the people that want to know like you know what what all the technical information rather than why don't you talk about\n[noise] the the whole concept behind a video arms started gosh now it's been probably four years ago yeah if it feels like a lifetime ago but it also feels that just yesterday but we were I'm at a trade show in Texas\nIn my can I just worked had been throwing around along with you know\nI'm just had been thrown around let's let's do something on American Made on because everything we do is imported right yeah and without any knowledge of what it takes to make a gun or yeah\nI mean I Know it's just rich richer you were just for four years ago now yeah but\nYou know it was kind of like okay well we can just make a gun and and we don't know anything about it and\nAnd book let's make it special in the whole I I started thinking about like the tennis shoes or for snowboards and skate boards where you have these athletes endorsed products were has their signature on the idea of just sort of like a signature series of\nHandguns yeah a came to mind and it's a long immediately think of me\nI don't have a cat or whatever you're that Ford around your for your you know they have an accent\nSo we were like we we had a relationship with Rob already and so I said to them you know Hey Rob\nIs there a handgun out there that is\nOne hundred percent to what you want in a hand gun\nAnd he stopped and he thought about for a while and he said you actually know what there's parts of this that I like Al Gore is that hearts of this like parts of this are like and I said what would you like to make one\nAnd he's immediately yes so that's how the pie tin evolved which is personal defense ten round\nAnd so over the years again we've been talking about it and has been out there but it's just taken us a lot longer because we don't manufacture\nRight if it were a lawyer and the central oh no but we are very close and the idea behind it was to make the most conceivable\nFull size gun markets if I'm\nThere your some of your listeners probably familiar with that they've seen it out there and social media but it is less than an inch thick it holds then rounds of nine millimeter has a Nineteen eleven magazine\nAnd it's got a lot of really cool features is designed to fit everybody's handy when we come so hopefully it will be there you know hopefully sooner than later we're we're hoping early next\nYear if not if not sooner and I guess my ... my checkbook once you that you have to really have any data Eric yeah [laughter] and nothing else it's\nBeen a fun project it's been a learning experience and once we get this thing going it's gonna be pretty exciting he ever wrote a type of it yeah yeah yeah I mean we've got plenty of prototypes we've been shooting um we've been doing all kinds of testing and you know little by little we you know and and that's another thing you know\nGod Bless Rob he wants to seem to be it's got his backing and I know it was so he wants to sing to be exactly\nThe way he wanted to perform flawlessly right the ... we don't want one of those recalls we don't want yeah hey send it back to this other addicts this now where we don't want to you know they have oh this is the second evolution after six months\nGoing to be right and it's going to be great and it's going to do everything the way the ... design product should do things\nSo I absolutely love every single thing about that and including Mr on gun guy over there and Michael that you know I think sometimes there that's an advantage that\nYou know ... if you'd a bad guy and guy maybe you would have thought oh it'd be cool to do that but you know it's going to be too hard or it's going to be too big of a project or you know it's going to take for years and and you just kind of went in with I can do attitude and I love that\nYeah [laughter] I'm Joe you're a ...\nWe made some some critical errors I think it's a learning lesson a and want to say there's nothing really major but like we were kind of wanted to show the public like hey process from start to finish that we wanted we wanted to transfer\nDown yeah we want your hands out there and we don't really I Know you wish you'd get his\nPeople on line that kind of troll down and there's like gun doesn't exist guns ever coming out and it's like he Robert showing you every step of the ways you know ... ... ... so there's been a learning experience and then\nWhen the industry is great right like in the monies flowing uh it's easier to kind of do things when when he goes down unless you're getting somebody else to fund it like we sell funded this project that's all you know so and\nYou know the best part about it as anything else that I've ever seen out there that carried somebody's signature whether it be some sort of long range hunting rifle\nOr of a a pistol they've all been very very expensive super call some of the public's going to be able to bothers for under five hundred dollars\nWow so I Know that's it's going to be forever\nAs a retailer we definitely live at and at the U.S female who is always looking for a small slim easily concealed\nI Can't wait to to get one physically in my hand to to feel it and take it out on the range so were bad at a time that I just want to take a minute

dot com we'll give you the best value for use guns so stopping see my friends down and Sheryl taught\nThat easy firearms dot com in old town Avondale off the ... and ... road and tell them Joey rocket shoes doing sent you [noise]\nNot only is one of the hundred and Seventy six co sponsors\nOf the assault weapons ban HR fifty seven but he has gone he has done many interviews where he says I just don't believe that civilians ought to be able to possess an assault rifle or an A R Fifteen they're specifically made for killing human beings and they should not be allowed to have them\nSo he he definitely is a double talker he's a wolf in sheep's clothing or he says he supports the second amendment but then the second amendment to him I guess are single shot\nBoth action rifles and ... and all the second amendment protects or if it protects anything at all mhm so you know so here in Texas we have a very very clear choice between somebody who is pro gun and somebody who is anti gun and if folks\nIn their own respective states started digging around I think they will find stark contrast between people who are in contested races in their areas as well mhm and like I said I gotta do is go to the government the U.S Congress website and look up HR fifty eighty seven\nUh because you know like you said earlier a hundred and Seventy six current members of Congress who are Democrats\nHave signed on to say this piece of legislation is exactly what I Want to an act in the event that the Democrats take control of Congress\nYou know it wasn't that long ago that stance like that would be a basically a political career and er\nAnd now people are using it as a point of pride and and actual soundbite talking points and ... you know it we start every show when a quote by rented a president Ronald Reagan says our rights are only one generation away from extinction\nAnd that's an example of that how quickly people forget how quickly if if parents isn't talking to a child is and isn't talking to ten nephew um that that people just all they know is that the garbage soundbites that are coming at them from the television\nUm and now social media so yeah go ahead\nOh it was gonna say you're absolutely correct and you know that that quote from\nPresident Reagan is is no more apt than it is in this gun debate because the media and you know the folks who run you know the television talk shows and their politicians that they openly support like Beto O'Rourke\nA there they they are they're not they're not hiding it they're not they're trying to mislead you are but they're anti gun stance is very well known and like I said whenever I saw the news clip of below sea this week or last week coming out\nAnd saying that that when the Democrats take over which hopefully there were a lot but when the Democrats take over Congress that gun control is going to be their number one priority um it's it's really terrifying\nIt is and we really need to be a paying attention be informed get out there and making it\nFree single state across the the nation um because you know they're ... they want it to be their number one thing\nBut when you see the polls that I've been seeing you know the gun issue is you know probably third from the bottom of can\nA possible topics so it's interesting how the the other side the right to restrict yours are pushing this trying to make people care about it and trying to confuse them with these phrases like assault weapons uh\nIn in this band that they want to put out there we we've run out of time unfortunately but tell folks how they can follow the work you're doing\nIt they have questions about this HR fifty eighty seven um I Know you're also involved in the U.S law shield organization which is a great as like almost like a self defense insurance\nType of situation just tell folks how they can reach out to you and\nLearn it or US law shield is legal services company that is dedicated to a providing legal representation for

first and then ... seconds and how to get you on your way to a retirement that you desire I'm In the studio today with my co host Mr Brent Ender's Brent strep seatbelts and we're going to have conversations and this is going to be\nAnd for some people are difficult to ah to look in the mirror and acknowledge that when they're doing investing and they're struggling\nWith their investment decisions what actually causes it and for everybody oftentimes have to look in the mirror and understand that sometimes it's your own choices and biases and decisions that we make as human beings about all things not just investments that sometimes can bite us in the rear and that is true about managing your own assets as well\nYou know what's interesting about personal finance and investing when you think about the various disciplines and things that you have to study to become a more astute investor a lot of people wouldn't necessarily think that psychology\nIs one of them and that and we're going to talk about what we mean by that in today's show is all about market volatility and what's going to be really interesting about today show is we will be repeating it and we know that we will be repeating it and we're sharing that with you right now because\nEvery now and again Brent when the market experiences some of these hiccups\nWe need to be reminded of certain things and so that's going to be the focus of today's show and we'll discuss why studies suggest\nThat the average investor perform so poorly we'll discuss what you need to know during some of these volatile times in the market and we're going to share with you the eight rules for surviving\nA market downturn and Brent let's first of all start with what people need to know and I guess the real easy thing to share is we should expect this to happen right\nAbsolutely mark and when we say this or referencing to various market corrections there's been a lot of analysis and research done over the years in time and time again it has come up and then proven that market corrections happen they happen more frequently than I think some people even realize\nAnd I think what sometimes gets lost in the clutter of all the financial jargon is even in the midst of a year went over the course of the year the market might have generated some type of a positive return\nThere can be some pretty dramatic swings within that year and probably even more so and it's become more common place I Would say in the last ten to Fifteen Years or the volatility of the market tends to be more severe than say it was twenty or Thirty years ago things happen\nThings move pretty quickly and pretty dramatically so even in a year when the market perform okay during the midst of that time though there can be some pretty unsettling time's\nUp pretty wild ride it can cause very emotional reaction and behavior and I think you even a mark brought in today some stats about the history of how often does it correction take place of what is it typically look like and it happens a lot more often I think in my realizes yeah and and\nI think it really comes down to what your definition of correction is but for our conversation today when you look at\nA stock market down turn or just a little ... up of five percent the truth of the matter is when you look historically when you go back to the Nineteen twenties\nAnd you look at the S. and P. five hundred index which is a good representation of our stock market when you look at\nThe number of five percent corrections we're north of two hundred and when you look at the average time between those five percent corrections it's Seventy one trading days give or take about three and a half months three and a half so we should expect\nThis volatility that we're experiencing today we should expect that to happen every three and a half months so it shouldn't surprise anybody in this is why we're intentionally Brent with this show\nIntending to air this every now and again and maybe it might be something that we have the air every three and a half months based on that stat because we are going to experience\nUnderstand as an investor this is going\nTo happen right mark and part of understanding that is knowing that even though when you're in the midst of it you might not like it obviously and it certainly doesn't feel comfortable sometimes\nBut if you don't remember that for every two steps forward in the market we oftentimes take one step backwards if you don't remember that it gets pretty hard to hold your emotions in check and not do and not make some of the typical investor mistakes that are made on the market as volatile are going backwards\nAnd later in the show we're going to share with you ate rules for surviving they market downturn so you'll want to be sure to be with us here later in the show as a gift today from the show we're offering up a very important audio book that we\nProduced a little while back titled the Nineteen questions to ask a financial advisor this audio book sells\nOn Amazon for thirty dollars but today as a gift from the show you can get this absolutely positively\nFree of charge all you need to do is pick up the phone dial AAA Tripoli Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight eight eight eight nine five seven to simply live as your contact information and we will rush you out a complementary copy once again the name of this audio book is the Nineteen questions to ask\nA financial advisor this is a guide for making sure that you have the right advisor for you we walked through the important questions you should be getting the answer to so whether you have an advisor already or you're looking for one you want to know the questions to ask you more importantly the answers\nTo be looking for in Britain here's the interesting thing about today's investor and\nWhen you look at the history and when you look at some of the statistics there is a study that's published each and every year and we've reference this in the past on the show that conducted by a research firm by the name of del bar\nThe name of this study is the quantitative analysis of investor behavior on so long winded way of of saying how do investors screw things up and how badly do they screwed it up and then why so ... what are the key findings that this report year in and year out discovers ...\nThis particular a report was an analysis of a two thousand and fourteen so the two thousand Fifteen analysis won't be done in available for a few more months\nBut I'm sure will be sharing it later shows this is the twenty first year that the firm has done this so this is not new for them or new for us to look at it but I hear some of the key stats and every year the theme is pretty much the same it's bad it's just kind of to what degree a bad as when I say bad when I'm Talking about is\nThe difference between the average mutual fund investors returns\nVersus the average stock market indexes various returns and they compare that to so here's an example\nAnd twenty fourteen the average equity mutual fund investor so an individual investing in some type of an equity mutual funds stock fund underperform the S. and P. five hundred by a margin of just over eight percent doesn't eight percent a difference\nIn annual return that year for the average equity mutual fund investor versus the S. and P. five hundred\nIt was I think Thirteen point six percent versus five point fights and that's just one year and this has been happening year after year after year there's always these discrepancies between what the typical investor earns and what the or relative index that you should be comparing that mutual fund to Ernes and there's always a discrepancy\nYeah when you look at that here's here's one stat from this study that I always look at because from our perspective it's important to look at investing over the long term I mean a lot of people will share with you all this was my last year's return and they may be their chest if the return was grade or they may slumped down if the return was four but\nThey are really controlling your user experience and so when you type certain things in if you're looking to confirm your belief that the stock market's headed down to four thousand and and the guy or whatever it might be whatever crazy believe for or whatever that you might have all of a sudden\nGoogle starts to understand this and they are going to control your user experience you're going to start to see ads you're going to start to see certain articles you're going to start to see Google cater to\nYour certain bias and unfortunately all it does is it compounds the problem because it's just compounding that confirmation\nBias that we can have very marking on too quick tips for folks if this happens to try to help yourself not allow it to happen\nIf you're trying to do this on your own do some searches and research information taking the opposite stance on your example Marc to do a Google research say about a piece of property or property values\nGoogle your town your ZIP Code\nAnd then say you know our property values going down I mean try to find negative information or information the opposite of the stance that you've taken just to see it that way you kinda can measure you know the pros and cons on both sides and if that doesn't work for you honestly the best thing anyways is to find a neutral third party resource or person\nWho isn't necessarily married to either side of that kind of an equation to give you some unbiased third party and information to help you make a decision whether it was the right one of the wrong one\nAnother by us to be aware of when it comes to investing and this is something that goes beyond just investing but something known as an anchoring bias\nOr ah when it comes to investing and this is something that goes beyond just investing but something known as an anchoring bias and the idea here in the psychology behind this is we tend to anchor ourselves to certain numbers\nAnd the way that this works I'm gonna use my wonderful beautiful wife as an example of this\nAre you hoping that she's listening how we know that I'm not I was wondering to what I'm about to say but one she's guilty of this when she go shopping because\nShe'll see the retail price that was on a sweater of a hundred and twenty dollars and then there's this discount price of sixty five dollars and in her mind\nIt's a tremendous value because she mentally anchored to that retail price of a hundred and twenty and so she comes home and tells me of course how much she saved\nAnd it was originally or her term as oh it's normally a hundred and twenty but I got it for Seventy or whatever it might be well she'd anchored herself to that price\nWe see this happening in the stock market a lot rent we especially when we purchased a stock we've purchased XYZ stock for a hundred dollars\nAnd now it's gone down to Seventy four dollars we're\nKind of anchored to that hundred number mark another little twist on this that happens to people I kind of call this the devil that you know\nScenario which is you get anchored to certain things because you at least know what it is whether it's good or not sometimes doesn't matter so\nIt's the thought of that I might not be in a great situation where I'm at right now so if it's an investment decision or whatnot but to make a change it might get worse so it's this fear factor that kind of causes people to anchor on to something because they at least know what it is\nAnd you can see this even and silly things like people searching for hotels to stay out when they go out of town and they might find a hotel that's two hundred dollars a night and their spouse might find one a couple of blocks down the road that's a hundred a hundred and fifty dollars a night but\nThey go to the more expensive on because they know they're comfortable that they know what exit to get off and they know where to park\nThey know what the rooms are going to be like and there's that thought in their mind what's the other and so it's this weird at least I Know what I Know they anchor and last themselves on to things even maybe when they shouldn't\nIt comes to investing that the most important thing that you can do for yourself\nIs to have a discipline process to have a system\nIn place that you are using I mean if you are going to go the approach\nOf owning individual sucking my example earlier of a hundred dollars and then it drops down you need to have an unbiased on emotional approach\nTo evaluating whether or not it makes sense for you to continue owning that stock gr mutual fund or whatever it might be and that's the importance of having an advisor in the right advisor in your corner and that's\nReally what the second audio book bread that we published is all about it's titled the Nineteen questions\nTo ask a financial advisor this audio book it's a three to set it sells on Amazon for thirty dollars today you can get it absolutely at no cost\nTo you it's really a guide for making sure you have the right advisor for you if you want\nThis if you want us to send you out free copy of this audio book all you needed to pick up the phone give us a call AAA AAA Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight\nEight eight eight nine five seven to you can also requested by visiting our website at usa financial radio dot com and looking for the promo code right there on the home page you can bypass\nThat normal thirty dollar charge for that audio book on Amazon so it was about ... triple eight Ninety five Seventy two if you'd like to get connected with their local usa financial radio advisor you can also do so right there\nCom and punch in your ZIP Code and all of that person's contact information will be available to you rent there was a lot of other psychological reasons for people making poor decisions what to another one\nAnother one mark is what's called sunk costs which means people have paid a price for something either in terms of dollars or in time or maybe they've had a bad experience with something\nAnd that then therefore gets locked in and kind of overrides a future decision making process it's a quick example would be when you're little and you touch Japan the stove and you get burned\nMost people know don't do that again that doesn't mean that you don't go back into the kitchen and cook again\nCooking is okay it's just you got to remember to not touch the pan or use a ... pad so same with investing if you lost money once that doesn't mean you should never invest again you just need to maybe go about doing it differently and figure out what caused you to get burned and don't repeat it again\nYeah and it's really interesting because as humans we worry about the things that we've already lost and you know it's a natural tendency but be aware of that be aware of\nAny psychological groups that might be the holding onto certain decisions that you're making are preventing you from making certain decisions\nUh next than usa financial radio eight rules for surviving a little market volatility

here's Marc Mauer is when\nWe have been sharing with you some of our rules for surviving a bit of a market scare\nAnd we talked about rent the importance of\nUnderstanding your risk tolerance understanding more importantly what your risk score is and then looking at your wrist score and understanding where your portfolio fifth what your portfolios risk score is and making sure that those two things jive\nBut one of the other things that's really important especially if\nYou are nearing or you are already in retirement\nIt might be time for you to rethink your retirement income approach and one of the things that we talk about often on the show is a concept known as the assets cycle portfolio system and the entire intent behind the assets psycho Brent\nIs to try to structure your retirement income and try to think about your portfolio a little bit differently to buy yourself the time\nThat is needed so that the assets that you have that are allocated to the stock market you don't necessarily have to be worrying and spreading over each and every day mark\nSo important you know as we touched on very early in today's show when the market in general has a habit of correcting or having corrections of say five percent or more a few times during the course of the year on average a three and a half months roughly going back to the Nineteen twenties\nIt's going to go up and it's going to go down and if you can't stomach it and don't have your portfolio allocated right you're going to have a hard time getting through that without making probably bad choices which gets back to some of the investor behavior stuff we talked about earlier as well\nSo if you give yourself enough time in handle it appropriately that you shouldn't have to worry about\nThe market corrections a couple of times during the course of the year I mean everybody is going to get uncomfortable at some point if we experienced a significant downturn like at two thousand two thousand nine\nBut again if you've line to your portfolio up properly so that you don't need to be tapping into your equity accounts of your long term investment accounts for say ten or Fifteen Years\nBall or you can at least work your way through some of those significant dips in the market so what I mentioned on the last segment for the break their mark about it okay to have different investments inside of your portfolio having different risk or is this is basically an example of it so\nIf we're going to choose some kind of a guaranteed income producing investment vehicle and our portfolio say some type of an annuity\nWith a guaranteed income stream attached to it and maybe it will provide that income to somebody for five ten maybe Fifteen Years and you know what the numbers and you can plan on it\nAnd then if you also have other income sources coming into our Social Security and pensions and things of that or if you give yourself enough time with those guaranteed income sources\nNow you can get the time in the market on your side because most people off on the over the long haul the market usually performs pretty decently it's the short term fluctuations and if people try to time it or gas when to get in and out that's when they get in trouble if they would just get a plan stick tight with it\nLet the market do what it's going to do it's going to go up and it's going to go down but if you give yourself time it's it's shown that it does perform over a period of time\nHere's the thing everybody has heard the old adage by low so high and and everybody intuitively when you think about that sounds good than it sounds like what we should do\nBut some people in retirement it sounds to me that there's still this approach in the financial industry some people who have structure their income in such a way that they're selling off their equity investments to produce that retirement income\nThey aren't in a spot to be able to take advantage of that because maybe they're in a spot where if the market's down\nThey're forced to sell no matter what because that's the retirement income that's what they need and so they position themselves either way to be in a terrible spot when it comes to market downturn because they're reliant upon selling those equity investments and maybe they're selling them low", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show",
