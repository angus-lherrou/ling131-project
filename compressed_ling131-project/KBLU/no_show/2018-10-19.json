Serbia salt on foreign soil and nothing was done\nI mean it was legitimate it was you could feel it throughout the nation wrecked absolutely\nOkay so what are they is this order\nHow to Don or to be that should create this mass outrage on the same level I don't even know what this guy was reporting I've no idea why he was going to turn in Turkey\nWhy he was in the Saudi embassy you know what the national security what was going on at this needs national outrage\nI I think that's a a a great question and the great observation um I ... it's obviously some political you got to look around and see what the what's the political reasons for it or there's some people mad that Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia\nYou're able to um even some of our our senators are mad at Saudi Arabia think they're a little out of control um in in ... and obviously we know the murder if you were students were outrageous stupid crazy shouldn't happen\nOn a on a true but nothing compared yeah because he was right and because even happened to be or a\nGovernmental lied to us our own government lied and they got covered that because that was a a democratic government bronco bombing in Hillary Clinton and they had to be had to be covered up by Susan Rice\nWas this you know a reporter on earth thing some massive a story that would totally rock the United states in the world was asking you know was what what color to the crown prince socks are\nGoing on certainly have no indication that but there was an ongoing feud between the ground brands\nAnd him and he he he knew he was in danger he would not have gone back to Saudi Arabia but\nHe had to pick something up there at the embassy\nHe thought he was safe and I'm obviously not the case and\nHis girlfriend or a wife or whatever out in the parking out in the car waiting wait I'll be right back and ran in and they're not seen again so yeah it's er it's er end this thing but it shouldn't and got the national attention well I'm going to ask\nThis other question them um if if in America we don't call it murder until we actually have a legitimate evidence could this not be just kidnapping do we have a body\n[noise] ah my understanding is and and again we don't have a lot of details understanding is who he had um\nApple watch on that uh was recording at the time and the wife or girlfriend later found a recording in the cloud in the watch put it into the cloud and it was a apparently obvious to the audio naughty only a than it was not getting them\nWell then I Would have to also asked the question because I've heard counter that that is not possible\nWell again I don't know last a it's early and I'm\nSo there's there's a lot of stuff we don't know and we don't know why we should be outrage and we're being ... as you know apart over nothing a possible nothing and we have no so I'm trying to figure out why why people want the president to act decisively and with all force at all\nBut you know why because it is because nothing good could come from acting decisively nothing good could come from jumping to conclusions and they want nothing good to happened to President Trump and that's why 'cause they would be a lose lose for him to do something\nOh jumping to conclusions like Kevin married [laughter] like like very correct like Barry never would have jumped to Bush what do\nYou mean like the tops acted stupidly within his first terms\nYou know on an automatically condemning the cops in fact one to change the whole nation to a national police force because police officers are well trained\nOn how to handle berries friends\nYeah you know\nThe only observation I or whoever the next you know I don't care what part of their problem you know if they're not democratic but whoever the non Democratic president presidential nominating would have to have a checkered cap it off and the height of Trump I don't know we got\nIt [laughter] well I'll take I I like the the height of Trump I like the fact that he's not afraid he doesn't knock down he shows leadership he's got ground\nTweets you may not agree with that but his is is direction is pro pro America is directions make America great his direction is is a ... you know foreign ah ah diplomacy in working with countries to make things right\nIt's all great ah so you're right I Need to hide I Need that again I don't need a passive\nI'm president ever again we don't need it you know\nKevin never would have been put into the office Trump sat there and pointed out hypocrisy on that panel\nMost you're right and most presidents would have given up well this one's too hot let's go to a different a different person that's\nRight that's what we're used to seeing he wouldn't give up on Kavanaugh they didn't give up on Kavanaugh\nWhich shows me his loyalty to those yeah it's good character I Know people want to twist that oil but the loyalty of stopping you why do you walk down a spouse\nYou walked out and if you would like to utilize that

yeah [noise] I guess the\nConservative Republican because limp noodle spy and\nYeah and and I think I think President Obama had backbone on issues that he that was important to him\nYou know he did like open border stuff I mean he went to executive order to um increase the flow of immigrants coming across the border and he got Obamacare through me and all this stuff it was important to him to to socialize American he got that done foreign policy was in ... important to him red line wasn't important to him\nYou know he went on an apology tour not not on a tour to to in to increase fair trade it was an apology so yeah he had backbone in some areas it was just in making us more socialist not not a more real robust economy\n... and he had back in the wrong areas and appreciate the government\nAre taken aback by yeah he's he definitely had to\nPush on selective prosecution stuff like that [noise] they bet go Beto O'Rourke is the Democrat has been\nGetting a lot of news of running against Ted Cruz and a lot of hopefulness from the Democrats that they can unseat\nA I'm a very popular and and very strong Republican Senator Ted Cruz [noise] I I think he's double digits behind\nIn fact I'm I Know in Israel have looked at the polls he's double digits behind but people are amazing how how well he's doing like he's a big hope and he's you know good looking guy that that they are rallying behind he's in the press today\nSaying that he would vote for Trump's impeachment says there's enough evidence now\nWhen I read that lets me know he's behind in the polls he's desperate it's desperation\nJust he's just trying to be more outrageous trying to get that extra ten percent which is looting him\nSo it it looks like a looks like it's over for him but he says I Would like impeachment to be an indictment there's enough there to provide with the trial for a full vetting of the facts and make the best informed decision in the interest of the country in the future and somewhat impeachment is is is to say let's impeach him so we\nGo back and read it again let's take a phone call you on the air\nOr ... oh you're more than a that's ironic that the apple watch video that they are a\nJournalist yeah I'm not really works hand\nYou know I really enjoyed it it kind of laid out all the things they were done in this city and they were ain't talking about

having you know they edited doing better than they thought it was somewhat I understand that that'd be wrong on things like\nWell no that's what he's been he's been saying is that their initial

summer in the winter months and you know it's kind of spreading out a little bit more we're getting a lot more international visitors um which likes to come during the summer months\nAnd it's it's really um our um\nOur travel impact numbers are way up so we are the third largest industry and a ...\nRight and and I know some of it the they'll come down and stay for months with the winter visitors and the rhetoric that and the Canadian dollar has an effect one\nWay or the other if it gets stronger or weaker\nIt does not and right now it's good and and where we've already started seeing a the winter visitors coming back in ... and you'll see the license plates and\nOh yeah or they will buy the Walmart the other day and there so you know travel trailers and stuff because that's a stop off point to like get settled yet quite often they'll get here in the middle night they'll stop it won't work until the morning and then than it out to destinations right and stuff like that so your

and now they want to do really authentic smaller town\nUm they want to do educational ah things and\nThen of course with the agriculture or what else\nI mean military can we do military tours and um both military bases have been really great about uh you know letting us come on in\nA seat behind the scenes and\nThe agriculture community has just been great about I'm working with us to promote their industry and to promote Yuma\nI think they're smart about it do they have always been open to politicians to others to let them know what why and how they do things because they always are thinking ahead\nAnd making sure that everyone understands them before they get to Phoenix and started voting on things that may affect the agricultural community Frank with the same with their image with tourism and everything else have been wonderful yeah that they do that smart\nYeah it's a they've been great to work with and they are a\nAmazing it's so much more than what I learned about farming in school\n[laughter] and I think it's continuously to develop and change and they move with it when it comes down to save yourself in the state of it or or water water uh taking care of your producing more plants with less water right the constant\nIt's safe to yourself in the state of it or or water water uh taking care of your producing more plants with less water right they

and the wheat that's produced here that um goes out of the country and\nOh oh yes oh I'm In a lot of it does and brings a Congress right here back to to Yuma that's it tickles you you're still part of that oh yeah I mean the tourism but you you know what you about\nIt um you know your commerce it's about bringing money into the community oh it's about making a healthy community well we you know we\nWe recognize that whatever we do here to attract people is also good for the citizens that live here because it creates better quality of life and the tax dollars that were bringing don't use very many resources\nYou know uh it sound like a business that's here full time and so they come and they they enjoy and they spend their money and then they take off and so it's um it's actually Arizona's largest um export business is tourism\nAbsolutely now when when you you you you handle and work with the prison or you work with the uh\nUm\nThe parks and all that kind of cross Colorado River told

human investment group also I'm a partner at George Davis can morning George\n[noise] for Tom morning human Happy Friday out there\n\nWell this market is fun fun fun fun is that what you call them [laughter] a couple of weeks ago uh the numbers I don't know if you're a member on [laughter] I said hey if things ended today we have a pretty good return on the stock market for the whole year or\nSo the markets kinda dive back in the last week and a half two weeks right now the uh the Dow is up four percent or ... up eight in the ... up five\nSo we're still ahead of the game but they're almost ah two or three points higher over a week and a half ago\nI'm Still a lot of negative returns in the bond market and I know when we made with clients and that'll talking about performance you know the stock market is making a little bit of money\nBut the bond market has actually negative and I just wrote we'd some numbers so years I can listen to you a basically a government bond funds are down about two percent\nOr a\nCorporate bond funds are down a about two percent I'm intermediate government bond funds are down about one percent but kind of across the board on bond is pretty much negative\nMhm and a lot of people ah don't understand but as interest rates go up and the fed raises rates three times last year twice this year they're claiming to do it again maybe in November but as interest rates go up the price of bonds actually go down and people don't realize the stock market change every day but they don't pay much attention but there's also the bond market\nUm so that's having an impact on you know especially retired people 'cause people that are safer probably have bonds more than equities I'm so that that kind of feeling the pinch also\nIn some of the talk out there Tom is it the bond market is going to start to improve it even those numbers are better than a couple of weeks ago even though they're still negative\nBut earlier in the year go to mark is doing well and the alternative would be to park your money in cash if you wanted to maybe take some off the table twenty twenty five percent\nBut you know you're getting next to zero percent interest now with rates going up a little bit you can\nYou know moving some bond fund some fixed income and while you're waiting and have something that Dr powder cash you can earn you know two two and a half maybe even three percent now so with cameras well or bonds you know instead of just sitting in gas or some alternatives now\nWith rates going up where you can actually get a little bit of income yeah and I have some time on the sidelines so they're thinking that rotation the bonds will start\nBonds are definitely looking better than were they were six months a year ago but ultimately\nI think it depends on the fed because of the Fed's show on on a mission to increase raids ... probably about halfway through because they're going to increase rates for like three four years right and we're going up on two years but that's a big unknown and that's actually why there's a lot of volatility in the stock market because\nUh you might have heard a Trump kind of town that they have to think in the feds kinda damp bring the economy because they keep raising the rates right so uh\nThat's that's the the unknown is different ... and when the market's been volatile but I think one of them is\nThey shouldn't ... keep increasing raids three times over the next maybe you're too\nModerate you know modern interest rate increases much better than the alternative and they got to keep you know the inflationary signals there's nothing really yet there was a few out there but that's hyper inflation or if inflation starts to get away from us that's you know much more damaging than you know just a steady nice interest rate hike\nOr where the biggest thing that causes inflation in the U.S are consumed Americans buying stuff\nSo the American uh consumption and there's about Seventy five eighty percent of the GDP number\nBut what leads to Americans buying stuff our jobs and if the job market is high like it is I think we're an all time low for unemployment unemployment um then you know inflation will follow because people will work make money spend money\nThat want to talk to the bond market a lot of people don't pay much attention to it but the president bond market is forty two trillion dollars is what the us bond market is that's how much are the people you know if you added up all the bonds are out there it's ... trillion um if you add up all the stock market the u._s. stock market\nI Know you don't know the answer but I'll put you on the spot where do you think that's at\nThirty one thirty two trillion ah\nSo the bottom of the last because you are trying to [laughter] I guess\nThe bond markets about you know ten trillion more than the stock market sure and the bond market trades everyday but people just don't pay attention to it right so that's a\nWell which makes sense I mean the you know people forget you know the market does well in last year we had a great year people forget about bonds and but there's a lot of baby boomers people are living longer and they need that income and you know if this thing falls out of bed and we have a correction and the bonds or\nYeah you'd think so well for my mother in law's a hundred percent of her you know retirement income and unfortunately that's the way it works for people but like you were talking about in the financial planning process it's a big piece of the puzzle and people get\nI mean I don't know how many times I hear Ross but people get you know excited about soon as I hit sixty two which is the age that you can take it and of course is to reduce benefits but they they think Social Security is not going to be there all kinds of different things I ... I got some rabbit right away\nI got some stats on that since you're talking about that so this is for men uh forty two percent of the people takes Austria sixty two wow man or both or the militias forty eight\nSo I have a ... a forty two in forty eight oh okay that's about half give or take right now the Adams and men's actually a lower percent a little surprised at that one well my guess is are probably still working those provisions if you take Social Security at sixty two\nYou take a twenty five percent haircut on on the amount weather then if you took it at sixty six are full retirement age our life\nYeah but does it but but the other problem we end this people do this all the time is they take Social Security is sixty to thinking I use the money but if they continue to work this year or two thousand Nineteen if you make more than Seventeen thousand dollars they keep half of the Social Security\nSo a lot of times people do it thinking they're going to get more money and then they get their first check and they call us and say hey my uh you know nine out of it on Social Security checks now about four fifty well do you really don't want to take Social Security unless you stop working really Social Security\nUm but uh the at age sixty five or sixty six which is kind of normal retirement age it depends on when you were born as full retirement age of thirty four percent of the men take it and twenty seven percent of women\nAnd then people that make it to eight Seventy and that's the maximum payout for Social Security hundred and thirty two percent\nWhen you want to explain that a hundred and thirty two percent since you do that through [laughter] well if you\nLet's say sixty six is your full retirement age and that's you're going to get that and that's a hundred percent of your PI they call it primary insurance amount which has calculated by the Social Security if you wait to age sixty seven it goes up eight percent every year that you wait\nSo instead of a hundred and if you don't failures times eight percent is for years and I actually had thirty two percent so if you wait until Seventy then you'll be getting one hundred and thirty two percent of what you'd have been entitled to sixty six for the rest of your life\nBut now we can start 'til Seventy but I'm going to add a little little spin on that I write about the thirty two percent that or you don't take into consideration is the amount that Social Security goes up a historically Social Security goes up about one and a half percent a year\nFor two thousand Nineteen you know they they changed the index every year or the cause of inflation\nTwo thousand Nineteen is going to go up to ... percent so let's just say one of one and a half percent over four years math guy Georgia's extra ten percent mhm so really you're probably going to get between a hundred and thirty two to a hundred and forty two percent more money\nDirect which is a big deal because like your your uh your step mom I don't know when she's step mom your mother [laughter] I don't know when she started taking Social Security but if she would have waited to Seventy to have an extra forty five percent more money\nIs the difference between having a good time and staying home right\nRight right absolutely so well since you're asking she actually took a sixty two\n[laughter] I'm job George [laughter]\nAnd I I Will get into a why you would do that with health and no other income and stuff like that later but that's got a reason for that so that was\nSo let's get back to the numbers so if you take it a sixty two which is in the early she can take besides disability um you'd get a twenty five percent discount and your check\nNow what you've done a discount that sounds like you're getting a good bargain twenty five percent and reduction auction negative negative in your uh yeah you know what payments for life now what people don't understand\nAbout that is let's just say you get a dollar you take it early Ninety Seventy five cents uh-huh but that Seventy five cents as your base so when they start getting the increase of Social Security of like one and a half percent a year or two pointing like ... it really has a compounding effect on that number\nIf you take it at age sixty three then you get a twenty percent discount at age sixty four is about uh Thirteen percent discount\nAnd then at age sixty five depending on if\nIf if you're not if that's not to retire made just about six percent\nAnd then at age sixty six you get the full amount correct that's all based on when you were born that's the other thing sort of give me an idea if you're born before age Nineteen fifty for the new retirement age of sixty six years of age\nAnd then it goes up two months every year or so ... you're born in Nineteen fifty five sixty six and two months Nineteen fifty six is sixty six and four months\nFifty seven is Nineteen sixty six and six months so basically it steps up and then and then after the age of Nineteen sixty it's basically sixty seven percent\nSo what do you fall on the chart was what were you born when you're born in fifty seven okay so you're a sixty six and six months\nI'm not going to be a it's not just six months or six years\n[laughter] no no no but I'm just oh you do your and my reason to have full retiring yeah as I said I Want to but I won't be\nTaking a\nI I mean I Do not see me ever retiring so six I'll still be working in sixty sixty six and six months now but he's a good chance to take it oh yeah well you can wait to Seventy and I'll probably wait till I'm seven and I'm not I'm like I'm like Donald Trump I slept on things to do you know he's still running for president at Seventy two I'm sure he's not on Social Security ...\nOne of those fortunate ones that can donate your Social Security that someone else\nYeah you're going out and eat it [laughter] I could tell you that [laughter] the I'm\nSorry I find that interesting time because we're in that window that six you know the ... the two months that they're adding on\nYou know the guy from two months it for months and people are getting into that window where you know that's going to be important\nSo the average forty sixty two thousand seven sixteen 'cause this is the number I have the average Social Security check was Thirteen hundred and forty four dollars\nA month a month for the average person\nI'm the most she can down if you have the number on that George isn't the most that they can take is like a do should be thirty or six thirty four hundred\nOr so yeah if you really max and max out 'cause I'll look it up for you but\nHere's the other thing in two thousand sixteen or the or or no two thousand Eighteen five point five million people were were drawing of\nSocial Security well she's me five point five million people were issued Social Security number as soon as I get a low number they do that at birth now this seems to be more than five million people being linked isn't enough\nYou're talking about a one year at the [laughter]\nYou got to you've got a phone call you're on the air [laughter]\nMore than Martin Morning jar than I thought hey good how are you doing quite\nI already and uh\nAnd I feel so\nOh up here to go back and I take fifty dollars out and go over there with your guy\nOr you can ... it all but you can't you still working are you getting any W chewing gum yeah\nSo yeah so basically what you could do is um and then we ask one other question your age how old are you\nOK I'm pick a sixty four I'm gonna be sixty five I worked out OK yeah you might\nWork sixty or Seventy yet and I draw for security but I still work and I take it out of my\nUh haven't taken out of my checking account for that ...\n... ... so the question is if you you can do it right now you can do an area Ross because you're still working Wu income and you're you can put money in 'em but once you get rides eight Seventy um\nThere's a rule I don't know if you know the rule George I'm I'm thinking uh you you can't do what you can still do a raw you can't you can't the government just afraid you're gonna put it in Iran continue deduct so you can do in Iraq after eight Seventy where you can do ... do the RMC Seventy now okay you don't have to it from a rock\nYeah so you can find a Ross with some of the money but um but that after eight Seventy an Iraqi or you can't put money away\nOkay but Iran has a pretty good because you're working the answer's yes what you're saying you can do it yeah already\nAre you on hold on a second look I'm going to ask you are you in that realm there were since you took it early you're making over the threshold of Seventeen were there with holding a dollar for every do\nNo I haven't taken it oh you have not OK okay no no that's out there and I'm waiting\nThat's good you know we have a we have a a Social Security early on Social Security analysts in her office that basically plugs and all your numbers if you're married we plug in the spouse numbers have you done that yet and my wife is\nA habit\nThat I wouldn't recommend you do that because that's that's what they do is they turned out what what's one of the most beneficial for you to pull your Social Security I'm so I'm call her office in states say you want to Social Security analysis and then we'll get your data and we'll sit down with you but I I Would definitely do that\nOkay you pause when you're up oh OK thanks a lot again by\nWell that's a good question a lot like I said a lot of people don't analyze Social Security enough and to me it's one of those things that's really overlooked wouldn't take a break here this was many talk five or six am\nThe in the uh anyways she was drawing Social Security on him because she didn't have much and after ... after you use your spouse dies\nYou have the choice to either continue taking your Social Security well you can take the deceased spouse whatever's higher is what you want to thank for so she was taking the deceased spouse is one and I said well you weren't married before she even though yeah I don't like to remember when I was married more than ten years yeah so I said well look at look at that person in a you know she was\nThirty five years forty years after she marry this person and ... and I will ... you know what he's doing is like yeah he's a\nShrewd business guy kinda like so basically his numbers were a lot higher than the deceased a second husband ... basically I said well you need to look at that so she because she's not married anymore she can actually dropped back\nOn the ... the first ones have been right doesn't affect him it doesn't hurt anything and he doesn't need to know right he doesn't even know like you know he doesn't need to know that the ... thank you car\n[laughter] I'm sure that happens [laughter]\nI'm sure they're in such enough that they can tell them at Christmas Time yeah [laughter] no the other interesting thing Tom is let's say that first husband\nWas married got remarried for ten years or more and then had a second you know divorce will that\nDivorce spouse can take is also as it can be more than one person taking off of his Social Security yeah as long as they are married you know if you got to call gentleman you're on the air who got talking about this morning we're foreigners yeah you\nKnow they are in the morning of\nCourse uh the earliest parts of the I'm sixty five hiring retiring uh-huh and I wear\nA cast of course the early ... or the ...\nSo you're just repeat the question so I Know you got it you're thinking about taking it on sixty five and you presently have cancer so you're thinking about\nWhat is the best time to take it yeah I'm\n... so you're full how far away you from your full retirement age when you can take a hundred percent you're pretty close right\nYeah okay like a couple of months or six months or ...\n... okay several hours you're six you have a I mean the question to ask if you are in my office is a cancer pretty non aggressive cancer or is it a pretty aggressive cancer\nIt right now there are I just think that you know and it is paid off but the worst part about that is if they don't want to start now\nSo close to that date it's not going to make a big difference on your on your number\nBecause if you waited till you're um say one year before the full retirement age it's about six percent discount but now that you only four months or maybe five months away you're probably talking only as two or three four percent difference\nSo I Want to have a problem if you want to take it right away just to get the clock going with him he's also still\nWorking though so below full retirement age they'll withhold a dollar for every two if he's making over that amount that's the only other thing to be careful as\nOh yeah so you're you're ... you're still working making more than Seventeen thousand dollars yeah\nOkay so I Would probably wait then because of you if you aren't full retirement age is that gonna for every dollar you get on Social Security if you take it earlier they're going to withhold fifty cents of that\nSo you really aren't going to get that much side weight but it but when you do Social Security you want to do it about two or three months before you turn that age they'll wait until the day you can get Social Security for for retirement do a couple of months in advance so you can get the jak\nIt take Social Security about the good sixty days you can move and okay\nAnd you also got your Medicare Medicaid Medicare taking care of already correct\nYeah All right good good and are you married okay\nYou know what it might not hurt to come by the office and let us look at your Social Security and then you you're spouses and you know not knowing all the information maybe there's a different angle that we don't know about\n'em so if you want to do that we don't we don't charge or anything but I Would look started looking into that if I was you or\nIf you want to come out of Social Security revenues Social Security seminar next Wednesday at six o'clock in the uh library down by the are you a Catholic or the library McCain library there ... or call office three to nine Seventeen hundred and the scheduled time and we can look at ... years and your spouse is just to make sure we see all the angles\nOh well I just hung up or your class you're\nOkay perfect I'll see you there okay great they are always good to look forward to it thinks well\nYou know I like I said there's a lot of Social Security effects pretty much everybody that works and you'd be amazed at or the or how many um how many uh people just don't spend a lot of time figuring it out they use ... you\nKnow and everyone's got their own circumstance like that caller had\nNo question about his you know the answer and then like that\nSo we're we're going to take a break here and maybe get the call when we come back to ...
