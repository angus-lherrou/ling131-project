school or racing cars\nVery decent I'm\nNot a lot of people know about\nThe NAFTA and and I don't I don't know everything that's written and and so I've been reading more on it to find out what the changes in NAFTA to make it to us MCA and that's the United states and Mexico Canada association\nThe\nAnd and I you know these are these are going to be simplistic but are just reading some of the\nUh some of the things that is going is going on and you know candidate joined this\nAt all at the at the last minute and you just this weekend candidate joined\nIn and and agreed to to a lot of the trade negotiations been going on and and Trump has been blast some Trump the city that they can do it I didn't I don't like the guy that we've been talking to they're not very cooperative I don't see that happen and we're going to do things without Canada\nAnd we'll probably go after the cars to car manufacturing\nWhich I didn't know candidate was that big but ah this negotiation is going to stop on the U.S dairy products from being\nI'm so heavily terrorist in Canada you know it's going to help the kids\nIt's got to stop on the U.S dairy products from being I'm so heavily terrorist in Canada you know it's going to help the camp there to help the farmers in the United states because it's curbing Canada's high terrorists it's got to read it says reinvigorated car manufacturing\nWhich I\nI guess I did notice but previously forty percent of the car we made in China or other places China can do whatever and with few labor environmental standards and still considered North American\n\nAnd imported cheaply in the United states so I guess I guess you American Made car could be made somewhere else and imported and and sixty percent made here and forty percent made overseas where the agreement now drops to twenty five percent his data forty percent has to be made\nHere in the United states and they also did something with a with pay and I think that they have to I'm In the car manufacturers has to pay sixteen dollars an hour which which is a lot from Mexico if you're if you're working on cars Mexico\nHas to be sixteen dollars an hour or for the pay\nA also did something with drugs and drug development now\nWe've been hit hard and I know a lot of people in Port drugs from Canada the important drugs from Mexico because they get a better price than the United states you United States which is the biggest drug users on the planet and we we do a lot of drugs you know prescription drugs I'm Talking\nTo him and probably the others do that a prescription drugs well Americans end up paying for the for the development you know they are indeed research development all those kinds of things and it's very expensive sometimes to bring a drug to market can be a billion dollars or something sometimes it's very expensive uh to to do all the testing pass all the\nAll the hurdles takes to get the drug to market well\nThat goes into the price of the bill or injection whatever the case as that goes into the price or quite often overseas um they're just paying for the manufacturer not necessarily the orange gene Americans get stuck with that and ah which has both Canada and Mexico have agreed to respect drug bat and some biological drugs\nAnd and promise field of new cures for a period of ten years which means Americans won't be the only ones for whom companies can recover expenses\nLess good unless you're buying all your drugs from Canada all of a sudden they got truck same price as American they may not like it at that point [noise] um NAFTA\nAccording to this article is already do have some opinion and then says most hated trade agreement in us history\nAnd and maybe that's why we don't get a lot of noise about a ... a Trump just got this thing done you thought that the Democrats would be exploding unnecessary hateful a nest you know don't need to be doing now we haven't heard a word about anything like that no pushback from it no no applause\nReally because it was trumped again oh but apparently was most hated like a like a one in one in three I'm\nTo leave the agreement and that was a poll earlier in the year I mean Americans wanting to leave the agreement only ... I mean sorry once we thought it was beneficial one and only one in three thousand beneficial\nAnd uh so we're not getting a lot of pushback from that Trump's getting some some I guess silence is the best he can hope for ... ... it's not going to get any kudos but but but silence is the best they could do maybe [noise] um\nThis article also talks about to Europe and um you know and Trump has said before on Europe we pay for the defense of your we do a United States heavily pays for defense of Europe we have\nOh and Trump has said before on Europe we pay for the defense of your we'd do\nA United States heavily pays for defense of Europe we have we have troops there and we pay for equipment and we we pay for a lot into NATO and we pay for your defense and according to this article and Trump has said it before they reward us with a ten percent tariffs on us cars\nThey tear of our cars and we tear if there's a two point five percent so we buy Volkswagen BMW\nOr whatever\nThe terrorists are us to bring them into our country there's attacks are terrified two point five percent they tariffs with ten\n... anyway my next day early as next arrogant at a party mating sure\nWe're going to have a lady and they're talking about the death row propagation going on the ballot this year\nWell I Need I Need someone on the air with me to I Need to read them all have even read them all so I Need to its time\nYeah well there's a lot of my essay assigned thing about it a gas or or live in a road\nYeah that's a local asset\nYes I've had somebody down why ask if they wanted it got it\nLive in a road you know that's a local Masha\nYes I've had somebody that why asking if they wanted to come down to the Tea Party and explain that one too\nWell basically just a new tax money it's just a new taxes all isn't it says if you want your road six pay pay more and uh yep 'cause we're not going to do it otherwise and that's what it is\nYeah I Know\nAnd you know my last day of going out I noted Donald Trump he gave ... from the rose garden at ... the\nCapital sure\nWell the Democrats are being given air speeches dramatically any\nCattle country roads are [laughter] I Want to take my president any day care you have a good\nDay to serve but by and it was a girl and the reason I brought up flake is is he just criticize the Republican Party on Monday\nAnd he says I sometimes feel like a man temporarily without a party [noise] he was in New Hampshire Institute a pulse ...

for president after she decided to run for president it it fell\nAnd once you're in a political race like that and I and I guess there is negative news and scrutiny and all those kinds of things are itself she um she had her highest one of the highest at sixty seven percent when Bill Clinton faced impeachment\nUm she went up to sixty seven percent yes they felt sorry for her as bill was fighting the fight\nAnd um\nShe's down thirty six percent now compare that and Trump's at forty one present in and I and and nobody gets more hate mail and and media after him than Trump even though he is doing some wonderful job for the country he's getting he's getting hammered he's still about Hillary though\nAnd amongst Republicans he stands at eighty eight percent now and that's continued to climb since he's been in office he's at eighty eight percent\nA Hillary amongst Democrats as at Seventy seven percent and she gets four percent Republicans favorability\nUh well she may get back in the race I don't know if she gets back in the race and and I'm looking at her ... gone up and down up and down up and down or it doesn't go up when you get into a race it goes down so she decided to get back into a raise\nI I don't know does it go back up well maybe I I I don't know I don't I don't know but uh\nYou know you get the impression Hillary's not out of it there's always going to continue to\nUh to to be out there because she is continuing to do press conferences continuing to be in the news continuing to do a talk shows whatever the case may be and have our opinions are very public so you it's one that you would get an impression that she's still interested in\nIn not only being part of the resistance movement that's anti Trump or trumped arrangements and room but uh also uh getting back into the race and that's when that's quite possible\nI here's this here's a sword study on Americans were with a rather spend the extra money on and what they see this value in other words what would they would spend and get the best of something versus spin something and and cut corners a little bit not only do they get the best of those\nAnd you know what they save money on\nWell here's what they save on that that they don't feel important hands soap dish soap paper towels those kinds of things why they save on wind eating out this Avon casual shirts household appliances genes dress pants bottled\nWater and milk over the counter medicine sunscreen razors cooking supply soda phone chargers they save on those shampoo cereal pizza garbage bags they want to go to the cheap way on that\nAnd here's what they want to spend more on and get the best of something which I find interesting toilet paper I didn't know that I guess that's maybe that's gender thing toilet paper toothpaste toothbrush skin care\nCoffee and that makes sense I think Americans we spend a lot of money on coffee coffee dress shirts shoes large household appliances laptops in computers mobile devices which yes that's why we have iPhones and and Sam song and all the best of phones out their coats facial cranes clean cleaners cleans there's\nTelevisions and pet food now see I just said they don't the American scrimp they save on their eating out they save on food\nBut not on pet food we love our pets laundry detergent they spend more on a bed and the couch chairs and make up other than that we're going to save save money and we're going to scrimp on the other stuff\nJust so you know for you guys in marketing and you're out there and you're running a pet store see you want to put the premium stuff out there we love our pets\nVenezuela and we follow them quite a bit I've been following them for years because it's been an interesting to see them crumble it's unfortunate it's sad because there's real people involved\nAre but the socialistic values have Venezuela have crush them communist spring it started with Chavez announcement narrow a continuing hand in hand\nBlaming the west for all their problems as they continue to nationalize business has taken over governmental controls in the government running everything and it's continuing to crush them and they've lost two million people two million people have fled the country since two thousand Fifteen I'm surprised anybody's there\nI mean it's it's just kind of unlivable but since two thousand Fifteen people have laughed a neighboring countries of of uh\nI mean it's it's just kind of unlivable but since two thousand Fifteen people have laughed a neighboring countries him of a been good about leaving the gates open and letting people come in from Venezuela they're fleeting leaned in this way\nAnd\nNow the United nations in the refugee agency in the United nations has called for a non political in humanitarian response to the accidents\nNonpolitical response to an exodus because it's straining regional resources it's it's causing problems with the neighboring countries what what they mean by non political\nResponse to the exit is what is what would a non political things look like response going in and ask a than we do to stop your policies but we don't want to do with political you know\nOh but says five thousand people leaving Venezuela's daily you know just a walking over the mountains or whatever and and getting out of town\nThe uh\n\nUh but they um they are getting out of town\nWith they've continued to die I mean not the people I'm Talking about the economy economy is going to die in national has a camera on the women I think we're the richest country in that whole area that whole region they were the richest country and now they're impoverished where nobody can afford to live there let's take a phone call you on the air\nHey Ross it slowly hey good morning Louis morning a a\nNon political ... non politicized um means they don't want you to knock communism socialism or whatever they got down there are in other words don't don't ah\nYou know don't talk bad about it just because all these people are leaving their country well that's what's gonna happen anywhere that you got a communist socialist ... if I look at a you know before the wall came down or\nYou know Russia and uh so yeah they had to keep a Germany they had to keep the\nPeak going by force right that shooter let's say ... so I mean that's that should tell you everything you need to know about\nCommunism right there that people don't want to be there they don't want to the end of that regime but you know what are they going to do but then after risk their lives to lead or or whatever but\nUm [noise] that makes sense that makes sense to me that they want to be sensitive to lead them to not say anything bad about communism well then you can't fix it\nExactly exactly and and they're uh you know they are I think that that was kind of a back\nBackwards message to the United states to uh you know they need to open you need to open\nUp or open up your borders and let some more of these people in your country\nWe're not we're worse call yeah we're not all up we're not really a neighboring country either I kind of far away\nThey can make it up there I mean they can make it up here oh yeah we don't airplane and proven by those trains right\nSend up so uh I think that was just a backwards way of saying well don't don't make this political United States you know\nYeah but uh well somebody's got to fix them when\nThey did they do thanks\nA lot rank you buddy by by Louis ... um ... yeah that's what I guess that that makes sense and swimming by non political don't don't pick on their way the country is being run you know Nicolas Maduro just leave him alone is government or\nAn an inner being slapped sanctions believe in you know look all the way they ran rounded their elections way they've done things other countries around them of a slap in sanctions on those are the people are leaving the communist aren't leaving\nOr they've they've got a good bit of both but eventually they're going to run out of money to\nThey can't afford to keep the people but we keep them\nOh they've they've got a good bit of both but eventually they're going to run out of money to they can't afford to keep the people but we'll keep the the handful of communist I guess [noise]\nUm we talked about pet owners loving their dogs and loving their um their animals and they pay for premium food for animals we do as Americans I guess we uh we take better care of animals and we take care of ourselves yeah we're going to smoke and drink and eat cheap food [laughter] we're going to give give dogs good food\n[noise] what something we don't do I guess we are depressing them as an article that said put out by Dr Alexander lotto he's a Philadelphia veterinarian said the effects of smart phone usage on pets\nAre not good and and know the pets are not using smartphones but when we're home we're on our smartphone all day and we're over using this dark smartphone and it's making our dog's anxious and suffering from depression\nAnd now we got the White House ah that's slamming another a New York times report that they found somebody a bar patron that said he threw ice it him in September twenty fifth Nineteen eighty five\nOr to reclaim the common on was unprovoked needs who I said somebody called the police police did not file any kind of a\nUnique kind of charges at all but he's why should somebody thirty three years ago ... well I don't know that just qualifies him but are digging up anything they can sink a phone call you on the on the on the\nLine well good morning or\nThat that uh we're providing a lot around here yeah uh and uh but anyway that's another thing I heard on the news this morning that's never going to hold on just\nThat is true that is what Mitch McConnell says and that's the plan is to vote on it I'm unsure about it because the Democrats are doing anything and everything they can deposit to put off or to do whatever they can so who knows\nYeah yeah yeah I mean you can always say things that the grain of salt anymore you know in the news or any of that stuff you know it's just as you you don't know what the the only thing that you can believe any more is the worst of thought\n[laughter] I Know that's like saying that you couldn't believe that\nYou know in the U.S I think the\nI think the intent to Mitch McConnell is to have a vote I think that is generally what they'll do is if the votes not there and we don't have enough numbers are putting off and and that's why I didn't do it last week because Jeff Flake said we need an investigation\nYeah yeah good for like you know I'm Glad you asked that uh anyway so anyway let's say somebody\nYou too sir you took your ... or so who knows but Mitch McConnell seems pretty I'm

there is a glimpse of opportunity\nThere's a lotta glimpses there are the things that didn't materialize\nOr they just played terrible ... author ... to it it was a it was a very very poor showing by the United states and and you know very never took a swing but like I said\nBee aren't and the job that she did versus ... a ...\nNever took a swing but like I said Thomas beyond and a job that she did for ... a ... a pure got out coached he got out maneuvered he got out smarted he he got\nIn and his team got out place but uh it's uh\nIt's really unfortunate and maybe are the American teams are

understand um because we don't invite you here to take second place [laughter]\nYou know we're going to win at all costs and uh they they played brilliantly you know I just\nYou know here's Sergio Garcia you know he hasn't done a damn thing since you he won the masters really of any consequence and he just played absolutely lights out for three straight days\nAnd it was it was unbelievable\nBut I keep going back to bubble watching I mean you can't blame everything on bubble watching the team any Christmas eyed guy with his mood shots in is\nYou know is Aaron you know I'm going to hit the forty five degrees slice here and the\nSixty degree hook couldn't that oh God I mean he was in a fair way he was in the water he was in the rough he was into a bunker he was he was everywhere but on the green Iran you know you just talk out she was terrible\nIt was terrible\nI don't think he got past the fourteenth pool and one of his mattress\nI'd have to go back and check on that but I think I'm right I don't think he got past support team toll on any one of his ministers\nYeah come gosh ... you know it's terrible\nWell you know and the other part of it is you know even on the first day when they play you know the alternate shot I mean you you put her uh they're on a plan\nNine home if you think about it because they only get half the shot mhm and and\nYou know and you put some I don't know about that format\nThat it kind of and that really that really is kind of a weird format sometimes for you got the greatest players in the world and they have\nShot 'em\nWell you know it should be you know they they're they're just not executing anyway I mean we didn't keep us going in there now are getting\nLike close or they're not getting it straighter were bombers I have that field of ours are ah bombers\nThey just they hit the ball long the bar and and then he got what is coming in and they\nThey didn't I mean taking a driver or out in place in it you're teaching a plea was not their type of game and that's exactly what the Europeans are open for\nWhen they come to with means great they can bomb it that way or fair way though but the faster greens I mean now that our players and this does not do their players\nAre over ... years anyway I mean and and they need\nAdjust that's what a great golfer does they need to adjust to the game plan and they didn't execute or yeah or you know they had the you got you got you have two players too catty you have hand signals wanted to coaches\nYou got you got you have\nTwo players too catty you have hand take notes on the coaches and they're not even in the game frame\nLike they normally deal I mean they're like a good break right laugh anybody anybody got gas on this one and it's like player game you can do this and the European do it so it's like I just don't like\nIs this the way you did you just do what you know and play in the atmosphere and three and a couple on\nIt doesn't break right or left or whatever and they got hand signals on everywhere like\nWow that's\nThat's a lot\nYeah [laughter] I don't know [laughter] I [laughter] I I ... I think it's all excuse was I think that you know very could have done already\nHad the shot that that plain and simple they did not get shot but\n... let me ask you both of you obviously disappointed because because you had hoped that they have a team together that you do when you went into this thinking that there was a real chance America was good turns around and we haven't won in Europe since Nineteen Ninety three\nHim on paper was probably one of the best owns you've ever put together\nA she has to look at everything but one of the worst losses was off the chart yeah but one of the last time we ever suffer that right at different that's what we're talking about and and I gather you as a ...\nCat he has a point you bring that shame European team to whistling straits in two years mhm with the same team that was there today yeah\nAnd we could Russia so did we put the the wrong team was with the home team does it for the ... yeah she\nDid yes absolutely I mean and I think\nThat even like a you know I Know pick for mental thing I mean he was going to be on there anyway no matter what you know and that's terrible I'm sure\nThere was the pick ... been suited to that course\nI'm I'm I like well you know the guys are qualified the ... right yeah and it qualify\nI Would have shut them every one of them down and I would have said you know I'm not sure that this whole format is going to shoot\nYou yeah you know I mean nobody does that\nNo I'll call you a little politics but in Europe they don't care yeah\nOh in Europe they would've picked the guys that were going to yeah oh yeah this is not a ...\nThey don't care and that yeah\nYeah you qualify truly great but we don't think it'd be a good match show you're going to be a good boy and shut down okay\nWe'll Oh yes okay I'll do that oh yeah I'll take one for the team yes okay\nWe'll give you their ... or\nWhatever so the differences are differences our guys are trying to build recognition stats you know no you're you're ... you're\nAlmost right with the ... but it's not ... it's a test so status yeah yes\nYeah we go it's isolating so many right this is going to look really good on my resume when I go into the hall of fame\nOr just as good a ... page long yeah [laughter] [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nBut yeah [noise] but I think you know I mean we can sit here and be to sing to death but on paper you know I didn't play no we didn't know blight smart but what\nWould you look so hopeful going into your blood like oh yeah\nYou look at it on paper yeah and it's why how in the world can these people lose\nOne for years I expect you to look at a different way to well to sing America I mean Europe we oh I'd say by the time we get to Europe\nIt was one for years I expect you to look at a different way to well Susan America I mean Europe\nWe oh I'd say by the time we get to Europe again knock on wood I'm Still alive but I mean by that time we get to Europe again which I Hope nobody has forgotten what happened last week and a and a and M. and fortunately that's the problem with\nThe United states of America has a memory about as long as the blink of an eye\nOr\nEuropeans you know I purposely stayed away from this for two weeks [laughter] because I ... I didn't even want to bring it up but the European ... city for\nWinning they don't roll over oh\nI mean they just don't and\nBut American golfers as a team that was an individual but as a team you think do oh yeah I think there would be before they got an airplane and yeah I mean that certainly looked what happened I mean they roll out friday afternoon three and one in and day spend the rest of the time looking in the ... of course most\nSomething you know that's what the Europeans are doing they're going behind closed doors and they're doing everything they can to win and they did and they came out of the\nGame out like crazy strain or\nTarget you know it dates\nCame out shooting like crazy straighter target you know it they don't they they like pin tack we don't need shades around\nThe water has is that we get falls in the water you know all this stuff that we don't like they said that for so\nAnd then they just worked on target and accuracy and that's all you had to do to win that place mhm we didn't have accuracy and we didn't have you know our typing speed was\nI didn't I saw so many short pilot and they just didn't get there they never had a chance you know and it was like wow\nYou got to the those greens must be their smooth and they're in great shape but they made sure they were slower\nMhm just a little slower because when you come in our green every time they ... glass and they go way by and here we were short short short\nShort it's like gosh dang you're on a totally different her figure it out\nWell then and there are you hearing you hit the nail right on the heritage shed their cigarette out OK yeah adjust yeah because it certainly didn't bother you the first three of four matches in the morning on friday\nAnd then we're short cuts on those two didn't bother them at all rubble we potted horrible and we still want some point\nBut I tell you what of I I don't know I I I just think that I don't know who they're ... they're thinking about right now as as an next captain but\nNo censorship here I mean I I like Jim ...
