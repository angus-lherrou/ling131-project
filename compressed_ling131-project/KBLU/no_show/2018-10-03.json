I think\nWithout a non from Senator it probably would have been\nA now but at the bit of that but the ... the senators run the Russell I mean they're they're the guys\nAnd and I'm sure if it if a if a security personnel starts to come up in in a in a in a in a way from the senator like leave it alone in the bill and I'm sure that the Capitol police would accommodate now again this is just guessing a from being there and all that but those Capitol police are there to protect those\nThat you know the members and the members of the same as Aaron Russell building but uh\nUh but they still take them you know they still take cues from from the members and members of the reason they're all they're so\nMy only guesses flake allowed it\nCan't confirm to learn that worldwide troublemaker and lock him a\nWaste of Asian American citizen you know about her\nYeah any probably for the other places or know about you know a right where we said this before his worldwide arrest warrant out for him and he's from it and they go in because it was trying to destroy the Russian economy\nAre sort of they call them the man that brought down the bank of England yeah there's a few countries not happy with the ... these are like trouble maker is destroyed that great\nRally after Trump Organization and open society the one that was behind\nBut now we move on dot org and he's behind the water the protests in your darn right in the left wing or worldwide\nTroublemaker and shame what camp in some on them and lock him up\nWell but Romney's according to your ... your viewpoint she now there's many Democrats think he's a savior [laughter]\nOh yeah he's writing a lot of ... a lot more people out there haters guts\nAgain neighbor is riding a large actually do the Democrat Party so\n... yeah and then you know Bloomberg just gave the Democratic party twenty million dollars\nYeah well that's that's the that's the policy they believe in that country we are you know you got the freedoms to move the move that support the causes that you agree with as much as we find them distasteful there's others that don't\n[noise] I guess the president\n[laughter] and then I think he's getting better every year saying\nBecause they made a few remarks about that woman couldn't remember this or remember that and right away that\nGot Jeff Flake on the TV this morning when he shouldn't have said that they

Delaware yeah I have a friend that knows Coons personally and I you know he's in a way out in left field\nTo sure he's a Delaware's got very liberal politics so\nYeah and it's a shame because you know

out of office and we have some look\nLike February we can we can not talk about him anymore and that'll be nice\nBecause you know I Hope he doesn't screw things up a well and and really screwed

H your benefits manager good morning Christie\nAnd so um we're here this morning get we get to do this every year in thank you for coming in we have a major event coming up on October Eighteen or at the um the three C shown in conference center and it is your annual conference\nTell me why they support Scott\nSo this conference is really all about I'm helping our local businesses not just each are professionals I'm which I'm a lot of people think it is helping our local businesses stay up to date on\nTrends with things of that law um what's happening in the workforce um and and in particular this year focusing on how do we bridge the gap and the skills gap it's that's\nEver more parents okay so [noise]\nWhat is your role in this endeavor shore so\nI'm I Am the president of the southwest Arizona human resources association\nOr Sarah ... got it okay\nAnd so this is our fourth annual conference um it's something that we've been we've been looking forward to all year um you know we finished our our conference last year and within a week or two weeks we already knew what this conference was going to be about ... and started making plans for it so\nI Love it so ah Chris Scott drug you're in the studio this morning [laughter] so what is your role in the conference\nI Am tired of the conference committee okay and so I help line up the speaker is quite need the activities and location what's gonna happen and I've had a great business partner with me this year Kaye outrage and she's been a wonderful ...\nIs a rock star as I mean there are people who cross ... in this case I mean she's ... and crossing the so the cows come home she's exceptional with\nThat you have a great partner as well there was a great job for the city of humor\nSo Scott will be the one Christie if I'm a manager and I've got this team of individuals\nI Am running but I'm not in human resources department per se why should I come to this or that\nUm we're talking about some of the issues that happen and you talked about the keynote speaker talking about your business law what other speakers you have they are going to help us out on Thursday the Eighteenth\nSure so we have a the field services director for Sherman Sherman is an acronym society of human resources management national organization is sort of the er HR organization of the country or the our field services director's name is Scott faring uh he's coming in he'll be are opening speaker and he'll be\nTalking about um how to come\nUp with strategies to address today is serious skills gap so the the the theme of our conferences mind the gap ... um and and so she will be kicking that off with a presentation on how to um close that skills gap that exists\nSo is that part of a training strategy is a part of an interview strategy I mean how do we again we don't we want people to come to the conference was not given all the details but shore or is it multifaceted\nWell I'm so his particular presentation is going to talk about uh six different ways to help bridge that gap whether it's working with local workforce development boards are working jointly with other educational institutions um for example\nWe've got a we've got a couple of different at the hospital\nA couple of different schools and universities that we work with in relation to their nursing program so we can get it get their their um newly graduated nurses into ah into the workforce into the into the work field in and\nHelp them out talks about the ... I'm a big big topic I'm baby\nBoomers had to retain your baby boomers I mean they're they're getting now to the age where they want to retire and and that you know there's going to create a huge gap in the workforce I win that really starts to hit us and so how do we do that so history station is going to focus a lot of things like that\nAnd some of his baby boomers as we start to retire we're taking some uh local intelligence with us we're taking some historical knowledge with us\nOr in some you know situational experience with us as well so how do you transfer that to the next ... worker or because you know my style is acts in someone else's style might be why and how do you ... so again that's that's a huge process mhm is a huge process\nI think that they need to have an awful lot to offer the incoming millennials and and racing y\nOr Z or I don't know what they are now\n[laughter] that just to transfer that\nKnowledge and that work ethic and a half because today's generation and it's so vastly different mhm and how they communicate is different and I think it's important it's different and so although they're leaving to work for I think that so much to offer that I think they find it a little bit frustrating\nThough so Christie does that then create another training opportunities for some of us baby boomers who are examining how to pass that knowledge down because again my style ah when than talking to the next generation sometimes doesn't mailed because I'm a little uh I could be a little bit of a ... little\nLittle Neanderthal yeah adamantly up and down the training yeah because again this is this is important historical knowledge you want to pass on to workers that are just entering the workforce as well in in millennials learn differently\nWe all are naturally you know some of this limb by doing by seeing a by reading um some everywhere at all [laughter]\nWe all are nationally you know some of Islam by doing by seeing a by reading I'm so I'm never at all\n[laughter] but again how do you build all styles are you in your daily life working worms you how do you do that the milk those styles and and and get that done to the next level\nWell it it can definitely presented a conundrum rent 'em because at at worm see we have we have multi generations working I'm Christy mentioned you know baby boomers generation X. generation and why\nAre there is a new one now that they've now term ... spelled with an ex um [laughter] you know how do you get that to melt together and sometimes it's a very tricky balancing act\nUm because you know baby boomers have a different way of working versus millennials or versus generation X. I mean they have like different thoughts on how things should be said how things should work\nAnd so at least with a human regional medical center a lot of things that we try and focus on his respect in the workplace\nUnderstanding that that you know you're my way is not always the only right way mhm um and and uh\nEncouraging others to help share their opinions or thoughts\nPart of my team building training I Do at at the the chamber of commerce is talking about your frame of reference and our hardwired by the time we're six years old we're pretty much hard wired as to who we are how we are how we feel about things\nSo to to transfer that generation to generation can be a real tricky business so he wants to have at the conference\nSo our our third and final um speaker um she's a keynote speaker her name is ... James and she comes to us from Australia originally um I had a chance to listen to her speak um when I was in Washington DC last November\nAnd when I heard her speak I said you know if if we can we need to try to get her here um her presentation was powerful it was moving and I'm really helped myself to re commit\nTo a you know doing things in a better more positive way and so um I I'm excited for her um to bring some of her experience some of her knowledge here to Yuma and I'm excited for those that come to the conference meal to experience a representation\nSo how thick is or Australian broke [noise] ah it's they're using your [laughter] I think I paid Seventy five bucks just to hear that [laughter] and its captivating in in its\nUm so disarming you you're so engaging and if you want to learn in that environment yep absolutely and yup there's ... and so\nSo again let's talk about how to sign up for the conference I think that's pretty important and again even if you're not in the quote unquote age our world this is this is a very important conference you attend Thursday October the Eighteenth\nOr from eight o'clock to noon after shown in conference center at ABC registration is open right now sixty dollars which includes breakfast versus Arab members or members of the human county chamber of commerce\nAnd to sign up or do you do get more information it's a ... or S. A. H. R. A. dot S. H. R. M. dot org and get more information about that\nI'm so this is usually the fourth or fifth Scott ... that we've done force so [noise] what was the original idea you know four years ago what was the idea let's do this somebody was board somebody [laughter] somebody saw need you know tell me how we got here\nYou know\nI'm not sure I'm I'm the the best person to ask a you know I'm not a native view and I wasn't here when asked to her was originally got together um and when I first came to you my actually worked in California so I didn't even know that this organization\nAnd here when us to her was originally and get together um and when I first came to you I actually worked in California so I didn't even know that this organization existed it wasn't until I got to the hospital that I heard about this and I got excited about joining in and and you know trying to make a difference\nWhen I can say though is as far as the conference I think that we as an organization so her as an organization\nHave recognized the need to help our um HR professionals here in the area to help our small business owners here in the area and even large business owners\nTo know and understand more about some of the things that can you know if they don't know about them come back and bite him right um whether it's the department of labor um the equal Employment Opportunity commission EEOC\nUm things like that and so having conferences like this really allow us to help share some of that knowledge so that it's not just\nYou know up in up in the cloud right um where\nI think that's exactly what you mean counting the number of Congress got involved in promoting this because again you're helping small businesses you're ... you're making sure that they stay out of trouble which is always a good thing [noise] Ross recognizing the fact that that help is needed because the laws keep changing and the dynamics keep changing in the\nWorkforce keeps changing so thank you for doing that absolutely so and this is your first year or Christie of being involved with this ah on the planet committee\nNow this is my fourth year okay so you you saw this was infancy yes so what's changed in four years\n[noise] that's a really good question\nWe continue to see a need here in our community [noise] killing an educational gap and making sure that our business leaders and community at the knowledge that they need\nTo run successful businesses and and not see it as being so scary necessarily all the time right and ... as an organization that offered right resources um you know you can reach out to us we have meetings month\nThere the first Wednesday of them on the library and anybody can come and we always had a great speaker at the tests and so it's just an opportunity to build in our community\nAnd in the event itself has evolved yeah if you shorten their you recognize the need for small businesses to attend and I think the fact that you were very flexible in in your endeavor is to be committed so thank you for that so do we have a plan for next year let's get through this was the\nFirst I think right now it's let's say if there was this one first we'll give ourselves a week or two off after this one and then we get to work with the next one\nIn the in the benefits world after the break or talk about the evolution of managing benefits the evolution of a west transpires what's out there and let's talk about again the dynamics of the current work forces you were talking earlier of Scott or you're listening to temperature five sixty am cave Tio you [noise]\nIs of the lowest level sponsorship is a two hundred and fifty dollars that's a bronze level okay um but if if you don't feel like you can um you can do the two hundred and fifty we have given an opportunity for you to sponsor a student\nFor what a sort of idea for fifty dollars so um you know the the er and and that allows the students from WC or if they're going to the satellite campus here for in a you know if they're interested in going you know we we then um give them that opportunity\nA very a jar of you to think of something like that that's that's gonna be a very good idea is this something that you've done every year or is this something fairly\nNew okay what's your response been Christie\nFirst couple of years we had a really promoting it and I had [noise] well that's out there and really promoting the students and at times to an end and okay really encouraging businesses to sponsor then\nThere's the sponsorship also go to a veteran veterans as well or is it a different\nLine item I Believe this year it's desperation official students okay but you're getting veterans room gauge too is a huge issue and getting them back in the workforce um including out of their military life there there's a set of rules is a different set of rules in in the private sector\nAnd and our first speaker Scott faring will actually address some of that um ... he'll talk about what you can do to hire more veterans to give 'em ex offenders a second chance I maybe for some it's a third chance I don't know\nI'm and I'm also how to ensure that you're giving disabled workers an opportunity for them to be productive in in the workforce is where I\nPoint great point because some of us just don't know how to handle it I mean you carry it it can be and it's a learning process into\nSharp shore and and again it's all about it's all about this idea of mind the gap if you've ever been to London an opportunity to go a few years a few years back and if you travel on their subway system\nYeah but if you've ever been to London an opportunity to go a few years a few years back and if you travel on their subway um system you see the signs all over the place the same mind the gap and what is talking about is the gap between the train and the actual platform that you step onto the train\n'em because you know there's depending on where you're at anywhere from an inch to three inches of distance between the platform in the train\nAnd when we talk about um human resources or employment law or anything I mean that's one fast moving train and and that you need to get on it because if you don't get on it um you're you're going to get kicked on a pretty soon because I there's a lot of things that happened that you need to know about and be responsible for and so it's all about being able to mind that gap\nUm close that gap or at least be aware of it so you know what to do so\nAgain this can be Thursday after over the Eighteenth\nAn ATM to noon after shown in conference center at Arizona worse than college registration is still open sixty dollars first harrowing members or members of\nThe human county chamber of commerce and Seventy five dollars for the other memorials it's important to again or with a lot of the speakers that you have the Seventy five dollars very very well spent\nA we talked about the the costs of compliance begin this is important
