California Governor Jerry Brown for some time yeah is they put a lot of uh you know over aggressive wreck\nThey charge fees that are on necessary or they try to do to get a special favor for the government to allow someone to do business there and what I Want people to do is common test of course I'll be in charge of protecting public health and public safety but I Love them they're from tremendous success wildly profitable\nBecause I Know that they're going to have to build infrastructure and buildings that hire people and know how we got people working in a in fulfilling careers that takes care a lot of a lot of the issues that I have to deal with in the house\nAnd and you even asked if I if I miss the articles correct that that legislation looks at what's a good look like after they're on the road you want them to start seeking it with what rules regulations when you look at legal as far as liabilities and stuff which I think is a forward thinking and accepting\nAnd the other thing a rush that we're fortunate that we don't have to think about every day but I have to think about in my in my day job is think about what in a autonomous vehicle could do\nFor a disabled person or an elderly person or a blind person who had lost so much of their mobility and freedom because they can't drive\nAnd it's and it's hard to you know to to get a taxi in a place like humans hard to get a taxi no place like the sure or that you would have this type of ability and you can really see how uh the cost\nAnd price could come down over the course of the time so it gives that ability of ... for transportation immobility just so many in our state and then the other thing is is we lose thirty eight thousand Americans on an annual basis do two fatalities\nUp by human error behind the wheel yeah I'm the this autonomous technology not there yet\nBut it has the opportunity you know it it doesn't get tired it doesn't drink and drive it doesn't tax you drive\nA a ... you know doesn't fall asleep behind the wheel or so all of those kinds of things that are really privacy for for a brighter future\nI agree those right points um national security course we're in a place for national security effects is going right on the border you've been very proactive in contributing Arizona\nI'm taxpayers or or a National Guard or whatever it takes to to make sure that we enforce that border is that going to continue as you think we're going to get a national program that may start alleviating some of the\nWorld are two things one is it is going to continue I I'm somewhat who wakes up every day and\nThe first thing you have to address this public safety is as as the governor and I'm someone who believes that border security is national security and I I'm ... so we put together the board strike force we've worked with his federal administration we've deployed the national guard to the border because of a two hundred percent increase\nIn illegal activity a year over a year from twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen or I'm going to support the hard working men and women are that our border agents and that are part of ice\nAnd this is just dramatically different than my opponent who is someone who has said that they would abolish ice they would remove the national guard they would defund the borders strike force and they would remove the wall they don't want any physical barrier\nOn our southern border and to me this is a really reckless in an extreme or\nThis is not what we need while we're talking about stopping drug cartels and human trafficking and child sex trafficking you know all the issues that come with being a border state\nAnd we can continue to be a safe state while also valuing and embracing our number one trading partner which is Mexico and uh I don't and you know we've got a lot of a free flow\nBracing our number one trait art or which is Mexico and uh I Do and you know we've\nGot a lot of a free flow or at the port in a safe way that make us the leafy green\n... green vegetable capital of the world yeah eating much of the country and much of North America so we can focus on public safety keep our trade relationships and allow the good guys and the drops and the transit the tourism that happens at our borders to continue to flow freely it safely\nLet's get a good because we'd like to continue and also it's it's actually good for us the um the jobs now Phoenix Tucson you know some of those areas we rebounded more quickly since you know since we had the real recession last way too long\nUm when of course you ... is is now starting to get into traction and I I see we're a useless two hundred sixty thousand jobs since two thousand Fifteen\nAnd we're we're picking up steam which is wonderful or we we get to continue that is that uh you you think going into next year that momentum with a U partnering with federal and um and ah you know national politics is going to continue we're going to continue to feel comfortable\nYes I Believe if we continue on the path we are now and we we put our pedal for them that all of this will continue and I was a real focus I you\nKnow you're you're right about what you're talking about the entire state what we've been able to do but let's talk specifically ah in Yuma county we've been able to add six thousand twenty seven\nNew jobs in human ... two thousand Fifteen thousand six hundred and thirty six do residents\nAdded ... county and unemployment's down five point seven percent that's now needs to go to war it's higher than be wow it's going in the right direction or another appointment is going down what jobs are being added\nAnd when people are moving in those those are the recipes for a growing and healthy academy or and I want to focus in in our rural areas and then you specifically\nSo many propositions or coming up and I know you've got a couple of favorites like one twenty six I say favorites to oppose um any chance of passing\nOh sure I I'm I'm I'm concerned but there's a real chance of one twenty six passing\nWe don't want to do tax policy at the ballot box somebody to tell you as your God that are on it if I Am your governor going forward we're not going to raise taxes in the in the state of Arizona What took to put that up at the ballot box and leave no flexibility for tax reform\nAnd what I'd like to do is reform our tax code is booming academy you can do that because our our coffers and the general fund are overflowing right now I'd like you have a more attractive\nCasco here for people to relocate businesses to invest\nSo I I Want that kind of flexibility so I Want people to vote L. Y. prop one to six\nI Want people to vote on prop one to seven which would raise a family or electricity rates\nEnergy rates a thousand dollars a year and then vote vote yes on proposition ... five ... ... believes the school choice proposition thrill five will get you to expand school choice while protecting public schools in protecting the budget\nCare about and what we stand for [noise] [noise] yeah\n... it down to what she stands for [noise] cares about [noise]\nRight and she um she's she's definitely call cause for lack of civility until they get our again until they get power\nShe is a progressive\nProgressive it I mean yes they're denying it couldn't get anywhere they tape but look it up what Robert Wilson was that communist visual progressive showed up they are these are American asked were\nShut because they know the work communism by trying to shop at lead and lie to you and shake the ...\nShe said oh gosh I Can't you cannot based devil someone they watched it better than what we I care that she cares about and what she stands for\n... all the names the gyms become a mob it's been it's been mob rule in order to overthrow what we've done there's no question\nWhy can't the communist anyway in there that Alex Bowen now are you ... yeah what what what we're talking about he was on it for three months because they didn't expect when\nOh exactly right they thought Trump's skin a residency or again as he was a joke one of the joke was on there they\nThey don't get their own hands and he was ousted they look in the mirror I\nGuess they said what I\nSaid oh you're you're you're breaking up you're on the wrong side of the ... the bridges morning\n[noise] [noise] sound better better yeah you got it now [laughter] yeah that ... going to have a great prop there [laughter] [laughter] anyway ah ah is ah\nWhat is being this here I came up with a nine ... again but it's not that interested in it but I found it on the Internet ... and I have a little borrow it ... it has to take\nGentleman who is calling them demon ...

E. D. lights we've been doing I I Would say testing testing the lights to see what we wanted to go with 'em and and then of course uh we started reading up learning from other people's mistakes so we don't make mistakes\nThe police department or whatever needs when you when you say it's contained in the ... there's a there's actual recording device into there's a chip yeah shift you're just like in your cell phone you know all the cameras and pictures and then over writes itself after about twenty eight days\nSo it's constantly being a if there is always right now there is zero right we have none but if when they when they do get installed if they get installed then there'll be a chip in um that it'll be like all ... states stuff to just get recorded over\nAnd if something happens at an intersection the police officers have the opportunity to tap into that chip yes to hold on the video and and see what happened at the intersection at two o'clock in the morning right when somebody got in and and the fender bender yeah or you know there's\nYou know shooting or graffiti or even I mean all the way up to bank robbery anything being able to pull down and get description of suspect slice\nAnd making them they can pull that down I mean from the offices downtown\nWill have will ... will have Internet can network us some connect ability every one of those tips they pull out information that right and there'll be ... were very restricted who has who has access low we trust the government don't share every time I mean you guys would never know do have anything\nYou know that we're we're different than in federal level [laughter]\nBut I like to think that um I'm Glad that you think you are yeah um but that information is not going to be pulled into a central location know enlist it's needed because I think that's kind of smart because I Know\nI Know that anything that's on your computers have become subject to a public information inquiry right which will never happen than yours no it's going to it'll never be on my enlisted needed\nYeah exactly and then it'll only be it'll be you know in the\nIn the police department handled just like any other evidence I mean if you um you know there's things like when you leave your home and go to work you're on camera like sixteen times\nAnd you know it's ... it's going to be handled just like other evidence drank a you know and and that's the first thing in a police officer does now when he rolls up on a crime scene as he looks up looks around and see what cameras are out there and they pull video and are there are a lot of cameras Altman\nPrivate businesses galore and ATMs yes you know just different banks whatever they all have security cameras appoint onto the streets yes safety approaching vehicles leaving vehicles all those things just routine pretty much now yes and major businesses right you're being photographed everywhere yes you just don't know it\nRight uh so these would be an addition to that would be the government cameras which you have a unique problem in that if you have information it's subject to public inquiry yes so if you pull it into your central database\nYou could have jak Richard juniors yes every day saying I Want to copy that video from right and you would be ... you would have to have a staff of the hundred\nKeeping track of that yeah exactly so I'm sure you checkers elaborate since you don't have actual you don't have possession now but it's actually in the in the in the node yes and you don't access it right then it's not in your possession exactly they can't they can't ask for exactly\nThe only the only thing you know when people ask me well what about a quarter or while bottom line is if a judge tells you to do something you're going to follow what the judge tells you to do\nWith the judge will know you don't have in your possession its own owed yes and we'll see what how that works well no it's like a phone call you on the air\nGood morning I didn't I didn't catch the name of your guests\nThere but greed will ratio great will 'cause he's he's he's run in the entire city so you ask him anything you want to know about city\nHey Hey Greg are nice to talk to you use a wonderful city I'm a I'm a truck driver out here on the road but humans my home and the anyway uh I I think this technology is a good thing uh I travel a lot around Southern California around the Los Angeles area and what not\nAnd if people ever wondered how crimes are getting solved or the big city like that you know a city the size of LA how do they solve these crimes well the way they solve them is the way you're talking about right now\nYeah exactly in fact ...\nAnd ... ... you know the way the way a human is growing now humid and everybody anybody knows everybody no humans humans growing it's a city city and grows and\nThink I think any any tool that law enforcement can have these brave men and women that are out here every day but in their lives on the line any any to any tool that technology can give them is a great thing they they need the upper hand whenever they can get it\nYou know ... we we appreciate that and that's that's what I was telling Russ it's kind of\nA you know amazing initially got some pushback but now most of the calls are what I Want to make sure this is in my neighborhood you know at this intersection 'cause if anything happens I Want to make sure that you can get the information needed to bring the bad guys to justice and and\nUh yeah ... ... exactly exactly and and anybody that's less than if they have if they have doubts about there are private security and they're they're they're uh\nYou know uh having somebody watch it it's not like that this is a tool for law enforcement and ... and like a like Greg said the way it will ... will not take down any of your information or anything like that\nAnd ah one last thing I like the state before I go\nEverybody that's listening you know if you see a cop in a store or the circle K. or a highway patrol officer and the store and he's getting up something to drink or or or do that or something or or whatever if you can afford it\nYou know a ... tell them tell them thank you tell them thank you for what you do and and and and go ahead and buy that soda for them or by that doughnut for 'em or whatever I Do that all the time and I see a highway patrol inside a circle\n... or something and they get they get into something to eat or something I say hey hey man I got that for you you know so you know just just just congratulate these people and their bravery is astounding you know when I'm going down the road it late at night and I and I see the highway patrol's\nGot somebody pulled over they don't know who they're dealing with you know they're they're brave people I don't know if I could be that brave absolute brave enough I'm\nBrave enough to hollow loaded cows down the road but that's about the extent of it\nThat's enough for me I appreciate the comment to take care not right you got one sport\nWell that's what I was telling me running what's kinda turned and and people now are are seeing that these things actually have a well have a really big benefit\nBut there is a concern in and I know you're concerned also about big brother or your liberty and ... were you given up liberty or you're not giving up liberty\nCan we trust the government right these things when I I think we can trust the government I don't think we have a lot of options and I think there needs to be checks and balances and we need a\nYeah I mean one thing that the council did and we're we're putting in place to different committees one is going to be citizens review committee that's going to a post he meant kind of do I guess it's an odd it ought to know why we why and when and what for why we access the information that's going to be us\nAnd then within the city I'll also have a group that looks at all of our operational procedures and and that type of thing so there's going to be a couple of checks and balances that we already have a\nPhone call you're on the air is good to hear your voice yeah good morning\nI got some I don't want to go about getting one of those cameras on one of my street light [laughter]\nThey're coming they're ... ... you live inside the city\nOh yes sir yeah\nAre they are they are coming it's probably going to be a a few a few months before they come in and we started installing but uh yeah I could talk to Greg yeah you can give me a call\n... gimme called city hall to this writer yep three seven three fifty eleven I reject bikes for can get one on my street that's what I was telling your us I mean people are you know the other thing too is uh\nAre are real hope is that these actually act as a deterrent because people are not going to want to do bad stuff you know when they when they know that that they're going to get caught in a wreck all the bad guys do these things they can get away with this I'm smart and\nI and I know you're a you're aware of other cities that have had success yes\nIn in in United States there's some you know that we do have some cities yeah they'd have a lot of cameras\nMhm but so you are Chicago LA when I was going to say some of them are and to places that have terrible yes which like Chicago yes I guess they got the information and what to do with it I don't know well I I've\nHeard and I am confirmed as yet that they they did a deploy cameras kind of in the south side of Chicago and said you know one of the batter neighborhoods and uh\nThat it has dropped crime has dropped I don't know you know there's a lot of other issues Chicago has yeah but uh you know in the other interesting thing is that uh LA and San Francisco\nAnd LA Unified School district are all have a contract with the same company\nAnd we are looking to uh they're contracting out to run a network or operating center a knock which actually monitors cameras to alert those organizations 'cause obviously\nCan't remember how many streetlights LA has but if I Believe yeah you know it's good to see exactly and ah\nWe're working with any come to locate that facility here creating jobs and all that stuff so they would remotely monitor that for LA county in San Francisco\n\n\nPaying five sixty gave you a card with your [noise] so it was a great if you walk out after the comment still here [laughter]\nThen that's good oh you can't hear you know you must have done something with your a plug in down there wasn't me or you know you're also got the um and I did mention the bottles before I went because I Want to talk of roads okay and inroads have been a a road road about subject for the whole the whole state yeah for ten years\nYeah I've been talking about um for nine years around\nYeah yeah it's been represented counties and cities it's everywhere though um I don't like what the states don't they pulled what ... billion dollars of as it was all off the table but should have gone into roads yes and a lot of that money belonged does yes and\nAnd as a result of cities and keep up and keep up and right when the county you know there was more funds put in on and I want to stay on the city you guys never putting more funds into their ...\nWe did not put general fund into or other roads yeah wait well ... you know I'm sure you're aware of the conversations with the police and fire and and all those other kinds of stuff about you know losing police officers the higher paying jobs so that the general funds\nAre not been a in ... not had enough money to be able to take out ... and to supplement all these other or all all these other\nPlaces ... patch repair do what we can has been order of the day as it has\nBeen across state yes yeah and that's you know one of the things that if somebody gets up there as\nWell why haven't we been talking about this stuff in Wyoming and brings like when you stop wherever you may have been it's been going on since I've been on the radio yeah and uh since I when I was in county supervisors and believe me I did a lot of talking and lobbying in it that are all\nAnd I think we were able to get them to stop stealing not to replace yes\nYeah and then that's in you know and that that's I think that's the biggest issues people will get the money back and say well that money's gone you know they you know you\nYou saw red Fred education short a billion dollars trying to get back everybody's trying\nTo get well that money is not going to be coming back no and the governor is not going to raise taxes right\nAnd I I guess the ah said he came to the realization there's not going to be a relief there's not going to be a fix it unless we do it locally like Maricopa Pima mhm and some of the counties have done like\nMaine is doing one team is doing what I mean they're they're all over the state everybody's always come to realization we got to take care of ourselves\nYeah we've got supplement with states not doing right because they want to keep gas to get gas prices lower\nMhm and that's usually what ... is the tax on gas yes but then they swept stole 'cause we can't trust government just no matter what you look at just can't trust them right um and uh they tax just for the roads and then they took it\nYes it's a simple state did\nSo now you're looking at this uh for eleven\nWhich\nI guess I resist push back at first Greg I'd just do because I'm Still angry that the state doesn't do what they're supposed to\nWell I'm I'm Upset about it too you know I mean and you know we pay I I don't like new taxes too but what what are you going to do you know the state's done this and and well now it's it's either up dust either take care of our our problem\nWe have an adjusted vote for a road funding in this state since the nineties right Nineteen Ninety One I think is left on their ... and it hasn't been adjusted giants and then we stole what was in there from the nineties yes so obviously we're not building roads like we should and something needs to be done and and there is nobody with courage and in Phoenix\nAnd the legislature because they want to get reelected would ever dream of of fixing it\nYes I I Would say that's that's the case there is no current appetite or memories to be able to do what needs to be done\nSo it's going to be up to the cities and counties municipalities yes to get it done and for Lebanon is is the uh the solution is put forward on this next now\nYeah citizens group got got together and you've interviewed a couple of them uh\nI didn't have any choice [laughter] [laughter]\nIt's like you know they just broke in [laughter] you know I always have choice that you know I was glad to have let's say the phone call real quick you're on their\nHeight their little again out in the failed I just wonder if people knew that next LA Mac Sally and send them are having to say that word it haven't had a debate tonight at six o'clock on a Arizona Public a network of college you know which one I'm Talking about\nI I Do know but but I didn't I didn't know they were doing it tonight I so I appreciate that information well that's\nWhat I heard yesterday was tonight outlined day\nAt six o'clock it wasn't hard to turn it on in the eye could see that I don't want to do it anyway I just thought point that out\nThank thank you Bye bye yeah it's been an interesting race that has really taken a turn a with all this news on cinema I Know you don't comment politically but I Do but the cinema stuff that's come out\n[noise] I've I've known her for years and I know she's not who she's been portray but I didn't know all those uh soundbites existed yeah that really put her in a bad light yeah I was pretty interesting listening to those yeah recording on how she feels when she gets out of the state she goes over to Texas and says that Arizona's fault crazies you don't want to become like Arizona\nI got to go back to Arizona and run for office was like what he's doing obviously shouldn't yeah just shut up but no she's a decisive she exposes we know she has\nA but only for eleven for the fix our roads\nUm you know one of the biggest concerns I think most people ask is how can we trust you don't wanna sweep the money\nWe uh the citizens group kind of came to came to us and asked about it we agreed to first of all the language that they have does not allow the money to be spent anywhere else you can\nElse a second is uh we we've agreed that we will obviously this was a second what we call enterprise account another enterprise account which will be completely\nTrack separately than we also agreed to make a a currently we put our Shiite the projects on a website\nAnd we agreed that if this past we would make a separate a website with all of a Shiite the projects that would track exactly where the money yes and that will be posted on our on our website so we've agreed to do that too low more transparency more ability to track it and in those types of things\nGeorgia if this passes or coming up and by this time next year all roads will be fixed I Know what it is going to take us a you know I think you you will see the uh\nYou'll see an impact I think are starting July first of next year but the tax kicks would kick in the masses January first and then of course the the revenue actually legs a couple of months behind that and then you see some things initially but then it would be built into our a\nShiite the budget starting July first Star Wars in the roads didn't get this way overnight so my estimate is that it will take us probably up to five years to recover but um you know it's going to take a while to take care of this but I I think you'll see an immediate impact\nAnd then uh and then of course everybody's going to come up okay when when does my road going to be fixed and but I I I estimate that uh you know it's going to take us a couple of years but you'll see something immediate if it passes and then you'll probably take is about five years to catch up and get the roads where they need to be you know\nJust keep the lights dim until they're all fixed I Want to see how bad they are we'll be right back in

um that's not the topic though I have an electronic gadgets are like on the list today All right so I'm One of my new favorite gadgets is the echo\nThat Amazon Echo you got into I see so many people do it I don't know anything about it right and some people are a little bit leery about jumping into this because they feel like they're going to be a ton of a big investment in time to learn how to use this device and maybe bring it into my house and they spend the money and then\nMoney and then nothing becomes of it and it's a waste I'll tell you this is a really really easy device to 'em operate and I'm not the best at or doing my homework beforehand I like to just jump right in and if it's user friendly than I don't have to pull the instructions a trash can so\nYou've never read them [laughter] [laughter] I Do like half as if I have to read the instructions than the devices too complicated and that the echo dodges what I've got so there's a variety of versions of\nThe echo you can

that law shown garden or what the decent garner law firm and we're talking about estate planning but that kind of threw a ... year we took a a little bit of a um detour we're talking about\nEchoed dots and or that goes in general those devices and how they work and so I I got them all throughout my house and I was using them as the intercom feature or my house and got 'em all glued into every um child's room couldn't walk so they're flush them out and then I\nHave I bought the power source off of the\nOf course and it's called a power over ethernet injector or P. O. E. injector so basically what it looks like it's a bunch of 'em bowling jacks in a row eight of them in a row and it's not just a bone jak it's it's a little bit wider jackets to eat the net jak\nAnd so what you do is you you plug that into the wall and it it converts the electricity down from a hundred and twenty bullets or the AC to twelve a bowl\nOf DC now that that is very clearly printed in the instructions right next to a little um exclamation mark in red in a triangle [noise]\nBut I didn't read that because those instructions or in the trash by the time I get that box open and so I I get this thing yeah I get this power strip out and I plug in each one of my devices so they're all hooked into the central location and then I plug that baby in a in a little bit of sparks fly\nThen I go to the election I tested out and it's not working and so I'm like what\nEach room and I and I try to test it and none of them are working\nSo I take out the base plate because this was glued onto the face play to pull that out and um\nBecause I've got young kids I wanted to make sure that these face plates were solid so I got this tough as nails silicon um cocaine and ... those suckers and so they ... they wouldn't move and so I had to like take one and fry it apart and it took me a good half an hour just to\nGet get it out and so I could use the adaptor that came with it the five\nOf old\nAdaptor that you plug into the wall and then you plug into the election and I'm like okay so I'm going to see what's going on with Alexa Alexis still not turning on well it didn't take me very long to figure out\nThat this five ... device or doesn't play well with a twelve volt\nPower power so [laughter] [noise] so\nEvery one of these Alex's that I have scattered out throughout my house in\nAnd installed um our our fried and my kids I Hope they're not listening to the show because they don't know yet they got up um Sunday Morning and they said hey dad my life is not working and I see him all throughout the house and they're talking to a ... and ... and does not say anything because it's still a little too fresh for me [laughter]\nAnd I said yeah yeah I Know I'm a I'm I'm working on upgrading it and uh I I'm waiting for a part to come in a truth be told we're ordering seven new\nYou'll get an oil eventually wired worked out working humming yeah\nAnd I really think so I really think this is going to work and and I and I have had them working where you know I've had him in multiple rooms in it than I dropped in on the road and they weren't great and you program each one to a different like give me give me grace you give me the kitchen ...\nYes so you so you see all access to wake it up and then you say drop in on Gracie okay and uh so there's a apt to download on your phone and you can see each of the devices that you have in your house and then you just tap on it at at the name and and you name each device where you want to talk to\nOkay and so then you say hey ... or a Alexa drop in on Wesley and it'll drop in on his real you know if you want to give them a little bit of notice um or you they're not answering then you can say Alexa call Wesley\nAnd it'll actually reading his rules making my answer and it'll make him answer and ... and they used it before I fried all of these things on Saturday Night 'cause I got the part in it it\nCame in Saturday at a six PM and so by eight PM those suckers or fried but before six PM um I had them working and I was I'm In the car trying to get a hold of my son\nAnd I'm calling a cell phone but you know they don't answer either they don't answer their cell phone I don't know if they're actually like declining Michael Moore they're saying that it you know it was on vibrate or whatnot but either way he wasn't answering his phone and so um I just the election when you download the app\nYour phone becomes virtual Alexa so then I say on my phone Alexa call Wesley and then it keeps ringing and then I can say called the whole house and it'll bring all the electricity\nWas how he can do the whole house yeah all points bulletin ah every month yes and it's and that's very cool and so then uh ... what are the I had a kind of like an Amber Alert ... yeah right and and and I even have it out on my porch right [laughter] so if they're outside\nSo then finally I just I get an answer hey yeah what's up and and there are a little bit we will do it because I was the first time I use that function and they're like a hello [laughter] [laughter] I could really played with or has it that but I think he does and uh so I said why don't you know when you're ...\nHey so that then they just call me back on their phone really cool device but um so I learned some very important lessons from then there's the why do why I project I'm number one\nGo and do try experiment with it um you learn by experimenting I learned that that you should probably pay a little bit more attention to the instructions of a power source before you plug it in um but I also learned that these aqua devices boy they can do a lot of things and they're really cool to really fun\nUm but I also learned that uh you can go wrong really easily unless you do your homework first and uh so let's wrap this back into what the show is supposed to be about and that is estate planning\nAnd talked about some things that we learn through the school of hard knocks on estate planning um\nYou should try it out before you need it right I I'm installing all these at goes into my house because I Want to contact my kids in case of emergency because\nWant to um be able to listen in when we're out on a date and see how the kids are doing it can work as kind of like a nanny um device\nAnd uh I also want to if if we're we're leaving and getting in the car in the house to the whole house that we're going but that's before the emergency comes not we're going because houses on fire right I could use it for that but I don't want to wait\nFor that point before I'd try it out and get really familiar with it to see how it works and your state plan I think can fall somewhat loosely into that category when you think about estate planning many people think about well when I die then that's in my state plan will become effective that's when I Need to use it\nBut there are so many other events\nThroughout life that you will need up properly drafted estate plan\nOne of those is when you go into surgery right whether it's a routine surgeon appendectomy those can go wrong anything can go wrong you need to have your health care power of attorney\n... which formed as it use\nIt'll call Britain these um phone or if my using your phone to call her phone or yes I'm trying to think how that weren't house phone or your cell phone while I thought your phone and be Bluetooth that's how we're the phone or the Bluetooth and we don't have to unlock it do you know you don't have to an end and it was if it if you're in the same house\nIt's going to be using your wife I connection and Nick and I can tell it's called Britain these mobile so it'll call her phone or I can just say I'm since I'm the Alexa in our master bedroom is called master bed when they get very creative I mean I think a more narrowly [noise] but I say I'm ...\nI'm called master bedroom and it'll call it'll ring it or I can say like a drop in on master bedroom if I really think that Britain is there\nAnd show and I'll say hey Brittany I'm stuck under the car here [laughter]\nYour your mind are coming out and use a hand or ... or something [laughter] so no it's really helpful\nFor that aspect um and as far as the the whole baby monitor thing you know I've gone through a bunch of baby monitors these things are they're great because they they they just work\nYeah well I imagine this is better and probably more secure than a typical baby monitor you always hear a baby monitors you can pick them up on scanners are on on other are if a devices or do you address anyway the point being um you can't really do that 'cause his wife fights all contained within your network\nSo they have to actually be able to hack into your wife find your home which you generally got password protected list I recommend that you do\nAnd um which was also need about these though is if you have a a trusted friend that you want to communicate with on a routine basis if they've got an echo than than um you can add them to your list and they can accept it and I can say hey I'm Alexa dropping on Cody\nAnd it'll go in and say hey Cody I'm at home you know getting ready to watch the football game you want to come over and so it's an inner come between any household that has it as long as the other person accepts that\nWhen I hit a notion I Do not know that the I thought you had to be on the network you know an awesome\nAs long as you um yeah invite the other person in fact they've got that new echo device out and no this is turning into a tech show but it's called eco spot\nAn echo show and and um the echo spot is just a little round device and it's a both a camera and a screen and so you can say I'm called Brittany and if she's there in the kitchen she can say hey what's going on and I can see her ... and if you can do it from your phone because your phone\nConverts into a virtual echo when you download the app and so my phone's got a camera on it and ...\nAnd uh it's it's super cool to monitor it's like a nanny cam that you've got there if you've got your young kids at home um my kids some times are troublemakers in fact we came home a couple of weeks ago and um we've got this balcony on the second story of our house and my five year old who's\nFrom day one when he was born and Pete on the doctor has been causing trouble and we got home and and uh our babysitters locked out on the balcony [laughter]\nHundred degree has his duty exactly\nSo um anyway it's it's helpful for those different things um anyway I wanted to get into some other events that are coming up one\nThat uh I found particularly interesting is there's meteor showers that are happening right now\nAnd well they're they're starting tomorrow there's I'm going to be a meteor shower it's called the ... or I ended a meteor shower\nAnd uh it's from Haley's comment is passing through and his leaving a trail of debris and as earth passes through that trail of Haley's detail of his comment it causes a meteor shower were able to see that\nAnd um the high point of it is going to be on October twenty first so if you like to see a lot of shooting stars if you need a lot of good luck\n... um you're going to have\nA good opportunity to see several students stars they anticipate that it'll be twenty for shooting stars per hour\nAt the peak of it and that's on Sunday you know what time to start a ... well I'm I think the best time to look at it too I'm I'm looking here at the end the sky dot org and it says a midnight\nAnd you've gotta look basically at uh the eastern horizon\nRight at midnight that will be your best viewing points for all days were just Sunday or the old days if you midnight at that time that's when the earth isn't the best position for you to see the trail coming through the atmosphere causing those shooting stars and um\nBut if you do it on the twenty first that's when you're going to see the ... most of them now they say if you're in a typical city atmosphere where there's lines around and you're not going to be able to see as many of them so you might see only about seven per hour you know go to telegraph past talked about there you go that's what I was thinking there you go\nOn and and I ... I was taking 'em and astronomy class and a WC when I started out in school back ... years ago\nAnd that was one of my favorite classes we sat out we watched the meteor shower and it's something that I really remember vividly today I just think it's it's it's one of those really heavenly events you concern is so encouraged people to do that um October twenty first is a prime viewing date we're coming up on another break\nHere but when we come back we're going to go to the mail bag and we're going to take some questions that people have emailed in about estate planning issues and we're going to answer those questions over the air so again um before we go I just want to mention that we have seminars on October Seventeen and on the twentieth that's at ten thirty am\nAt the seventeenth at the main library and the twentieth at the foothills library will be back this is five sixty and keep you [noise]\nA question for phone lines are open for free for for five to five three four four came down [noise]\nHi honey guess what I just discovered an extra Fifteen hundred dollars why now well I met with our attorney to review our trust planning and he pointed out a few things that need our attention like what they're", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "15"}
