the Democratic party or someone\nSuch as them created this chick our eyes away from the ...\nMan I just I don't have enough information speculate but it certainly looks like not a real threat to create mayhem and death it looks like a threat to scare you know which is still terrorism but um\nI think it it and they're doing it to keep our eyes away from this caravan hey yeah I think all the media\nI think everything's possible but\nAnd and this and and they send me stay out of this you know it does I Want to get fully educated ... ... I don't every member Trump challenge people to go out cause mayhem to Democrats\nNo here's here's the only thing they ever said back\nWhen when he was in the early on in his campaign back in two thousand sixteen do was a just a disruptive guy that was you know struggling with security and he said uh you know get that guy outta here I'll pay for your you know your legal fees if you help you know whenever\nSo they they you know that is one and the other one I think I guess last week he's he admired guy 'cause he body slammed the journalist\n[laughter] I think those are the two of those are the two\n... play and they were playing on the film like this morning\nThat it's his fault and he's created a\nYes yes and that's been about Maxine Waters or even Robert De Niro isn't Robert narrowing the ones that you'd like to get Trump's but\nNobody wants to watch them in the face he wants to punch them in the face and so did a show that Joe Biden and a soda as Tom ... talks about a ... you know mob mentality on a regular basis you know when it's on an F. word out there and that's a Democratic National leader\nDo with all that I was listening to you know on the news that both the ... that's how I come to my conclusion this is wag wag the dog wagging tail whatever the heck it was a when Clinton was doing a Monica and he had to I think we we bomb somebody it take to\nThe Chechen away from so what was going on\nSo you think it was Democrats have dinner or a Democrat or a ... I\nHave a democratic supporters ...\nSee I I don't think we have enough information for me to make a speculation but that's that's interesting and anything's possible\nThis what what's great about America where we can speculate ... I'm not accusing I'm just saying hey\nSounds it seems like every one of these\nPeople was a democratic order that had said something about a great president now um [noise] but I like this one looks like this long ain't no damn rose\n[laughter] three she had to call buddy you take care of speculation always makes me sad milk goes look I speculate when I'm going to do with a billion\nDollars I went on the laundry and then I'd do women over ...\nI Can't believe they just metal herbal herbal um\nSince since he brought it up on the bottom we'll talk a little bit about it but um I think it's too early for me to even speculate anything a whole we know is\nIs that people investigating with him and visit ... just going to infect there's we've already told us and things are ...\nYeah misspelling names very big letters most age that they just hand delivered obviously because it's not so smart\nAnd it it's it's like a mini people have commented that are in the industry of bills you know protecting us say it's it's unusual because it's like screaming at you look at me and versus people would try to hide a bomb you know this is the opposite and many of 'em did no\nNone of them

handle that with a with a smile\nUnit had a whale little messy [laughter] yes I Do [laughter]\nAnd put you handle it would fund and not a not negativity at all you know you don't what's the point there is not there is no but the but you don't uh you laugh at it was actually due to the smaller your way through it and show them how the how to use your welder better\n[laughter] right exactly okay but when you're done talking let's get to work [laughter]\nThat's awesome and now you're going to be at the event this weekend was it friday and Saturday or is it a Saturday\nWhere they are the show in China is both friday and Saturday or friday it starts at five and I'll be doing demonstrations five o'clock six o'clock and seven o'clock there are going to be two bands I think there's a band at seven and eight\nAnd so once the music starts we probably won't be doing demos and then Saturday morning at ten am the gates are going to open again and it's from tend to three will do demos um ten eleven twelve and one I Believe and then\nI was told between two and three it's going to be really exciting because there's going to be a lot of raffle prizes your\nOne dollar admission ticket is going to be a raffle ticket and you'll be eligible for all the different ... and all the vendors are donating at least two prizes so\nWhoever showing up there on their own and like a million or you know I didn't make him in for that I actually made something else that um but yeah we're\nI think what we'll do I say we because it'll be me out there demonstrating but then\nAlso I've invited to Yuma territorial blacksmith so we started this group about well I don't know seven years old school stuff right well that's how I started actually at the college I started on election I think so and then he used to teach the licensing class out there so there are going to be about four of us out there hammering got 'em for just\nUm will have some safety gear is if people want to try that will will have a very small group that can do that because we won't have enough animals space but um so that the territorial blackness will be out there and I think what we're going to do between hammering and then welding will probably make some of the a raffle prizes right there on the spot\n[noise] well I'm going to a ... because I've I've got to challenge this weekend for three days I'm babysitting a thirty ... she's my one year old granddaughter oh wow that'll challenge you will not really I mean for her because I remember this I'm going to wear out that's Michael O o\nChallenge I sat there [laughter] year old is like oh grandpa [laughter] I ...\nBet your goal middle do but I'm Wondering who's going to use your Monday\nMorning I think when I was going to ask yeah I was laid on the ground sucking her film now [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nAh but I I Want to or parents are going on you know my my daughter and my son in law will be going to the beach for three days so I'm going to be sending them\nI'm going to be sending them pictures constantly of where are you a narrow\nPictures so I Want pictures of her with welding and it's not a I don't care animals yeah we put her in little welding helmet and put on a helmet yeah all of that uh but I Want them to worry right like\n... became I come home early [laughter] another um I've got some more pictures\nYou can take so downtown main street mhm right in front of loose a today at four o'clock the installation is unveiling is officially happening but um I've got three sculptures that are real wrote deems that are being actually officially added to downtown historic Yuma mhm that have been welded um one and are kind of Nineteen hundred steam\nSo there's the beginning of the train sort of abstract there's a real car and then there's the caboose and so because they're on the pedestal that you can walk around she could you could proper up in front of each of those sculptures and on and take more pictures\nOf do that yeah it looks dangerous\nRight well definitely the first one has like years all over the place you know what all our hearts are\nBeing an automotive industry yeah I don't uh I don't want to do anything that's not life threatening\nExactly yeah miniature terrifying [laughter]\nIn fact I'm you know I have heard standing next to assign\nA you know sky diving for kids or something yeah\nYeah I'm looking for signs that say like a radioactivity no injury\n[laughter] runs with scissors\n[laughter]\nYeah I'm sure to come home early obsolete other birds you know acne cutlery company [laughter] yeah you save [laughter]\nYeah we'll we'll be visiting as many a dangerous places as well as we can get into\nThe mine shafts lots of mine shafts in Yuma\nThere you go ... or don't fold down them with what you're doing the safe absolute because you'll have all the gear and all the coverage and even though you're in a busy place or you're going to have enough grapes or whatever to make sure that no one gets uh problems with staring welding correct sold stairwell to\nRight yeah it it will give you a headache you kind of like staring at the sun\nSo we'll have some wild and curtains up so people are walking by they can just peek at it and if someone wants to try and they can sign up we'll have a sign up sheet probably at the stage I'm not sure how the logistics are going to work with that\nAnd I'll take a couple of people in our and then you could do on the uh the jacket the gloves the helmet and come in and make something that you could take with you\nKnow well that's that's cool at a school is is there ... there was a fee for the material or\nUh I'm gonna use donated materials so don't do too much or even to this is going to be me out there and\nSo you use junk yup exactly will have some where she was out there and then um I've got some scrap from liberty motor sports that is going to come with me okay and then um Arizona scuba shack actually is helping us out because he's putting compressed air in a scuba tank so that we can have fun with getting out there as well wow I Know this is this good community\nYeah I Do a lot of people to ... to touch something that that that looks like it's way outside all their league right exactly but it will make them feel you know less mystery about it\nAbsolutely and I think too when people start seeing some of the sculptures that are at the airport that you know we'll have when the sculptures are judged they're going to have um the name first name comment and then the age if it's a child and if you see that a nine year old created something you're going to go okay I can probably attempt something like that [noise]\nYou know really we're we're not a one world order founding according to our constitution thing there's many and that they would like to change it to that\nA lot of changes that don't realize\nJust how good we have it now\nNo and they don't know till it's gone and say wow I think we made a mistake you know ...\nGot this guy coming in from this was brought up in Venezuela mhm and\nRight they got to listen to his story\nRight and do and we don't see it as whale and went went from being one of the most prosperous countries in the western hemisphere in the world can't feed to not who are the people are starving and takes a wheelbarrow full of money just to buy a\nCup of coffee a couple of ... really that's yeah it's it's crazy inflation rate is is is ... I think I've I was reading something\nInflation rate of something like a million percent I haven't read that would have had like\nYou know like seven thousand or eight dollars ... it was crazy I mean that's that's insane that means that dollar buys a cup of coffee on Monday by the end of the year ... eight thousand eight\nThousand dollars for a couple of our because they thought I better be started off yeah\nSaying that means a dollar buys a cup of coffee on Monday by the end of the year ... eight thousand\nDollars for a couple of our because they thought I better be darned yeah Ted I stopped drinking the caffeine I Want to talk about Martha McSally was what's your in here for anyway [laughter] so what are your\nHe's she's ah it's it's either her Christian cinema and cinnamon quite frankly some of the things that she had said in the past is you know it's it's scary ... and she says she has changed I I I just can't I just don't believe in Lebanon changes their spots that\nI I agree with you but it's not the worst of two evils to me more than ... actually a wonderful person and the right lady she is a warrior yeah for sure she well hard charger\nShe's noticed she stands on issues with the military yeah and it was a border yeah ... and she has been consistent it's not something that has she has changed your opinion over the years\nAnd she's consistent supporter of Donald Trump Donald Trump beside her and will be in town\nI'm In town in Phoenix Mesa tomorrow to have a rally\nFor Martha McSally and when the president does that these supportive because he knows and it's it's mutual\nAnd we have the vice president coming down here today today no friday friday\nWait a minute or they could both going to be the same day\nAs a rally for months have double check yeah I Know at five o'clock tomorrow vice presidents Joe Foss term yeah at five o'clock\nI thought the rally was tomorrow Mesa but it could be both I mean we HAVE QUICK transportation between him and he said\nWhether they may be both they may be miles north of exactly on her way to Mesa\nAt any rate with whatever it is the fact is that ... has been consistently for support of issues that are important to the people that are going to go in and uh\nAnd and send them has been the exact opposite now something that really surprised me the caller cold and the other day\nAnd told me that a more uh the cinema Kirsten Sinema has the endorsement of the Arizona State troopers you'll stay please which I thought well that doesn't make sense let me check it and and I think it was oh gee\nUh-huh and I said nah as oh jeez probably wrong so I started checking in I couldn't find it at first I did find that\nThey did did di di di ... not the police but the union\nMhm the police union now crust and send them his brother\nIs a policeman in Tucson\nAnd maybe that helped it or not but I just found out today that the Arizona troopers pulled their support of course and said oh\nBecause because the troopers didn't like it yeah\nThe troopers themselves called the union so what is going on\nWhat are you doing\nAnd they pulled it now that's\nThat's good how they didn't give it did they say look we're just neutral now at this point I Would just nuke but\nBut for them to give it to ... it was a surprise to me because she is not believe it was similar to\nWhat I well and of course the two major newspapers state Republican a star\nBoth ... what's the star which would support socialist\n... yeah I mean\nAnyone but cinema has been a\nFew follower career has been everything from from disrespecting Arizona shoes\nOn calling them crazies\nOut at the other sees five seasons sixties cars are crazy\nAnd then are we talking about him being a laboratory you know governmental laboratory state by state but we're the governmental laboratory they call that the governmental a meth lab yeah and not the governmental might have a government meth lab\nAnd is she has supported and some some positions that were diametrically opposed to everything that this stance for well and and now she's she's trying to paint herself is\nWell you know she doesn't say she's a Democrat she's no depending on\nWho we were not by party but by thinking I think is what she tries to a twist\nStick a phone call you're on your\nUh what's sad is that the cinema has has used those\nThe troopers and ads countless times\nAnd I'm certainly not hearing in the media that they withdrew their support\nAnd I agree with you guys there's something wrong with someone who is pretending and she's pretending that she wants to represent us when everything in those video clips I've seen shows ah disrespect for the state\nIs respect in particular for Republicans disrespect for women who choose to stay home you know and take care of their family and it just it saddens me that the media is so one sided that they don't get the\nThe truth out on a I'm Glad to see the president the vice president's coming in and the president did a rally with makes Sally and she did a really good job at that rally\nThat role he's already been done I was thinking it was yeah you know in in one this\nFriday all I've heard so far is\nFive PM but it also sounded like they were going on a tour but it'd be nice to have some facts would get out there so people would understand better what is going to happen tomorrow other than I think she and the vice president are going to be together at least at some point\nI Know they're going to be a Joe Foss you we're bored the Joe Foss hangar at five o'clock room which I Know you're also going to be at a fundraiser a ... that's put on by the Republican Party\nRight I don't know if that's before or after probably after ... um I Can't remember the time I got I got to remain in more detail\nYou'll have more details by tomorrow\nYeah I've gone on my phone somewhere I just have to look it up\n[laughter] but well\nI just told people recognize what a fraud she is 'cause she she's trying to pretend like a lot of Democrats across the country that they're independent but the truth is anybody I got to do is look at recent times they vote together in a block they've\nDecided they do not want to help Americans at all and to me that's what Trump's all about I Love President Trump because he\nSays the guy Republicans to have a little more guts and do what's right for the American people\nAnd da de ... should\nBe all of their first priority but I think all all of us are old enough to know it has not been their first priority no guys a different guy I Love that he fights\nAnd I want people that will support him and a march ... going to support him\nThis Kirsten cinemas just ... to me she's a fraud to go to taxes and to put down in Arizona like she did and those clips obscene right is just appalling and uh it it shows that she really doesn't want to represent Arizona she just wants a job\nWhere she can actually kind of messed this up [laughter] and I don't want to Arizona to be messed up it's a it's a wonderful state\nNo more than more than ... white person\nYeah she is she did the right person but\nI you know I'm hoping people are not going to be fooled because the media is unfortunately very biased even our local media\nBetter than me but there's just too much bias and they don't they can't seem to get past that they can't seem to\nJust to the facts and and uh leave their own personal beliefs out of their their reporting\nIt's part of that whole industry unfortunately ...\nYeah well needs it needs to change and I know a lot of it starts in the colleges you know with what they're teaching the kids that\nDid this come out on it but a\nFundraiser as a private event also but uh\nWell that's fine I you know I'm you know I'm just saying that uh I heard something about Fifteen hundred tickets but I don't even know if I heard that right\nUm I ... I think I wrote a thousand in another tickets are free for Joe Foss it's just it's just because you know you you can't you're looking at us doing it you know to go on\nLine and and uh ...\nYeah that's right that's right I think it would have been bright it's in there but the ... and they do the ... just for the fire marshal nobody else you're going to get so many people in their\n... and that makes sense you know you need to check\nPeople out and and uh make sure that they're going to follow rules and not cause any problems that's another thing I Love is watching these rallies\nOr you have tens of thousands of people and they all get along and they're having so much fun yeah you know I just love it\nNothing to two strands above ... barrier we'll take a break because it's already eight o'clock hour it's time to go we'll be right back and five sixty gave you you\n[noise]\n\nFrom day one hour air conditioning and heating studio this is talk five sixty K B L U Yuma [noise]\nSpecial report more bomb scares political violence is on American there is no place for it in America Republican\nSenator Ben Sasse as ten bombed device packages have now been discovered most centered prominent Democrats and supporters correspondent McGill Marquez tells us one made it to the seventh floor of a building in lower Manhattan associated with actor Robert De Niro this morning\nA quick acting security guards saw it a law enforcement officials says that the X ray the initial X ray of the package also looks like the devices that they have seen\nMorning rush hour traffic in Manhattan disrupted as the package was taken away by a bomb containment truck two more package is found in postal facilities in Delaware both addressed her former vice president Joe Biden bearing the markings and other characteristics of the others the president rejecting\nCalls his tone down his comments and stop the insults tweeting all the anger is the falls into the mainstream media he says an idea\nEchoed life ...

area that take your name is the application you're going to fill it out they were going to put you in a jump legitimate gonna fly you back to work\n... Honduras or wherever you came from the way we've got to pay for that 'cause someone's got to pay for the\nLast time it was ... voted\nRight now the way they handled went with a way that's him let's got to go before a judge is going to get to the day in court and all that kinda stuff and that's what bogs down the newly overwhelm the court system they know that you are thinking you over your over thinking I'm not overstate he'll tell me what happens now\nSo if it can be changed what you're saying if it can be and all those are gave an indication that it's possible just never been done in the history of our country where the the military could actually push them back if they tried to rush in and just you know keep them from\nDoing it they they've never done that before we've never done it all the interest\nSaying why why go through this issue people I mean I thought that would be great and we had to we have to but you know what why go through that why don't you just bring them in a sure I'm In\n... or something and ship 'em back and and take the money out of you got money is the end of their countries for foreign aid take that money and tells countries you know what you want your foreign aid keep your people\nCurrent legal system that's the only way we do it you know that I Know that and you're talking about changing it it's not a small thing to change it but I Would be in favor I'm In favor of what you're saying I'm not I'm not opposed\nThere are so many people that are against all these immigrants coming in here I I doubt that they would complain about how you change the system to send them back\nWell still have to go to a due process he's not an M. so do\nYou do you prefer that they you know he's not an imprint district your show and he's not an effort but this is giving him a provision that each you must it\nI don't think a Nineteen fifty two\nIs that your show and he's not an effort but this is giving him a provision that that's\nWhy I don't think a Nineteen fifty two does ah I think that's just about the law it's not about uh you know what what they do if they get on the border and how we treat them because they're still everybody that's in our country still gets due process whether you're a citizen non citizen league will not leave we get due process\n\nAnd I guess if you're visiting or ... or you can do to get back well are coming to visit their coming in Europe for\nI'm In favor of upholding our laws I Am I'm In favor of it and in but if there is something in the constitution that there was an emergency can be cleared that says when we're being invaded and that's the way it it is that that we can do skip all that that I'm for it\nSo and what do you what do you watch you know this is the first time this has happened we had this situation what was it a month ago where everybody was crying because there were separating families and doing all\nRight so this happened seven months ago eight months ago when it happened a few of the time going back last year or two when you say separating families oh okay\nI don't know that I'm just using that is when it happened when they were ... I'm not\n... well we've had we've had many more than last month come in the men really\nSo what what are what are we what is Congress about what are they had no other than campaigning for a job right now to get reelected what are they doing about it\nWell not enough not to go to our goals our talk to us yesterday and of course the conversations in in in the push has been going nonstop behind the scenes and then the one thing they're talking about I gosh I Wish I'd written down which article and what it is\nA you know that they'll they'll check with him today and get that's where I can have a tomorrow\nI'm says that you know they're having a lot of conversation on whether this can be enacted\nAnd and actually do what you're saying pretty much is that if they make it their foot on the soil no big deal to him right out\nNow that's never been done [noise] [noise] [noise] but it it's time maybe [laughter] maybe it's time to\nGet a second ago don't make them up over the fence open the gate let them put their foot in the soil process and the ship 'em back out that's just what I said but I guess maybe\nWell you know what I Do I think you must understand me I said I'm agreeing with you I said doing exactly what you said but it's never been done\nAnd\nI don't want to do anything that you illegal I don't want to do anything that's wrong that's going to get a caller a problem in the court systems but if there was a way that done yet and so\nIf we if we process on the ship 'em right back out and five months from now we need to be able to go by the court or do you want to do you want to send them a ticket to fight back to the United states\nYou're Joking you joke about that but if the judge says it then that's exactly what happens just like this re reuniting children with families the judge said it look a lot of those families that got separated\nThe parents were were were not allowed in the country and they should take your child would you say no we're leaving the child were taken off in a band in the trial the judge said a ... item they have to go find them in wherever they go\nAnd when they go and when they go find them and they read an item and then they can process in for ending the child and child and\nThese are no idea I don't know why they don't well I mean come on man with a neck wish they would think that I mean\nI and it's interesting to see that some of these people are turning back I mean not all of them and then I don't know how much the numbers are what's coming this way but there's seems to be a portion of them probably twenty percent or so I guess\nI think Fifteen hundred dollars lighter Fifteen hundred applied for asylum in Mexico and a man will you know that's that's all I've heard and then and then you hear that seven thousand is fourteen thousand who knows\nBut every ... every picture you see it's marching men it's not women you see some pictures of women when they stop you might not ...\nGoing to argue with you on that I I'm sure the majority probably a good Seventy eighty percent or single\nSee some pictures of women when they stop you know I'm not ...\nNot going to argue with you on that I I'm sure the majority probably of a good Seventy eighty percent or single man I'll be the rest of them at our families I don't know but I'm sure it it it's it's heavier on one side and the other sure but once again I say we have we have a problem\nAnd of course was sure water we need it but you take a stand now secure our border we talk about you and I are not a draw the line and his dad we draw a line in the sand and then we step back and we're process that we draw the line and then we were were afraid to take action\nWe were wrong we're we're not afraid to take action and I think I think president Enron even ask let me\nLet me ask you if you were in a parking lot and you saw a little old lady getting her purse taken away and would you think twice of pulling a gun and shooting that person or\nRight and that person to back off I Would definitely where we can just do it no no I Would definitely help the lady there's no question but that's different than you would at\nAnd at that moment you wouldn't think about the ramifications of what could happen to rest cart well uh after this is over right\nAt the ladies being attacked I don't have to worry about that because that's that's a\nAnd what the United States is not being attacked [laughter] let's see if they in an attack we have to still follow the rules but it's an invasion and attack\nAnd I are not disagreement were disagreement or we can just we could just Dorian ...\nBecause we'd rather have them aliens come across and being here so that we can all sit and complain you're wrong and it's a Republican problem we're wrong problem\nYou're wrong no we're not we're not at All right [laughter]\nThat's a no you're wrong if you think that's that's what I Want your long I can tell you that you're\nWrong maybe you personally don't want that but I think that's what our our our politicians want I think some do they do they want them to come in here so they can they can yell at each other I think something to know if you're doing too much but I

I understand but at the same time they're ... they're spreading all this weight and written hateful rhetoric they blame Trump for it and they'll\nAnd I'm a rally where they said you know go in take that guy you know maybe you're you're a legal fees\nWhich he met him because I was ... it was it wasn't the dirty wasn't handling them that well that's it that's that's the thing that the rent and ... and recently last week he said something about like the guy 'cause he's slim he body slammed the media guy you know it's a joke\nYou know and then just that's just Trump I mean yeah I Know it's nothing compared Russ look it's nothing compared to what these people have been doing has been impeached impeaching pinch from day one\nOasis in advocating like you said advocating don't let them eat in peace don't let them get gas oh it's it's been it's been outrageous over the top ... yes I agree it just\nYou know looking management center Mitch McConnell could Ted Cruz look at ... at at the right chicken whatever that restaurants called it you know being harassed it's been like this from day one I mean\nYou know I'm ... I mean he's kept every promise he's going against the current in Congress and look what he's been he's been able to do what he's been able to manage for the American people and the Democrats hate him so much because they can't bribe him\nThere are no kick back with this guy doesn't work for Washington like the last one did they didn't make him they can destroy All right right\nThe American people this is why they're attacking them and then you get some loony who who who who stoop to their level which kind of makes me mad 'cause he makes us all look bad in a way any sense bombs\nI I don't condone it one bit but but I Can't I Can't understand why this is happening I mean the Trump supporters are fed up the millions and millions and they didn't have those ... and then and then in those millions you have one you find one would loose nuts and then this happens and think nobody got hurt\nYeah and I I Hope they find this guy and they say guy because it's no always guy or girl but uh hopefully they find this guy and he goes to jail forever I don't care who he is on campus Republican or Democrat and been I don't care right you're going to jail for that\nBut but these dams now now I feed them like think Hillary in the Mad Max Maxine\nOh oh no why are you know\nAnd now they're blaming Trump the guilt guilty by association or this is someone from his party but the American people can see what's happening here\nThese these these whole all these ... again it is a is a fault and it's really in my opinion is full of of of of these radical left bent on taking down this president what what about these uh\nUh ... those those wackos the um\nWhich we have to we we have to take 'em down a set of senator Collins what what about that that I thought that's what I was trying to remember Anthony Foxx yeah we did you hear that one member state we have to take him out how come that wasn't investigate or is that being investigated senator Collins was that white powder or they are they still investigating that I ...\nI'm assuming they are but I don't know and\nAnd and then you look and then look look look at these in my opinion the effect the Democrats like Gilliam in Florida ran against an FBI investigation or a ... in Texas attempting\nA due to flee to a hit and run a drunk driver this award ready to get that crude he's got this massive staying behind them Keith Ellison what's going on with that with\nThis ... losing Iraq's losing their both losing and that's good that's well and that's the voters and good for them and uh you know it's up to them if they want to keep them after some of those things\nBut but you see what I'm used to I mean these were Republican oh my gosh well older ...\nPossibly and I and I think they are handling never leaves Republicans and Democrats are handled differently but but the it's up to the moon and thank goodness the voters in both cases or you just mentioned\nAre not in favor of keeping them in office\nWell yeah and
