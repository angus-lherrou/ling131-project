Sally\nA debate\nI don't know if you know there was one but there is there's going to be one there was only one it was an hour long\nAnd um I I um\nGosh what do I think [laughter] I think er since animals well prepared or an image Sally\nWas well prepared for what she wanted also she's she comes out swinging in and harden and Kirsten Sinema did the only thing she\nCould do and that was to come out and looked like she was a I mean she was a done\nUp like he was going to the prom or means you you know hair was perfect everything's perfect real soft spoken\nAnd tried to live act concerned and knowing that that she could not match mix alleys roughness and mix Sally didn't back off so I probably would have asked her to back off a little bit we don't need at that point um because of course and was looking for the sympathy almost like\nA a a but at the end of the day like Sally point after point after point walks away what they're saying if people are looking at those things and she was strong gee uh you know much like her message of a working\nFighting in and she will and supporting the wall supporting the issues are important to Arizona cinema tried very hard to mask\nWhich he stands for even the Kavanaugh thing\nOh I'm disappointed in both sides and the arguments knowing that the people over all were are disappointed in in general of the senators\nI'm not getting to the point and so she never made she never answered on whether she agreed or disagree with it until well at the end when the commentator said oh by the way you'd never said that she said no\nBut she was asking for more time more investigation and we needed more information same Democrat spin\nSpiel ... delayed delayed Les um but she was not forceful on anything about stopping it does um overall I don't I think it was a non event\nUm I think it's still close and I think with Sally had six point lead in the last poll I looked at a with a with a three before that cinematic three point so it's um

country\nYeah cinema was protesting against that\n'cause she she could've been anything and you never know and purposely did and I think that's right front page of the paper this morning Sears closed and surprise anybody I think it came out\n\nThey come out Monday was it I mean I thought I rented earlier but or maybe it was Monday came out but ah they've been on the\nDecline for years I mean years they've been on the decline Sears been closing stores for a while I think they had a heyday according to his article I think two thousand twelve between K. Marts in Sears at four thousand\nNow after this new it's gonna be five hundred\nUm which but\nThey're just they're just not getting it done and I get it done the cheers organization has has really not kept up with the times not kept up with a marketing not kept up with consumers\nYou know they got some things they've done well over the years tools are appliances planes is not\nSo much anymore barely but ah with the tools they've always had a great deal great opportunities for tools I've always liked him\nUm but chapter eleven which is reorganization and bankruptcy you know when they just get a job\nYou know renegotiate everything's you know see if they can come up with a ... you know a spin off a lot of assets that are working for them and and come up with a program that's going to keep them profitable\nI don't see it happening where they're not changing they've been they've been working on this\nFor years and somebody on the inside of the newspapers morning a um\n\nTalk about him being the Amazon of the day they were big they were huge a Sears, Roebuck was top of mind um everybody's envy they owned the markets and just like Amazon today everybody knows Amazon\nHow the the market's change in business has got to keep up they do what you do you look at Twenty years ago Amazon didn't exist Walmart didn't exist and all these things have sprung up to fill a need and avoid the cheers was ignoring cheers had the opportunity to fill at all\nAnd even after Amazon gets going\nAnd they started doing the Internet simple easy\nI'm really fast and just great selections and they just do it perfectly Sears gets into it and it's horrible I tried to navigate it it's miserable I needed something from Sears and\nAnd I ended up making phone calls 'cause it just they just can't get it right and what happens is people stopped going customers decide customers decide and and this was going to be closing stick a phone call you're on the air\nOn why would you do you\nKnow uh I had to bring it up or down a little off but anyway that there are a winding down here for ...\nYes at AT Kearney club and a lot oh they're not going to have their nineties and off a neck of the day sale or anything\nApparently they are apparently they are going to start reducing prices and start clearing it out according to the paper this morning\nOh so okay I think they're looking at closing on friday I mean on friday on December December which is really weird that's the busy it's supposed to be busy now run\nYeah you're right I\nKnow a a anyway I think they filed bankruptcy and I don't have to worry about ... and all that\nKind of stuff that all on the air no that they are like that you\nKnow and what and what they're doing is that you know there's different types of bankruptcies chapter seven is when you just walk away liquidate just creditors come in take it whenever just walk away seven that's when there's no\nThere's there's no capital you know the money's gone there was no assets eleven is a reorganization basically wind forces the creditors to make to negotiate with you you know to redo contracts are reduced or send to pay off the creditors can say no and force you into a seven\nOr they can they can they can work with you and maybe we do a a lease agreement Reno electric closes store whatever um those kinds of things and are there are two different so chapter eleven is not anything to do with the taxpayers though or neither of the dilemma that has to do with the creditors\nLike like when you when you walk away from a from a a charge card if you charge or your bank card up and you walk away and and uh declare bankruptcy or the banks take the not the taxpayers\nWell well there are a predator that don't get their money\nThey write that off on their act\nThat's a normal part of business where they have bad debt and they and that's all we all kind of business but it's not\nDo that\nOn the air if if they write it off on there that I\nNot ... well [noise] in a in a sense of ... when everyone I mean most businesses set up for a certain amount of bad debt always and that's part of the businessmen platform or ...\nAnd it's part of the business you know deal in every business you you know you're going to have someone collected debt and that's basically what it comes into was collected like banks they charge Eighteen percent interest\nKnowing that um some some was going to have to be written off and it's just part of their mix so they may net ten percent which is part of the net or the mix\n'em back and they pay taxes on the on the net whatever that is okay\nPercent which is part of the net part of the mix 'em back and they pay taxes on the on the net whatever that is okay\nOkay well thank God they are economic class\n[laughter] for the call man [laughter] I\nBought that anyway yeah that'll get you to buddy take care Bye bye bye [laughter] [noise]\nYeah that that is written off but it's just part of normal business I'm In in anybody that's in business\nThat does collectibles they always have you know in a performer pope being ALS a bad debt section you know which industry standards whatever those are\nUm we had a nap auto parts was always a certain amount of and collectible that certain amount of right off the uh was unfortunately part of industry standards and\nHopefully you're better than the industry and you do write off much but you're right in essence and then it comes off your profit and so you you pay taxes on much profit at the end of the day and that you do\nUh but as far as Amazon goes and it's interesting looked at Sears was the Amazon the day and people look at Amazon is being so big and so powerful nobody will ever challenge them in in the right right now nobody can challenge um\nSame same they said about Sears till complacency comes in until you stop growing until you stop expanding until you stop looking for new ways to take your customers\nAnd then you become like Sears or for those would be a little older WTC grants if you remember grants I was a kid when they ... they were they were big at one time big stores like that but uh\nIf if management loses and you wonder why management so powerful I mean so well paid well compensated in and all that kinda stuff big CEOs or look it's a difference between Sears closing now you know down to five hundred stores or Sears taking on Amazon\nAnd say you got the right guy in there who knows or gal at this point to be either could be the one I could make it so\nUnfortunately about Sears a closing up having to see in the paper one open up there was a a flood out their mouth ... sixty on highway Ninety five\nWhen I rode the road ah ah\nYou know had a flash flood and if that happens here I've done I've driven through it before you know when they say don't you know my I saw a guy do it and he had a car I had a\nSuburban I I did not get any water inside I was fine but it's always wrong\nShouldn't do it and um I did shouldn't have don't do that you're on the air yeah\nRussia okay the morning oh gee this shutting down or shares was an ex now okay Eric call when Chrysler or declaring bankruptcy\nOh you're very well now I'm not\nOK and Obama answered Obama ... General Motors\nFor General Motors and Chrysler okay I'm thinking back to Lee Iacocca\nYou know you're you're talking Obama get screwed up you\nKnow I'm Sorry I don't mean to but but when you said ... I was thinking like cocoa 'cause that was a big success story but that was before all\nBought as anybody if there's any day now owns crash are now\nWell yeah and the yard or\nFrance or Italy Italy who I don't know\nI think God said what all of that taken out more market they you know more market is like yeah I don't see I didn't know how when they took homework\nAll the ... that's it up to the Muslim Brotherhood dishes that they should have been back story that no one is talking about a big Ozzie\nYou got meal gee I I don't know anything about and that's\nWhy I Wish I could I could burn everybody up about ... went in the long way to dig explain things to you are but nobody washed wants to talk about it they weren't just gripe about Hillary gripe about Obama\nWith the election I didn't know if that was going to be true but uh Giuliani and others were saying that and the only thing we hear now and the only recent thing is that the Trump lawyers are working on the answering questions that Mueller has given them now those are being written for him\nAnd that's the ... than I ever\nActually so we can probably expect a little blurry after the election of\nA possible way but I ... you get the impression that there is nothing there really are the other than what they've you know the thirty six people indicted most of which were Russians or a few others that have nothing to do with Russian interaction\nOr so there's really nothing narrow as far as er initial older the original uh you know venture\nTrump Trump Trump and you know Trump and and now that that out there in written form you know you get him I get the impression maybe it's really going to wrap my that's my um that\nYeah mine too and I think that the real upside is that because Trump is it having to deal with this nonstop which on every every day on the news that he's actually being able to focus on being president look what he's got done in the last two or three weeks just amazing\nYou know I didn't notice that but you're right there hasn't been I mean there's been talk of of uh the the contest coming up you know the devoting coming up to the election there's not been much else as my than some of the stuff\nHe's actually doing I ... I I you're right I guess that's what's made the change and that's been that's been done a wonderful\nThey need to shut this ... thing down well see I think we there appreciate\nIt by you know I didn't even um I didn't even pick up on that but you know we haven't been talking about Mueller much because there's nothing there have been nice\nIn it and of course even when there's nothing near that didn't mean the president talk about it continuously with nothing um it's kind of nice it's really nothing ... you're on the air\nFor morning\nOkay hello hey good morning yes right why are you doing doing well\nUm yeah yesterday a war I Believe it was yesterday when you had a uh\nThe governor of the radio yeah the governor was on yes yeah and then a a a that's a little bit on a somewhat up\nSome of the propositions correct\nYeah I'm the one that I that I uh\nI'm Still like very interested in and I didn't hear you talk about it\nWas one twenty five in a couple of weeks ago uh somebody and I believe he was somebody from from where I work for that call you a kind of like a you know a sort of like I keep a shout out like that I kind of like what it felt to me a vote no on one twenty five\nBecause of the fact that uh I guess it it it affects\nA negative way a retirement um for certain law enforcement agents in a state law enforcement agencies right\nFor a while I was wondering if you if you if you look into it because I'm I'm you know my my uh well I'm\nVery I'm kinda I started looking into it because I like I said I Believe I worked with the individual in a ...\nAnd I want to vote I Wanna I Wanna cat time all the only way you know what I'm going to vote for it not just for the heck of it so I find that I Do I still have a\nBrief church right\nIt's one of those things where I can see how it's going to affect me that negative way because I thought four years from retirement okay then again and again like in the long run I can see how the hell\nA state\n[noise] well yeah it was a there was nothing on I mean there's nothing in if it's good for you or were you know we try read because he was rich it was very rich I'm the state of\nArizona a tremendously Richmond still has a very rich program which private business can never offered private business can offer these kinds of ah ah programs because they can't afford it and they won't they won't pay for it but\nDays which states do still in this one's rich and and what one twenty five does if I'm not mistaken his reduces the cap and none of us\nYou know cost of living goes up your retirement goes up because of the you know your retirement continues to go up year after year\nAll right the cap would be I think two percent instead of four I think it's the Big Mac and that's the basic get so it would not be good for anybody retired because who wouldn't want four percent instead of to everybody would\n... the fact the fact is now the state's looking like look it's so rich we can't afford it and they want to step back and uh you know the people would then food out there they don't get a retirement like there's nobody does Social Security isn't like there's nothing like this and that anyways looked at I've kind of stayed away from it because\nI'm so it's all what do you\nSay fool fool to what they're saying about a ... you know what they're saying that if if ah if he'd have to add we continue down the ... that we're on right now that are gonna be a a very very a very very\nBad in a well known years down the road\nWill it already is already fixed the state bad I mean the retirement program it's so expensive sometimes it's more money for the retirement than to pay for an employee\nOr because it's in debt to upside down it's not good I'm fine because we still do defined benefits and not defined contribution like the rest of the world the private businesses all gone to defined contribution for one case where you know you invest your money take your hits take your losses take your games whenever you get\n'em but still we have elected officials and a state employees that get defined benefits\nAnd a and we never know what those are going to cost in ten years and we put money aside we save it and if we don't get the right return all of a sudden we go back to the taxpayers don't have taxpayers we done all screwed up we want millions more dollars because the benefits were given these guys are much more than we anticipated\nWell right and this is this is to help taxpayers motel retirees don't retirees it's it's been tuned down to the rest of the world because right now is Richard anybody else that's what it is right\nRight now one thing before uh before I go because I Know you've got a commercial why not sure I'm a lot of people that are where I'm working at their you know they're saying or\nA no say oh no\nI'm not you know the thing though\nAll of these people are looking at it\nUm [noise]\nWhat what they're saying if you don't want to vote for a for a while but I think\nOver who knew a\nDavid David David or the or the Democrat\nOh for the for governor you mean yeah they have for\nGovernor right so that if they want because of this because of the twenty five votes for for the other guy or or you know so it's like wait a minute to Oregon Democrat because of their\nWell well the the proposition has nothing to do with the governor the governor camp defective one way or the other no matter who governor has won one too and that's why I Want it cannot be touched it you know the national I thought\nIt and I called I Want to make sure about that gotta wait a minute if it's going to require life too old for the Democrats know that it happened like oh I'm not sure I mean what does one with the other I've known him he'll vote rip off for a Republican governor [laughter] just like no one's twenty five\nIf that's what you desire because they don't affect each other in no matter who the governor is can't do anything with one twenty five it's up to the voters that's it right right\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith ... connection you'll

department stores who was a system manager with went under and he had brought up a yellow front and all of these other companies and\nI could be wrong I could be very wrong with me what happened with all of these downfall was a capitalism at its finest every aspect of it I buy it working against each other or they were the worst part um\nI mean like companies buying speculating and buying other companies that all assemble very popular ah shelling out lower volume stores so they could buy entire smaller company another state to increase market share and and as far as like a shallow front that was sold to prevent uh\nA ticket to the capital to buy stock back from a employees and other people\nTo hold off a hostile takeover a same with Jim Crow department stores we didn't we weren't we weren't doing badly or we could have used an upgrade which they were in the middle of right when they pulled the plug 'em my store was going through a million\nDollar uh make over\nAnd uh I think we're better off for it\n... it didn't have black now\nWell we're making budgets I mean we're still Thin Man we don't have the rainy day funds we should and we used to have back when the ... was in

want to go back to where we start ratcheting up the cost of living in in the state of Arizona\nWe don't want to do that and uh that's what would happen with a changing governor would be ratcheted up the cost of living\nAnd a more taxes it would not be good\nWell the only thing I got if they if they go on Arizona the ape and the black vote that they\nAre pretty she ate it and you write\nAn avid

honeymoon\nBought the hotel yeah on on on napkins in the bar at the hotel they made a deal for the you know Thirteen thousand dollars a year in ... leasing\nAnd they didn't even speak the language I guess I got somebody to translate to figure out what they were doing ended up\nAh forty thousand dollars for the first three years when it's a seven bedroom B. and B. basically hotel\nA bed and breakfast type dog type stuff so they just kept drinking and then then the the the the they find out that ah\nScared all of a sudden you know when you're sober up and you realize I just bought a has brought up a being be out on the beach in Sri Lanka\nOn my honeymoon we're kind of broke\nI don't have much money and I just found out my new wife pregnant [laughter] so they didn't know what to do

the Saudi constantly while he was in Turkey\nAnd they write and they think they think he was chopped up and hold way um and of course not the case may be going out the back door that\nI yeah there was there was a there was all the Saudis have made threats that if the United states gets involved that they'll retaliate against the United states and a turkey is not happy so yeah Pompeo went to went to Saudi today to meet with king Solomon you know so\nHe's already ... well that that idea maybe things up well anyway ... ... it's like\nIt's a legitimate and it's a legitimate concern is is um and it's one that we need to handle carefully and but there's a lot in Congress and I think the Saudis are bad actors and we should do something and and there's even some anti Trump or is it would want to cause complications for Trump they may highlight it but I don't know\n... like yeah that's that's that's going on\nYeah anyway you thank you Bye bye\nYou know since she brought my tension doing oh well I'll tell you a little bit more about him up on patios already there and these walk and she has a picture of him walking with king Solomon\nTalking about the disappearance of this writer and uh they've offered to the Saudis have offered to go in and uh allow inspectors into the uh the consulate there in Turkey which is already happened by the way I but of course Monday\nAccording to the Washington Post there was a Turkish forensic team that arrived\nI but of course Monday according to the Washington Post there was a Turkish forensic team that arrived I mean before they arrived they they there was a cleaning crew that arrive\nOr so there's the suspect that if there was anything that there was a cleaning crew that arrived with bleach and everything else to clean everything up\nAnd to make sure that nothing was found but the the the what they did a lot with turkey Turkey's forensic team in a to look the place over to see if crime has been committed to see if there was a somebody chopped up and hold out the back door a\nTerrible deal especially when you get threats from the Saudis that we should stay out of it and there should not be any problems and then It's MORNING I was watching um one of the senators talking that you know we need to put sanctions against Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is a friend in the area to\nOf course we can't have friends that are chopping up journalist\nDon't we don't like Donald Trump chop up journalist [laughter] we don't I mean he may chop 'em up it would be tweeting but not physically you can tweet about him but\nAh but there are there are escalation in intentions and Mike Pompeo's over there to try to reduce that and figure out what needs to be done and and as a government behind this or as as are bad players coming from the kingdom\nAnd um and and I'm sure we'll find out some pretty quickly I guess I guess because of the tensions on it and then and the demand that uh you know there are some\nYou know some transparency on what the heck's going on and and that kinda stuff\nBut that those kind of acts happen all the time in some countries unfortunately not not condoning them and and you know you don't get the kind of press but because the Saudis connection to the United states I guess there's a higher bar\nThey because they are they our friend in the area and they shouldn't be murdering people when they're counseling you should fight people in the ... and and use the bones are cut them up and take a back door and those are rumors haven't been proven and the forensic team went in there to figure it all out but um\nUm we'll see if this thing comes down if there are some\nUm something reached that satisfies all parties\nBut they um\n[noise] there's a Augie was critical about the Saudi program prop crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon and ah there is some suggestion that\nAs the crown prince was behind it and he's the next in three in line for the throne\nAnd uh\nThat's a that's not good that's not good\nAt something that something is good Hyundai of human that have mentioned them to David Hyundai of Yuma\nThey're out there um you know they're out there on three seconds or you can drive by and when you drive by you can see the Hyundai sign and see bench trucks out there on the front now the trucks are not ... it may be confusing to you but it shouldn't be because look it's one day if you want to take care of transportation needs view um Arizona\nYuma, Arizona a lotta people like going out of the desert they like trucks they like hauling fifth wheels whatever it is but one day of uber has a great of sort\nOf vehicles that you may want they're outside the home they line they're setting right up there in front some of them\nOr take a look at those and you may be surprised they want all year they want to fulfill all your needs or even if it is a a a pre own vehicle and they want you to get on Craig's list and and take a look at a\nAnd now that they have some decent policies in tax cuts and whatever they are the only person that suffering or the other people and the Democrats because they're not going to do well in three weeks if the economy and roaring ... four point too so they gotta fill the brakes on it\nSo that we have so much down days on the guy on the stock market and what have you done it that it'll take a talking point away at least somewhat yeah from public and so I think you are right on the money\nMight be right or we don't know we'll see what goes on ... she had to call thanks Bye bye bye I'm On this DNA thing with Elizabeth Warren in and the reason it's even important it was it was hurt a broad enough\nThat she's Indian in fact she\nYou know ... and the Harvard or you did some are listed in in er in in a school that she was of Indian descent and all that kinda stuff which gave her minority status for whatever reason it may be able to gain entry\nI'm\nShe misused and she has no windy and you know point zero nine percent is not Indian and she's not gonna be classified as Indian and I guess to George Braun is going to\nShe's not a member of a tribe and apparently never never attended any Indian or groups and all and there were there were some available that you just never participated in even though\nShe was a listed and receive some advantages of being a part of minority that she's not if she's part of it than we are more\nAnd minority which would be would be ridiculous second phone call you on the air\nAnd make\nMorning and not just a thought I changed our president say if she were cake cast it ... ... than it is that if you take it cast ... is in box I thank you got\nThem out and do corner on that because back she took the cast I think I should just get than I Am not to charity like promise to and that would really put him above the crap\n\n... in in the ... we'll see but I appreciate\nA you know ...\nYour your your your ah your viewpoint on it was it not a good point that actually ways than will anyone I and I got to go back in ... I got to go back and look at it in and see because you'd be bringing a question in my mind I thought I thought it was if she she was Indian or\nHow he said he said I'll pay for looking at it get in a test I gave you a million bucks that's what he said that's all they said\nWell I I Will go back and verify that I'll take a look I I find that interesting appreciate the call\nI thanks man but and I um\nI don't know but I thought it was a million bucks if she was Indian but I ... I don't remember I definitely go back and ah um\n[laughter] ... what he he said he probably tweeted it should be easy to find it should be easy to get out there on all that kind of stuff\nUm you know Americans get a majority of Americans agree to anything is is not been easy in recent years it's not we can't get a majority I'm I'll tell you what we can get a majority Americans degree on by the after this phone call you're on the air\nAll right hey good morning where's the\nWith the test is in Elizabeth Warren's hands only but I Believe her when she says it because it's nothing to be proud of\nWell that's nice do you believe that but without proof yeah buddies you know going in and saying well he said that that that\nThe ... the purpose of the conversation as\nShe got a job at Harvard for being of color correct and so splitting hairs with ... what all the other a lot of times we say or ingest certain things and not to be taken literally right but anyway\nWhat does it relate thank you sir figure and and the question I Would go to the point zero nine percent maker Indian I think not I mean so that just is known to be proud of but I think he's right you know\nWe shall see a copy of it and see what it is maybe it is hey the thing that Americans all agree on sixty percent of Americans clean they've seen ghost\nThat's a weird study but sixty percent okay I can go on the records have never seen that goes to my knowledge I I've been out with a ghost hunters when they came to human that time I went out with them and they were talking like there were ghosts and ... but I never saw one\nA new study two thousand people found the most beautiful strong connection the paranormal\n\nForty percent of the people think their pet seen one too I have no idea 'cause I never had that conversation with my pet like a phone call you're on the air\nThe ... are you doing well good morning [noise]\nYou had to add to our\nShow I did and you guys are talking about uh her I'm sure how they didn't take it away [noise] this eight kept them not only from our county just I guess\nYeah pretty pretty big amount of money I imagine\nLike over the years a billion dollars yeah\nUh-huh and uh I'm listening to all these commercials or or running for governor governor\nDC and ... Garcia and they talk about how David Garcia doesn't have a plan for education and yet he claims to be a journalist every now and how will get the governor these gases planning\nAll that and so our state really it's been\nOperating and getting all the true to what they're doing but typically the reason why they're successful because they've been robbing from Peter to pay Paul I guess\nWell yeah the or the state has been um\nAnd I guess they have called in today on ... ... member would do she took over and we'd like three billion dollars in debt or something so yeah yeah so there has been there hasn't been a lot of robbing Peter to pay for all I mean I had to\nYeah of course we know that a lot of the problem to put our state in the tailspin was it that are by a truck or a car that runs on propane and what the ten thousand dollar\nThat that rent it there was such a minor issue that was not would put his was it it\nIt really wasn't minor it costs they quite a bit of money\nI'm I'm Talking billions of dollars it didn't it didn't cause that much believe me there were more more going on than that\nWell it started it and and but ... won't even a threat to the site Oklahoma's chains of a billion dollars in it than coming in from money that should've been\nThat wasn't handled properly or miss appropriated if you will I mean\nI guess you have to do when you try to compare one governor got to eat it governor who has been robbing Peter to pay Paul are allowed it to happen without saying anything about it because he is the governor right\nWell I I think we've been talking about it for the last number of years on what we've done to I guess\nI'm just tired of hearing all the negative commercials from both sides I'm not saying it's OK one by the negative commercials it'd be kinda irritating time you know it's kinda like the kettle calling a potluck\nOkay just uh yeah\nHockey's stayed at someone's not gonna do something and they haven't been given the opportunity yet whether they're all one side of the party or the other side of the party\nWell we can just you know we can only talk about what their promises focus and histories army I guess those are generic some basics but I mean we knew what he was going to say we would cut taxes and not raise them and he's done just that so he was you know kind of true to form\nA well yeah but if you got her money sitting there I mean it's pretty easy to make that statement and then go ahead and come to that when you got money coming in on the back door I guess in a sense\nRight well he balanced he balanced we need to do without raising taxes and and I I guess there's choices to make the they could have done the same thing and gone to the taxpayers and say we knew another three billion move to raise your taxes and I think that would have deployed what he said\nHey I'm going to use I'm going to use your money to balance the budget\nThat was a ... her money didn't\nIt would've been nice to be honest about it they were using your money so that way we can balance the budget\nNot when you say when you say honest everything was transparent was nothing hidden and believe me it was I don't believe in every day\nThey've been telling us that they're using our money for this and that it does yes okay okay we're talking about what you will not read the newspaper that day I get well\nAnd as a county supervisor we actively worked on that issue all the time we talked about it all the time it was on I always\nI'm always ... they can't our local county and I look like they're supposed to talk about it but I've never heard this date tell anybody oh yeah what were you in that we don't like\nOh yes I haven't heard that comment they ah maybe I'm reading\nAnd believe me okay and the interesting\nThing I Would study a reporter I'm always looking for him all of a sudden well\nWe had a a an inch and interrogation of course I guess they still got to wait for all the fact that come out but when I understand somebody know that he did it for a week and all of it and we go in there and investigation or just don't want to go\nIn and we don't really have a lot to do with it except that its allies of ours but yeah it's it was the Saudis on Turkish oil you know actually in the consulate in Turkey and Saudi constantly um but I think that I think they knew he's been dead for a week I mean that was the suspect is that he's been dead\nUm yeah I just take it just takes somebody walking in the interrogation\nThat sure no well I guess I I guess we'll have to wait and see a play that it'll be interesting well and and I I a lowly level it'll be interesting yeah the thing\nLike Beckham five sixty Gabriel you\nBack with the Gulf show [noise]\n\nFrom the ... our air conditioning and

that was the last month yeah what's going on [laughter] was last [laughter] okay well I needed to bring it up I don't want to ruin your parade\nCan good Tuesday Morning and welcome back to the desert southwest cop show five sixty am cable you and our guest this morning in which the teenager Henry is the director of education or for the PGA professional management program at New Mexico State University\nAnd a a Henry welcome and this morning we are talking about how we learn and why is that a short important and rewrite before the break um [noise]\nWe were talking about an imprint observing how they're learning how their father imitating and putting all of that into memory and you had a thought about that yet\nSo when we when we talk about memory and recalling information and we're doing through pictures um it's been interesting watching my four year old she's in preschool and she's learning how to write\nAnd went learning how to write she's ... she's had to develop a mental image imagery bank of the letters of the alphabet ... when she goes to write the letter she has to recall the image you dinner head mhm\nAnd she's able to write them to the ability that she can remember them every now and then she'll get\nConfused as to what the letter looks like for example she comes and gets a cute looks like she doesn't use it very often and so she forgets that one looks like or the key and she asked me mom or dad what he looked like and so with our finger in the air we draw\nThe letter for and then she remembers and then she can put it back on the paper we basically have reminded her of the picture so that she can use it in order to write the letter on the paper\nSure sure that's why you can go ahead I'm Sorry please\n... and ... and it's interesting because with every repetition of remembering the pitcher send signals to her muscles to coordinate the action and the wedge ability of the writing improved with each repetition\nOf course of course\nWhy they use flash cards I don't take to use them anymore but that's why they use flash cards and education for years and years and years and years and years and years um it was you know to form a picture which seven times for looks like and what it is\nYeah it was you know to form a picture what seven times for looks like and what it is\nAnd uh yeah it's so\nWe end this is a very very simple overview and and I don't want to get into the scientific\nArea of how we learn because I don't want to talk over we're anybody's head or get people confused including myself [laughter] but uh\nIf we look at it in a very simplistic way that's how we learn everything\nIt doesn't matter what it is\nAnd Russia was having a we were having an interesting conversation off the air where are you saying that you know we learning comes from our five senses she feel taste touch and smell\nAnd ah so you can kind of corporate debt into yeah you can be in different situations and you can remember a variety of different things about that situation and you might remember\n... older or sent him where you were you might remember a certain feeling that you have of a panic or of serenity you know one of the other uh you know like a safe feeling a comfortable feeling versus a\nAh we remember restaurant by the taste smell yeah there's certain things or service all those things but it's it's it's um and we're ... the main picture the bill [laughter] that's the serenity feeling going around [laughter] but no you're right you know and uh\nUh you know we're we're affected by that when we walk into a supermarket very first thing we do and we walked into a supermarket of it has kind of an older or a or a strange\nSmell through and it's I don't know about [laughter] we're not getting the fresh vegetables [laughter] no but it's very interesting so now we're gonna take that\nAnd we're going to apply it to a golf lessons\nOr we're going to apply it to a golfer that might be standing in front of us and and asking us questions in relationship to golf swing\nA I Want to learn to play golf all these different things we hear a as as GOP instructors GOP coaches kept teachers\nUm take it from there\nSure are relating it back to the child learning to write\n'em when learning to right we are observing and learning the intended movement of the pen or pencil that tool in golf learning to bring a golf club we should be learning the intended most motion of the golf club\nWe shouldn't be observing what the golf club is doing\nAnd then mimicking it's action\nOK okay problem with that though is that the Gulf loop so quickly that it's very difficult there\nMhm um\nOne reason why we should start with partying and shipping and the smaller strings because of the club ... movie\nLower and we demonstrated to our players and they deserve it and we can kind of do a back and forth exchange that they learn effectively\nYeah OK\nYou you see when you said something like that I Want to interject here for our listeners it's a very very important to remember and we use the example yeah I just started this program of a infant\nYou know once you're able to hold themselves up in a sitting position is learning how to use a a fork in the ... years learning how to use in the chat utensils\nWants you to bear in mind that it probably takes said infant six to eight months abusing utensils minimum three\nTo four times a day to become somewhat proficient at it and go ahead\n... great point um we often\nForget that timeframe involved in learning a\nUm whether a player you to the game or in advance where learning and he's still are making an investment to be able to you and the golf club you got to take a little bit of time we need to be able to process the information and then be able to practice to get proficient\nAt home and that's\nOne reason why starting from the from piling in shipping and moving backwards it's going to be most valuable\nAll right I Would agree with that I Would agree so environmental learned your shoe free throws\nA\nRope I'm going to learn how to throw a ball in a in a wastebasket from five feet and from ten feet in from Fifteen feet than from twenty feet than from twenty five feet them from to repeat it it's going to take some time and it's going to take some practice but\nIn golf unlike basketball which is a very define sport or\nThrowing the ball into a basket which is a very defined\nMovement\nWe had the ball where you have the basket therefore the basket is the goal there for the ... the the basket is the target putting golf we have this great ... pantsuit area out there in front of us and we forget about target\n\nHenry [noise] yeah we do forget about the target um\nIt's quite interesting I Wonder if you know if we lined up on our golfers and ask them what the target was\nI have no idea\nIt's easy to understand all the confusion in in people learning how to play golf and why it's so frustrating for them to learn how to play golf and NY when they finally learned how to hit a ball in the year they never get good at playing golf because they never learned how\nTo play golf would you agree with that\nAbsolutely it's probably the biggest reason why people have a difficult time going from the practice the to the first ... on the first the all of a sudden we have a target\nWe shouldn't have but\nWe should have a target or we we should have our we're going to have a consequence correct\nYou might get lucky you might get lucky\nI mean how many people you see they start out and go par par and they think well you know little Johnny is going to do really well today and pretty soon is double bogey triple bogey double bogey Trump or gay and little Johnny comes in and she was she is fifty five for nine holes just like he does every week\nAnd nobody can figure that out why and because of Johnny doesn't know how to play golf or giant knows how to swim in a club and hit a God Paul but he has no clue how to play golf and golf as a game of her life is a game of targets\nEverything we do in life is it has a target at titan attached to it I don't care if it's retirement getting your child through college getting your child through high school and getting your you know getting your your child to play a little league getting ... ... what ... years you know\nYou and your your your spouse trying to workout\nDisagreements in trying to work hard situations together so it it makes the whole family a better stronger more caring unit his targets targets targets everything's at target\nBut when we play golf we don't have it does\nAny thoughts on that and\nIt's just interesting to hear you speak of it in those terms because we do operate that's there you know with the end in mind we we operate with a target and engulf maybe it's fair to say that we don't have a target because maybe golfers do maybe it is the ball\nBut it's just the wrong a target it doesn't produce the results that they're looking for\nCorrect when we're cutting targeted\nTo rule the ball on our line as far as the whole parental role the ball into the whole\nUm that's the objective\nAnd the further we get from that in terms of the longer that distance shot it can be played the more people start obsessing with hitting the ball just making contact\nMhm [noise] I Would agree I Would agree and all of a sudden so there there there can be a primary target but there's also a secondary target which is a ... and when I'm teaching someone to hit a dry and green I have a secondary target in the primary to her\nChildren are but\nI I understand what you're saying and and I agree with that wholeheartedly that too often more often than not the ball is the target and that's not what the purpose of a screen motion is\nAnd the ball in a swing emotion just kitchen away or whatever else is setting at the bottom of the circle\nWould get no way I don't care if it's a blades of grass if it's a yeah but it's an old given laying on the ground up it's a gum wrapper at your doesn't matter what it is it it's getting in the way\n\nThe golf game where we don't have the ball in our hand\nIt's similar to a football field goal kicker ticket they'll go soccer player um the football players looking at the ball but are you thinking of where he wants to spend the bowl which is to the field goal\nMhm same is true for the soccer player you're looking at the ball thinking of the target ... even which quadrant of the goals that he or she wants to go in\nMhm NHL Hockey players they say mhm the golfers should\nBe looking towards the ball but so focused on that part yet through memory\nFocusing on swinging the club I target that he or she almost become oblivious to the ball itself\nMhm I Would agree with Dan hockey would be a great example uh when you talk about a target and you think about the upper right hand or left hand corner or the lower writing under left hand corner of the net and the size of a puck how small and help per se that target actually gets\nHow tight at that target gets and I wish golfers had tighter target ... when when they're learning how to play golf I think that it would be very very helpful\nThis dream is not
