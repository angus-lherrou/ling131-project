[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd you think the key thing\nTo me and\n\nMcCarthy Andy Andy McCarthy he's a former U.S attorney said that Trump is right on the substance of what he said he's wrong I because you don't think the executive would work\nBut but he's right on the subject I don't know why is the executive order doesn't work because um the whole situation is is the misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment what it was meant to do a versus the way that it's been treated over the years\nAnd I think if a Trump doesn't executive or it's going to go to the Supreme Court is going to be them and that has to go through an interpreter because it'll it'll go to ... ... it'll it'll be challenged in court as soon as Trump puts it on paper long\nIt's going to be as we are taken right to the Supreme Court which is where it needs to be now McCarthy says he does not believe that Trump would be able to use an executive order on this critical issue in Congress would have to act when\nCongress doesn't need to act if if I'm In correct me if I'm wrong but if if the fourteenth amendment was already written and we've just been handling it wrong but if you don't need to change it then you don't need it acted anything other than say start enforcing it the way it was intended\nAnd of course then it goes in and to appeal new it'll be before the United States Congress\nOr Trump said the other day I was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment ... about the citizenship guess what you don't there's only one country in the word will person comes in as a baby in the babies essentially system in the United states with all those benefits just ridiculous and has to end and that created a lot\nOf a ... a lot of of\nYou know criticism on CNN MSNBC um and then just to to just over the top stick a phone call you're on the air\nA monitor Ralph how're you doing do welcome morning or the nice money incidents like his aspirin a day of how much money with the taxpayers day we got rid of the anchor baby ...\nI I don't know if they're if someone's ... will do it but I'm millions and millions of dollars millions of dollars and it's just and

know handouts from them from the United states government\nOn your right and what they're trying to do is make me feel bad but I see the cable on TV and the little kids is that they're trying to work and my my good hearted spraying and whatever on a\nColumn and made me feel bad for these people sure but I don't know you know I Am more interested in taking my tax dollars and improving my town if I Do not want to take my tax\nDollar for improved that many way of life that they don't have to work anymore that they live up to cover\nThese caravans are not what they're being portrayed as the courts are portrayed him as just families with children mostly women a children's all why it's mostly like eighty Ninety percent you know military age men\nThat tried to talk about a way to invade a country\nAnd maybe I Would like maybe a proud\nDemocrat to get away to come on and and tell me why that we should not put the military down on the border and string a little wire say that\n[laughter] well\nI well we can't yeah but we could sure put up a wall if we get that all funded in er and then you put a thirty foot wall out there and that's gonna that's going to force them into the ports of entry and that's the way they can we can we can control it\nAnd now there's one one rule it is against the law I mean the United states across the border you have kids down through the port events the minute you step across that border you are breaking the law and and and you have no right\n[noise] we certainly have been handled All right back we and we certainly haven't handled like them right\nPack stuff we just catch and release come see a judge in a couple of years but they never they just ...\nWell you know how how how stupid can you be to have a program like that\nWell in it and it's advertised down in South America\nYou know there's people you know get these rallies caravans together that educates will\nLet them know Marshfield paid ... ...\n... ... well they well they will do this to make money\nLet them know more skills paid ... ...\n... ... people they well they will do in the ass to make money to bring all these people in the United states thanking they're doing better for the country\nWell they're not they're not no\nI appreciate the call my friend and I say one more thing you've got to tell me I I watched that\nA great that movie at a video and kissing Santa Monica\nYeah wow man made you know where she\nWas that he was down ... cattle family preaching\nRight [laughter] well and she's ... but she was speaking reminds you speaking truth which you'd normally doesn't do out on the campaign drone and he was talking very negative about my state\nThat's right that's why I say she down at the ... cattle company trying\nTo make me thank you get the rose garden in Miami to drink the Kool Aid now I'm not going to get it\nYeah and even a rash they get buddy take your mind and on this a citizenship thing a Trump said there's not another one in the in the you know in the country that does it or in the world um there has been apparently Australia Ireland France and India used student and they stopped it\nUm\nThey repealed it and it and it says there's other country I don't have a list you know I don't I don't know who they are I guess I could find out let's take a phone call you on the air\nIn the morning I just got a call and the other day uh you're talking about the wall there I Am definitely\nPro enforcement but uh I Would just point out that people they walk two or three thousand miles\nOr go to jump the wall and they claim amnesty so I think that might be better spent on a little a detention space would you put people who break the law in jail than they were breaking the law well\nThe uh the wall his work in areas that they put them in a we don't need as much attention space if they just don't get in but uh I Know what you're saying\nBut uh when we\nUse it when we when the country decided to work on the human sector and they reduced the amount of incursions my like Ninety six percent Ninety seven percent\nWell part of part of it was a barrier you know the wall and we don't even have a greater one that was part of that and it was part of it so it is it is a system that the border patrol says works in the right areas and ah yeah I don't want to give up on\nWell yeah uh yeah a lot of that while you're talking about this vehicle barricades and stuff like that but\nIn this area of some of them announce all\nSomething that move those people to a different sector is a huge buildup and personnel that you know yeah\nThat was part of it and part of the dogs out here and\nThere was like you know are forty man stationed in you know and a few years we were up around two hundred and fifty or three hundred so oh yeah\n[noise] yeah there was a it was a combination of things as well as the lawn for I mean the June the courts working with them and everything and we just became an area that nobody wanted to sneak into sneak into these other areas because it's too difficult\nYeah yeah I I mean I agree I just ah when people can uh you know\nGet past the barrier or get an obstacle and then claim asylum political asylum or whatever that stuff you know well\nWell what do you think about what do you think about Trump's new news comment that says they're not going to do catch and release will build ten cities everywhere if we have to\nWell I mean yeah we used we used to a dream about that you know back\nWhen I was at a border patrol a that's a good idea because I mean we all know that ah that'll be in the Supreme Court and everywhere else though but uh I think I think it can be done you just got to have the political will to do it you know\nAll right but you do have a sponsor today does your belly

found\nBut he doesn't want any more of it after\nYou know we made that pretty clear I'm not running this now they don't do it for the two years\nAnd uh God Bless them and you need somebody knows what he's getting into the ... when he retired from anyone right back in ...\nAppreciate appreciate the call my friend alright alright but by the uh\nPours more thirty million dollars into fight against prop one twenty seven now some see it as a negative like abs is doing it too and rich\nBecause one twenty seven would put more money into solar well not really the case because abs is a a\nThat's controlled by the corporation commission they're going to make how much money that the commission tells them they can make a and if solar\nIf the if this one twenty seven passages and they have to put in fifty percent solar amount and believe me a pie as makes money on that too\nAs you know they put in a lot of the plants they have to run the power lines but the amount of expense that they would have to go and they know it would hurt every everybody that uses any kind of energy in this state would be hammered atheist sees that they know that\nAre so they're put in thirty million dollars in to fight against proposition one twenty seven and if anything it's time it's Tom ... the billionaire they got this whole thing started wants to turn us into California and California has been ah doing the propositions or the push to put more solar in and it's cost them\nYou know their rights being as climate three times more than the average\nBecause they the infrastructure can't take can't take fifty percent I'm of a\nAlternative sources renewable resource a renewable energy such as I'm that way it's gotta be redesigned in analog things has to be designed to stop and been invented yet like storage capacity and stuff\nWe don't even have it um and for us to mandate that we're going to have fifty percent [noise] my twenty thirty is\nIs crazy now right now there is only the corporation commission mandated Fifteen Percent by twenty twenty five which is what they're currently working on an even that is tough\nWith the infrastructure of the prop one twenty seven is really dangerous if you care about what you pay in energy bills you have to care about that energy bill\nYou're in trouble if it passes because it's going to affect us greatly in effect is pretty fast it's not going to take any time [noise] special counsel notified the FBI of alleged scheme to pay women for false allegations against Mueller now that's that's the Robert Mueller is the investigator Robert Mueller\nIs

activists\nA talk show host and activists\nAnd according to the Atlantic builders offers a scheme was brought to its attention by journalist from the Atlantic after a woman told him she had been offered twenty thousand dollars there's twenty thousand dollars I was you have to do is uh accuse Robert Mueller that\nUh you know he did something improper just doesn't sound\nPlausible mean that would never work just just like just like cabinet never worked a ...

I think it would I wouldn't know\nIt wasn't going to mean a lot because I didn't know I didn't know the legalities of it and I said I'd have to check\nIt's ironic the timing of it but nonetheless it's something that needs to be looked at and and done I Am and I'm telling you right now when\nPeople start coming across the border kick their names given that application get the email address and her smartphone phone number 'cause I'm sure they all have a smartphone cinema and put them on a plane and fly 'em down well\nWhat they're talking about well not fishing or not catching in releasing that only works when you're when that fish but what they're\nWhat they're talking about right now is put them in tent cities they still don't and they still haven't haven't seen them today you can't they haven't seen them then you to take him to send them back home yet I I can see a but of course\nIn a in a corral thing and send them back last year process don't\nWhoa yeah once you process that you can\nBuild a plane don't catch and release were not fishing anymore\n[noise] well I'm I'm I'm all for it and uh we'll see if it works because there's not been done and the Trump does a a you know does you know ones can end up in the courts you know the the Democrats are going to like it they're going to fight him on it\nYou know what they start thinking the negative and let's start thinking forward I mean like\nNo no you let it go look we need to be prepared for it we know what's gonna happen no no not all were preparing for our\nPoliticians are prepared for it I think when you're prepared you are already stand up there you what you don't wait till the last minute you start putting your things and you know they they managed by crisis but I guess maybe that's how the government used to manage the\nI think they're planning I don't think it's crisis I think the\nTrump opening planning they're all campaigning call it what it is [laughter] I Do both sides are busy campaigning I call it was like yeah I'm about America I\nCall would I see and I see it differently than you because I think they do care\nDo you see I'm working and put together and generally working on a plan right now who you know you don't meet our politicians deal then jointly working\nJointly you mean what am I ...

... walk me through what that means a war that support absolutely so I'm On in\nThe first week of February we will be visited\nSo I'm On in February the first week of February we will be visited by a team from the higher learning commission that's are crediting body and uh this could not be a bigger deal in that um this happens once a decade um so the they were last here ten ten years ago and\nAnd uh the accreditation is a of the most important for a number of reasons one it allows us to distribute federal financial aid and which are the majority of our students are dependent on to finance their higher education\nIt also a verifies that the validity of our credit which allows for transfer ability to to universities and whatnot so um so the accreditation process is is of critical importance to the college\nAnd uh as part of that process there is something that's called a third party comment\nAnd um what this entails is and and the folks from the community\nUh sharing their thoughts with the higher learning commission and their thoughts about the college or the role it plays in the community the value that it brings to the community their interactions with the college it's response of ... to a evolving and emerging community needs um\nAnd this gives the visiting team or a sense as to how the the colleges thought of in the communities the multiple communities that it serves\nSo this period for third party comment is open a right now it's open through a well just today a October thirty versus the last day that a common can be comments can be submitted\nAnd so if any of your listeners would like to share their thoughts or with the higher learning commission there's a link directly from the college's Web page where they can uh again it can be just a few sentences it it need not be in in fact you're limited as to how long it can be but\nBoy I Would I Would love for folks to share um the value that they feel the college brings to their life and their community or with the higher learning commission\nAnd this is the worst or edu correct\nI knew that I I just off the top of my cooking at those as easy western\nDot edu and very ... and here's what we use words were important they want information from\nPlane individuals such as myself and talks for me you brought the college closer to the students\nUm as it relates to uh getting back ... degrees as relates to the stepping stone to uh the U. of a or to you and now here's you the\nCollege going rate in San Luis what a huge huge victory ... if you could explain to listeners what that is what that means and how that happened 'cause it's it it it's a stroke is magic\nIt really magic dot your car could probably recite these statistics better than I could I mean basically we beat 'em are pure colleges in the state and frankly we beat the national average for college going rate in our county um\nAnd and one of the great things about that is um you know we had a campus that's located right next door to Santa Fe high school we had a campus that's located right next to heal the rich high school and so we have a great advantage with geography other community colleges have frankly have situation similar to that\nWe had a great outreach we work regularly our faculty with high school faculty were exploring we do a lot of business deal credit on concurrent credit there's little distinction there right students might be taken a college class and be earning high school credit for it or they might just be coming to the college to take a high school class I mean it's a college class\nAnd then they were the credit for that so um [noise] helped me out here yeah only ...\nIt John my our primary goal or one of our primary goals is at the college is to create a college going\nYeah absolutely and John my our primary goal or one of our primary goals is at the college is to create a college going culture of among the the youth and the community so we serve as part of the strategic planning the one thing we haven't talked about is we created a ... a big hairy audacious goal of doubling\nOr the rate of baccalaureate attainment among adults in in in the\nLa ... to do that we have to create this college going culture and we are doing just that everything we can\nUh very aggressively to to uh to create just that that culture\nTwenty five dollars a credit hour for for students under the age of Eighteen huge huge fan of it and I don't know how many people know but right now we have in Arizona western college English faculty member in bed at ... high school teaching\nAt ... high school during the day for those for those kids who might be challenged by transportation or might not be able to take a class after school because they're working or watching a sibling or playing sports\nWe we are reaching out to the high schools partnering Gina Thompson superintendent is a wonderful partner\nDoing incredible things I'm\nLori mentioned dual credit where they can take a class in high school during the high school day by qualified instructor and receive dual credit ... high school and college credit\nJohn we know that when a high school student successfully completes to college level courses\nIs inevitable logo to college and they will earn a credential at a much higher rate than those who did not have that early college experience this is a huge focus of the college we're reaching out to the high schools we want to blow that line between high school and college and make\nA college going activity inevitable as it is in so many communities it needs to be inevitable in our community the last thing I'll mention as\nMany students come to us in need of developmental work while they'll need a class before they can take a college level course some course worked before they're ready for college level course where\nWe want to do that developmental education in high school right and we're partnering down in St Louis to do just from that now those folks who test\nBelow college level in mathematics or a mediating that deficiency during their senior year\nSo when they graduate they are college ready and ready to move on to the University College of their choice with the skills they'll need to succeeds right away without spending time money or financial aid on developmental level work its revolutionary no one else in the state of Arizona is doing that John we're doing it at Arizona western college\nAnd the humidity embraced the idea they didn't for parents as you can't do that here you know the embraced it I'm trying to get my head wrapped around the criminal mattered or [laughter]\nI must move to a man yeah a criminal mattered or can I Know our [laughter] met a grim way of western cats on campus or a ... and and now\nUm we've had people from all anyway we\nWant to honor those uh who've offered up the ultimate sacrifice so again agency mediation dreams dot org or call the chamber Seventy two to five six seven get your uncle your dad or your your your niece or your your aunt\nUm it's amazing to watch these people line up for these flights there no charge and um it's it's just it's a spectacle\nThe Patriot guard riders

it's awesome\nYeah each ... you should just come see once it is it's over the top the top\n... so cause the chamber if you got somebody ... have up in that flight Seventy two to five six seven All right let's talk about Arizona worst in college we were we were discussing before the break and Dr ... you're down some notes and we want to get back to those who for good place\nWell sure it it just we were talking about a college that is welcoming and to our students so I Would be remiss if I didn't drop in what would we got some great coverage and are they the human son last week a\nWith a and R retention rate\nOf the ten community college districts in the state of Arizona Arizona western college has the highest the best retention rate both fall to fall and fall to spring meaning when a student roles with us in in the fall are they still with us the next fall\nTops in the state when they enroll with us in the fall they with us the next semester in the spring tops in the state\nWill that has to do with with really wonderful caring and attentive faculty it has to do with with very supportive as students services making sure they have the financial aid in the advising and they're connected in terms of clubs and activities\nBut it also has to do with place and the power of place is a day welcoming place um and we listen\nThese are hanging out places they wanted to be able to let like all of us charge their phones so we set up a solar benches around campus where they can where they can plug their phone in a and\nA that extends to our campus down in San Luis to wear a wonderful campus or directly or you know next to the high school\nBut lacked a really a a nice place to hang out in between classes or maybe while you're waiting for a ride or whatever else\nI'm so we created through this innovation fund once again or the San Luis home away from home a outdoor seating ministers are microwaves to to to heat up food just a really nice place for folks to hang out\nSocialize it's those type connections that are just as important as the students services and the faculty and it completes the experience\nAnd the students have been responding so favorably to this and I don't know where we go from here we're tops in the state but we still want to do better in terms of our our retention\nPut rude to me one of the retention rate to me why that's important too where where that's a good thing\nRight so retention rate is an indication that students are engaging in a in a valuable and consistent way with the institution and it means that they're much more likely to complete with us which is what we want we want students to come\nUm get the training or the education that they need and complete whether that means they get out of school with a certificate that makes them more valuable in the workplace more productive to their employer or they get out and they go transferred to a four year school finish a baccalaureate degree and then get out into the workforce or they seek even you know higher education beyond that so\nRetention is an indication that they're forming a valuable relationships with their faculty with their peers with the people that are helping them out on campus\nAnd we don't we don't want those people wasting their time or their money or their federal financial aid in um\nTasks that that had that don't benefit them right there has to be some value to the activity that they're doing not just for them for the district taxpayers to like we serve the taxpayers we were trying to create economic fatality\nSo that that starts with one student one family one neighborhood one community and then the two counties that we serve so that we are to get my money's worth you absolutely it's a it's an in the rising tide analogy right and so we're ... we're increasing a larger\nMore profitable tax base that benefits everybody\nAnd also the retention rate helps with your bag that's however you lose your fear yeah without that yes absolutely that is that is\nThe foundation in which the ... there is one of the ... to tame and rate is built absolutely it starts with that student who enrolls in the fall with a dream with the desire to earn a credential and if they're with us in the spring and the next fall there there that much closer to retrieve in that that that dream\nAnd for those that may have missed the first part of the show you're the ... were to be ...
