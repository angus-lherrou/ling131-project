domed in beach Trump\nAnd of course I don't think there's a consistent Democrat\nParty platform slogan they don't know where they're going I mean I think he's right I think it hurt them and keep saying impeachment Maxine Waters yep it's fine like let's take a phone call you on the air\n... good morning\nI'm calling about the event on this show ... journalist\n[noise] Oh yes yes yes yes yes\nAnd they keep they keep saying the Washington Post ... or ... whatever this guy is a journalist for a ... year sixty ever have a uh what do you call it pre laugh\nRight he was a contributor to the post not an employee's right yes right relaying right\nWhat this thing is and I I think\nIt puts Trump and I really really bad position one way or the other by a well it looks like evidence has a he was murdered and cut up or whatever you know Trump\nDoesn't do anything that ate the bad guy because he couldn't do that and if he does stuff and it's going to put a lot of people out of it they put ... I mean we've got ... dollar for the contracts with the Saudi\nRight and they were going to put sanctions on what I'm going to put a lot of our people out of work find it either way the way it comes to the bad guy on this and it just kind of bothered me I\nI I don't know if that ... what Oh thank rich thanks\nYeah I I obviously some bad actors over in the Saudi Government somewhere don't know who they were and that's the thing to punish the entire country and all people\nNot knowing you know where it came from I mean\nWe have murders in Chicago but but we didn't we never blamed borrow bronco Obama\nUm this was murdered and was that a counselor to it as like being ... you know it was ... I think that things happen with the ... the Hillary Clinton cause we didn't even blamed Hillary Clinton I mean I don't know who in Saudi in this but it it it's worthy of an investigation worthy of finding out\nUh but the question is do we punish the entire system\nFor whatever happened then and those are good questions ... ... yeah it\nPuts them hey man do corner at all I mean he's not that it's not a Democrat in the Democratic base for the Republican which way they got to have something to come back on um on\nPolitics plan to appreciate the call thanks I and a male I Know you've been following that one\nWell a little bit the only because it it's one of these no win situation I think the caller was right there is no win situation in in the best thing for us to do just\nOff and say hey you know\nOut what happened [noise] and I think there are well we're gonna they they sample bay over there they sent a a [noise] you know Trump's been over there and\n[noise] you know do we ... is our entire foreign policy completely changed over this one guy's murder that uh we don't really know where that would be a little ridiculous um\nLately changed over this one guy's murder that uh we don't really know what happened and that would be a little ridiculous um I think but uh there's what some people are calling for\nYet is it we cancelled contracts everything and these are the same people that said it's OK to open up relations with Cuba that Venezuela's wondering country and all these countries that have human rights issues horribly they want to do business with\nBut now Saudi Arabia who's been a a bad guy and a friend for years I mean they've been both but in Desert Storm we we have their bases there\nAnd they they were able to cooperate communicate with United States all along a arms deals or whatever that one of the few people in that region in the country that's powerful that we can count on\nAll again is that it was we we hadn't and\nMutual mutually beneficial a relation that I did one thing we are not any more any longer totally dependent on them as far as for oil anymore oh however you come to me it is we reached the point now where we're we're was far as oil is concerned we can't take care of ourselves\nAnd that's another another thing why we cut off the oil supply and cut off all our relations because of this journalist it we because we're already I guess many people have already come to conclusion they know exactly what happened [laughter] well we don't even need a trial that you know we we were fine we know exactly what half of course\nA which is there's a little ridiculous er\nI I ... the way Trump gets out of this I think he's doing exactly what he's doing yeah sit back and wait for now he he is he's investigating that we sent pump a all over he's not taking the issue is is it as as a non issue these ... as you but he's saying don't jump to ... don't jump to judgment\nRight right and that's a that's a smart thing to do and you don't you know if\nHe would've jumped to a conclusion and then be found out wrong and his critics would really\nNow they're having a ball as it is quite frankly they do they think that the they ... they think he's he's squirming actually he's not squirming new sitting there and saying let's wait to see what happens if we find out and then we'll make a decision\nHe's managing the situation and whatever he decides I'm kinda curious how he's going to handle it well but whatever it is I Know he wants to\nHow he's going to handle all depend on what they what what bump ailing and other investigators find out about this\nHe wants to do the best for our country exactly and that I hadn't really confidence I think so and that gives me comfort that he's not going to come to a rash decision or do something that's going to harm us right and uh and and just as the prince may be involved in that the prince hated him yeah\nAnd the prince you know and him were were enemies now did the French have it done I don't know who knows I don't know and I don't know how these people's that no we do know um are the chances are that he had a hand in it\nWell common sense would tell you he's in control and possibly he's got more than ... he's got a lot of control so yeah it it would make sense that that he might have something to do with it but it's not not a guarantee there may have been some people act on his behalf improperly to enough I don't\nThink it would have happened without Don Corleone aids approval\n[laughter] and I maybe ... maybe that happens here and that's that's and that's\nQuite possibly the situation and we don't know\nAnd maybe the prince finds the guy that did it without him there was a public execution and it's over\nYou know [laughter] the hairy you shouldn't have done that and uh and he\nTakes one for the team and knows yeah I I\nMean I watch a great curiosity yeah and a trust that enough enough people that do know the the playing field and know what's going on like Palmdale when Trump and and others and and Trump's been doing international business is alive\nHe's not a foreign to that somebody if I knew no no no ... you can work its way through it without question a a hundred of human yes I'm Still doing when they were still sponsor of the show are still talking to him and in fact I was in or you know why it was interesting\nRonnie calls me\nAnd I'm driving down thirty second street he says hey Russia just lets you know what I was over and Hyundai of Yuma\nAnd I and I drove by I I so I drove in a lot like it I catch it but he was pulling out the other side I was born in a but\nHe'd been listening commercials enough he was just curious to walk in there and a test drove that Santa Fe sport\nAnd he said if I were buying one right now for sure I'd buy it right now I Would um\nI don't think he's made up his mind on whether it needs another new vehicle right now and\nAnd it was just a scouting expedition which is fine but if you don't know if you want to be it or not take a test drive it's OK you're finding out if you like the brand you like the are the options you ask them questions\n[laughter] that's right anyway a friend of mine we're calling them at the marijuana\nThing was just over in California over the weekend and I'm going to make a correlation or he went into a I got him and his wife or they went in and Danny's and they had their kitten with them so when they serve them strength they drank had no lid\nI don't know that well you got to ask for that so you got to live and you know the straw thing it was telling me the first time we would have drawn public they put your name in a file and a warning the second time I think he said as a three hundred and fifty dollar fine if you get caught with a straw\nOr ... or whatever the heck it is the lid outlawed\nRight as California so we understand and he also says no matter where you went there were people smoke on weight all over the place you could smell yeah\nYou know and uh\nAnd you know I don't quite have that happening right now I mean they people drink and then they were walking around all over the place in public drunk I mean\nWell a lot of lot of places don't allow Ronnie and are those that do I think they're going to find it hurts business commerce and though it's it's gets kind of harm their communities but uh we just need to make sure we don't harm ours but it's all we can do\nIt in more ways than that I ... I think so yeah we make sure we do to have you you\nDon't watch a lot of TV we can but but I I'm just making a comment that it's you know once in a while it's it's a it's an accurate comment or a but you know about Roseanne Barr things had gone went on when yeah when I ... and they\nThey killed off by having a ... oh Dee yes\nOpium it was horrible what they did a family show is supposed to be a comedy I guess they were so mad at her they gave her opium either the not in real life this is the character there has been well they uh they debuted at ten ten million viewers\nDown to fifty five percent from when she was on the show of force on opening day so they may be in trouble there with ABC man and a lot of people tune in to see what we're going to happen and when the shows you like but I don't think that shows believe in good taste in people's mouth that they can't wait next week to see what happens\nYou know what what you know I that that show is doomed it from the start uh it'll be on for another month and that'll ABC you'll say well we we messed up here and that's where I Would put championship bowling back on or some of the theater\nThere at the same ones that got rid of a last man standing course because it was too conservative we think\nDon't they don't admitted they don't say that\nBut uh but apparently it's really doing well now that it's on a different network yeah um I don't but I guess after last man standing\nThey wanted to make sure the Roseanne can't go to another station because she did [laughter] how can you overcome that opium there yeah can't just go with another station the opium overdose\nWhat's it's like waiting ... killed off a colonel Blake oh yeah no way they could bring him back and it didn't necessarily so\nOn are not less um you know somebody's monitor shows with zombies or something if you know some go store yeah but yeah I'm\nA and she wasn't happy about is Roseanne Barr was no [noise] well not not only that they they did that which was a necessary but the whole opium connection and all that and then it that's not the type of show it was either know or in fact I think the producer came out regretted it\nWell it for a comedy show it surely wouldn't much the laughing so\nNaturally understand and you know and I see a little little excerpts from it little by little bits and him as like that so I focused awfully pretty ... or a little I saw was rather dark\nYeah it was dark it was dark [noise]\nMale I Want to talk about ah [noise] you know a a bride to be that was slammed\nBecause she held a party you know how new married couples sometimes we'll party bachelors or ... his bride um got herself famous on social media because she held little party and only like six or seven friends you know we'll party for that\nAnd they had a little bit of alcohol some gifts um\nAnd only like six or seven friends will party for that and they had a little bit of alcohol some gifts so peanuts they bought some napkins and cupcakes or watermelon all those kinds of things\nAnd they know that perfect because each one was in an itemized bill was expected to pay a portion of it or they don't know ...

I don't think you'd want him no\nNo because he's not going to follow along political winds and in in when someone and he's a Fox News contributor but when he when he's going to be on and talk about a a current subject I really watch and to me because I have no idea\nWhat he's going to say because\nHe's going to follow the law yeah and it's not going to be\nIt's not Republican or download that liberal Oregon's oh it's the law and that's why all about you know this is this guy went to Alan Dershowitz\nYeah ... which to become an appreciation for him he\nAh I always thought he was yeah a a liberal jackass but you know what the ... the more I listen to him the Bible you know he does he he said the law says hey well our we should do a in well you can do it right there's not there's not ...\nI'm a I'm going to disagree with you I think you're wrong he has a liberal jak but [laughter] but it does lay maybe you might be becoming a libertarian I don't know any more it's easy tremendously tremendously fair tremendous ...\nIt and I ... in that a change because I always thought the same thing that he was\nClinton or whatever and letting wanted we're going to find a legal way to support it but he hasn't been that way I Know not that he was supporting President Trump on some issues ... yeah and the liberals left him yeah well that's right like we don't care if it's legal we don't like him [laughter]\nAnd and that's been that's been the attitude of things recently yeah Howard is we all found out and\nAnd figured out unfortunately yeah it has been a\nThe the issue and

both both of you and you were the first year the big\nAnd it's kind of scary that was their strangers yeah and you're not really comfortable going to talk to them safe space that after the first person I just wanted to go talk to everyone else so\nThat we told you do when you're going to get you shut up and get them which is yeah I Know [laughter]\nThey kept going what does it mean to you though on it was well what did you learn from the exercise\nI learned how to start conversations instead of waiting for other people's people that come to me right um especially learning how to talk to the more adults\nNow are getting ready to over person but I caught you that's good yeah [laughter] I don't and yeah\nAnd just having more of a formal way of speaking to them and\nI'm getting them to talk and more of listening and talking yourself\nYou hit all the key things and I know a Eli we shouldn't and observe people for quite some time yeah and and\nAnd how much did you learn about people pie just observing that that it was nothing you would normally do\nNow 'cause like you look at a prison any like approached them how they're feeling and you gotta like match their attitude or else they kind of like yeah right overwhelmed or like under well\nAnd you were our last one you're just shy of St out of the group [laughter] you just are um but you really you really just seemed to adapt pretty quickly now and you seem to have continued that in the last few weeks relied on yourself doing it more outside\nThe yeah I actually introduce myself to John Curtis and I like it was very nervous but I\nTry to make me nervous [laughter] okay [laughter] and and you\nKnow what your uh what's your platform Eli\nMy platform is step towards hope and I really want to get more young adults involved and really for life so that's why introduce myself to John Kurdish that I could become a student ambassador for them\nAnd and he's very open about that chamber is really humming under his leadership and he's really looking for young people to get engaged I'm sure that wasn't a northwest for him\nNo he was very excited and he even invited me to talk at the kickoff tomorrow at from

but you were in and you're the actor but but that makes sense to me actually and I'll tell you why later I don't have time for the whole story but um it makes sense to me but you you want to be able to have that talent and skill\nWell I get really nervous before I go on stage and I just\nThere isn't it ... and then I go on stage and it's like gone like I tend to be someone else like I Would tend to not be me so I'm not nervous\nOkay that it works out that you're going to do a dramatic speak I well yeah and we already worked one day on that yeah and it was fun for me I've never done that before where I've taught anybody traumatic speaking and I had to go research really yeah you made me work [laughter] had to go research did it help you at all\nYeah 'cause it really helped me like

a side and so and then I've known open a lot of my friends who have been affected by their loved ones and stuff\nSo I just really want to make a difference in it and I have and then the spread of kindness goes along with it because if you're kind of one other than that would help someone that is troubling and then\nAlmost tied into that into a fully thing because it's like they're not even very much in\nThe news and very much visible on on those are the same time we got into bowling we'd go to our um your politicians going in each other's\nYeah it was almost the opposite of that type
