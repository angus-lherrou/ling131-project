talking about but the um [noise] reporter's got released it centers we're gonna we're gonna find out how fast it takes\nTo leak it here shortly are good because I don't I don't think it's I don't think it's hit any news yet is about what's in it here's what's happened here's what it says though there's there's nothing there I mean nothing that we don't already know nothing to change anything nothing to do a you know the shows anything that\nKevin I'm left something out or the you know there was a witness of surprise witness\nThat came forward so probably it's going to stay the same that Democrats all say say I you know I Can't vote for Kavanaugh\n'cause he's FBI conclusions don't fit my narrative [laughter] and they'll say though it's a it's a it's a bad report probably didn't invest get enough people that's already been suggested to take a phone call you're on the air\nHey Russia is trying out in the foothills take the morning Brian starts morning by a drawing a correlation between two things that I'm the first is is that a\nRepublican conservatives in favor of the wall you know are especially white conservative Republicans uh-huh are constantly called racist against a Mexicans because we want the wall right and that's just stupid because my feelings would be the same\nAll things being equal if Sweden was\nNext to us rather than Mexico has helped doesn't have anything to do with the nationality or racist stereotype\nI just I think you're correct that drop I think you're correct so why do they do it right exactly I mean I'm asking you what do you think uh [noise]\nPersonally I think it's the only ammunition they have to uh gain some uh attraction and putting their people in power\nThrough they've got no logical reason at all\nSo they re they go right to a personal attack and it's it's personally attacking somebody to call them a wife beat her a racist rapist doesn't matter as a personal attack so they personally attack\nBecause they've got no logic at all yeah\nAnd the correlation dryness I just heard that a a certain organizations are calling for Kavanaugh to uh uh his nomination to be stopped immediately because he obviously angry and biased towards\nDemocrats based upon his testimony or do matter\nAngry and biased against Democrats yang biased against the people lying about them and trying to sabotage is a nomination\nAnd and you and it's ... I think it's a fair correlation of reaching for straws and because they can't the argument that they have against Kavanaugh has has nothing no footing in in New bases they immediately jumped into a personal attack insane when he was angry\nAnd you can already see it in England and France where they're going after free speech right so we've got to I mean you got to take a hard line on this and more importantly we got to push back on it yeah I'm\nMore importantly the other day I actually sat in a room which were and I won't tell what Congress minute was but another congressman\nWas going through the whole thing started going after cabin on it and the other congressmen said all rumor is that you know you've had unlawful uh relations with your farm animals\nWas okay you go to what\nYou need shows because well should we have an investigation into that because that's ludicrous you can't even make that kind of an accusation and goes to prove that I'm wrong\nBecause that's where we're getting and if you if you're going to go down this road\nYou better be ready to play by the new rules because you're not going to be in charge all the time anyway it's very very interesting we should I'm going to have a couple of really good ah speakers I'm looking at a match slap and John gives you the obviously would like\nTo come on again in a couple of other people I'm sure ... we've got to get somebody on who can talk about this and the next\nCouple of days tell me not going to run okay see buddy appreciate George thanks no problem you guys I Want\nTo serve the by which I'm George brunt or Washington bureau chief a call and then out he's got to go running probably saw somebody wants to interview or talk to but I'm standing outside where the senators are are reading this report this morning\nAnd I am so I talk to them later in to get is a feeling on a confirmation and I want to talk about some of the things I read this morning on the process of that\nTo them later in to get is a feeling on a confirmation and they don't want to talk\nAbout some of the things I read this morning on the process of that and on and how that's how the senators is going\nYou know Mitch McConnell is working to get that done Saturday Saturday would is the day that they are working to get it done we'll see how that happens there's FBI report did include more judges are more judges the friend up Kevin ... who had already sent a letter\nYou know and that that uh you you know under I guess thread of you know having your charges against him if he was lying about it but he wasn't being interviewed by the by the FBI was ... apparently got on your personal hard times\nYou know rehab and stuff like that and he's got a recluse a but he's he a state of before he didn't see act in this manner as for describes and Ford says he was in the room and he says didn't happen\nAlso in ... they interviewed Deborah Deborah Ramirez\nAnother accuser\nBut right now the the fate now and I want to really ask George about this because I haven't heard a lot about Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nThe two Republicans that is still up in the air but there's not been there I haven't read anything about him I haven't read any comments or do they made whether they will or will not defend the FBI reports got mean anything to I don't know um they've been pretty quiet a Jeff Flake is also\nA questionable although he said he's going to vote as he just wanted to one you said that he's going to vote for Kevin on the one of the one week pause in order to appease just raptors but what Jeff\nIs is going to find out today or probably already knows you're not going to be something no matter what\nYou know maybe it'll be more and more voters maybe maybe that's a blessing maybe there's more voters would say well they did above and beyond on them and also some questions about Joe Manchin Democrat out of West Virginia\nBecause West Virginia one big for Trump\nAnd he's a Democrat running in West Virginia\nAnd it may it may ruined his Jimmy may hurt him and hurt his chances reelection vote against it sometimes votes come down to that list you know listening to your constituents sometimes it comes down to that and sometimes that's fair or so he's he's going to be looking\nA George distracts me says you've just grab by a staff member wonder if that means or throwing them out\nWe'll be

know they looked like dumb and dumber in my opinion you know they're they're just ... it's it's irritating I you know I I'm not surprised flake\nPointed out I'm not also um what about a defamation

this stuff from you defamation\nLaws any slander laws can Kevin lost to a committee rules guidelines broken a ... there there are these constitutional\nRules and laws and I think he needs to go after some of these Democrats on the committee I think he needs to go after sweat neck or whatever her name is\n... um I think Avon naughty um needs to be investigated I mean this um once\nYou're once you're a public figure like this um I ... I I think it's ... it's hard to prove any kind of\nWorking equal in my opinion Ross these were legal attacks on on this man I mean what the to him I mean it\nIt well the problem is going to get into his ... is is not slander so much as as a under oath\nWhereabouts sweating I mean you know what I mean by that ... you know what I\nCall the cops and handcuffed me because I remember hanging out by the punch bowl a lot when I was in college\nAnd a ... by and let me see I mean I Will\nMe see I ... I agree with you it salacious which he did he went from he was drugging ladies and getting them drunk for the guys that were gang raping I mean that was the initial story and then it goes down to well I'm not sure which ones I went to parties where there was rapes going on\nBut um I don't know if he was at all of them and also I saw was him stand about much more exactly right you're exactly right and you would think that that's land or if there is a case for that would definitely be\nA good place to start with but it's been my experience and I'm not a lawyer obviously but that's been my experience\nThat once you're a public figure because you know I had lies told about me on the front page paper you know during my\nSo I'm not a lawyer obviously but it's been my experience that once you're a public figure because you know I had lies told about me on the front page paper you know during my election quite regularly by prominent people that knew better than you the truth\nAnd she uh she just sworn statement though Ross right where she\nWell that's that's different than this lander because that's perjury at that point so that they have to\nGo to sort of that one was broken ... there was the was broken\nRight yeah if they knowingly and willfully and the and I guess the lawyer stuck struggle and tackle those things on what is and as soon\nAs you know shooting go after after should go after some of these people on the committee because I work on the show last part them though yeah\nThe way the way the way\nThat the the the phony Vietnam vet a you know a very limited our vets really really in my opinion offensive to them\nOr the red state Democrats yeah uh every single one of 'em and it's all campers that if they if they go against the is it dropped the main twenty\n[laughter] and so I mean are most of those are the Democrats the party the Democratic senators and red state\nIt's going to happen women are now starting to scream about though the glass ceiling not just going up but it is going down\nReally in it and it's too ...\nWell no right now if you you know if you're if if you're on the hill\nThe wives won't allow you to be with a\nUh I you know the old Billy Graham ah idea was never ever be alone with a woman that's not your wife yeah never have dinner on the other never meet or in a hotel room and uh never attended a party that has alcohol without your wife I'm with you\nThose are coming back you know goes\nDown came up with this whole thing for for Christian businessmen mhm uh my parents picked it up\nAnd was just lambasted for it and now all of a sudden people are standing around 'cause they're they're ... you know the idea you know now they're being breaking news nobody wants to be on your book step ever again\n[laughter] you know so is your background cleaning up the Supreme Court justice George\nYou know that a ... in this day and age I Can't possibly think so\n[laughter] as long as ... ... ah you know I Love women you know and uh\nYou know the thing is is that there's been a couple that didn't didn't like the fact that we broke up so so yeah after news have water them come up and say you know whatever and the um [laughter]\nYou mentioned the shows you mentioned the security and the security is more than normal the Capitol police is more visible than normal\n[noise] ah well first off anybody coming on into the Senate buildings in you're talking about a jerks than is we're all most of this is being done okay and uh\nOf the things is is that they have offices that are but for a while you had roving groups of protesters\nI'm going after people in the hallways senators and as they were going along and chanting it and then in going after the basically everybody believes that what happened with like the other day and the elevator because there was a camera there because they blocked down the war\nBecause of the fact that two people got that close without staffers or Capitol police stopping them yeah everybody thinks it was that a nobody believes that was actually true\nAnd the question that comes out is whether or not uh somebody and the Soros organization has money\nA golf course or you know in in a Blake's pocket or whether or not he's being black male that's the big question and a lot of people have\nSo have you ever written the property and\nYou've ever written the members only elevator in the Russell building\nI have with them for a reading the times when members aren't there but that wasn't the members only elevator was I thought it weird part because I thought they only know no reason for him there was no reason for him to be in that all day during the first place\nAnd I've got it on good authority\nFrom Neil Medicaid um and to other people that they locked down the full or half an hour before that happened\nNow you know and then that didn't make any sense at all\nSince you hang around the there are a lot and you were in those buildings or what have you ever seen a senator a constant like that where the Capitol police to step in immediately and and come down there you\nKnow um and you know and this is this is a funny story about this is a you know I'm On the John Carroll society\nAnd we did the red mask last Sunday\nThe front page of the Washington Post where are you there I Am when a attorney general sessions came walking up yes but it was\nReally weird because I was telling this story to everybody all day long this is a little Asian woman came up and she was wearing a shirt with the constitution on it\nAnd she looked up at me and she says this is the day the lord has may rejoice and be glad and I said well amen sister welcome to St Matthew using the red mask come on in and\nShe just then the attorney general came walking up now\nUh the attorney general and I are old friends\nThe Capitol Hill club so I looked at it goes George and I said this will be Mr attorney general it's been a long time and and\nJust in this gal means in takes a selfie with him and then kisses is rain and thank God that he is our attorney general really and it would all\nSince there were thirty cameras across the street it was caught by everybody\nAnd it ended up on the front page of the of the paper or the Washington Post or I guess you know the fish wrapped that it is a on Monday and I didn't find out about it so like noon because I got a ... you know we were in the Supreme Court that morning doing\nA motion to get new people in in a in the first oral argument by the way was about a\nDusty fraud it'd be you know for\nWarehouse case [laughter] ah yeah so\nBut I but when we walked out everybody was calling me saying hey you're on the front page of the pope's but the thing is that the first thing I said that this woman after the attorney general went in and do you get that close to somebody like that again somebody's going to tackle you and take you off the you know to\nCause there's that much you know there's that much nervousness out there there's that much security obviously\nWithout a doubt I mean you can't you can't believe and and not only that but there's it's scary because\nIt's not that far away from one school lease happen ... where a man and Jeff Jeff Flake in in a number of other congressmen and senators on that ball field had there not been to\nCapitol police there with side arm all of them would have been dead\nLet's you know let me let me get back to ... not just for a minute we'll go through on Saturday nights with Mitch McConnell's set up in these he's looking for I'm having a logo on Saturday you think it'll happen equipped to Democrats will come up with the way to start a little blocks\nThey can't they don't have the uh cloture votes already gone through\nOne of the deal will not vote but the culture or there's already been a an ounce I guess they voted the\nCloser that means that they can stall unless we let them stall\nBut here's here's the genius of the president United States who's been going against the FBI for\nWhat month now yeah basically saying there's a problem there and we need to really completely clean house over there ... and that you know they're not exactly where they should be all of a sudden you have Democrats who beg for an FBI\nInvestigation now saying that the FBI is biased and he'd be looked at and I'm going oh wait a go now you got ... exactly the other side\nAren't you on your side is whatever's Expedia or whether the FBI is biased or not yes\nYeah so what ... what basically this president by you know and and it still comes down to can you remember what happened at a high school party Thirty years ago\nBy you know and and it still comes down to can you remember what happened at a high school party Thirty years ago\nI wasn't very popular I don't

Ninety three to six in the Senate approved\nThe opioid legislation Ninety eight to one um this article says that\nThe Senate kind of like in a prevent defense if you will use a NFL terms they're just not allowing for anything that uh that the Democrats could use to to to clogged out clog up the process now we all know about filibuster filibuster is something that can\nI Do I'm bringing it to your show\nI certainly didn't know about that is amazing I Know there's a shortage of drivers right now my son's a drone or my son my brother or let me see\nYou ain't seen nothing yet they they don't have any nothing yet they don't have enough people to put in um I don't know I'm I'm looking at it because\nThey said on Fox News I look at it said that continue to search and big rig orders may be another signal of a booming US Economy as\nFreight market records is best quarter ourselves and history\nThat's you're right that's great news so you're not going to see it in the most of the media because what what\nOutlook stuff that nobody else does that's right I I that's why I get criticized the guy that\nThey got ... ... ...

I I ah I read a refreshing the page I thought something something happened to the computer and then I had to\nAh I read the article about the global bonds bonds ill just spiked a multi year highs and its feeling everyone's biggest fear about the markets that's that's the\nThat's the article from above the magazine or a A R from Business Insider I so I I I looked at it real quick and it's a you know it just it just rush through the world real quick I mean everything's instantaneous on then everybody's markets all connected everybody's in information is all connected so they ah\n\nAh so what ... talking about uh you know the ... absolutely growth in the industry the growth in in the trucking or because of the economy and everyone is up beat a that's what's causing the uh\nThe fed saying we're going to say we're going to throw some water on it we're going to we're going to put some interest rates on it it doesn't change anything the economy is still good or but it it may or may stop stop some of the explosive growth which which causes fear for\nThe economist they don't want to they want to grow more control so they control and\nYou know I've been um [noise] I have not attended a\nCity hall meeting you know city council meetings haven't been involved in that into things for quite some time and I'm I'm gonna start doing more than I Know I've been ... messaging back order some people to do it at that point out the fact that I Do not show up and I haven't shown up\nAnd uh my intention is to get more engages I open up a business again and get more engaged in the\nUm [noise] the chamber of commerce and things like that but then I read this article about what happened and just in Gary Indiana at a city council meeting\nSomebody came in and sat down to the city council meeting that was crawling with big\nBed bugs and then and that's enough to to ... for the ...\nA city council meeting that was crawling with big bid bugs\nThat and that's enough to to do for the new factor ... books I mean it's it's an epidemic in some places are and has been I don't know if it is still currently like New York city and some of the hotels and and places but it's a big fear because they're hard to get rid of apparently I've never had the big bugs in the house but they're nasty\nI mean they they you can't get rid of the day all around the jumping the ... the the jump out you know there are just a war of them\nWas guy coming quote with the bugs and and caused and cause disruption a disruption to the point where the firefighters are called in\nOr maybe I could sort of the opposite of that state reach says and he says when you put it into perspective that less than one percent of our budget is going to defend our people our values in our resources I think most people would say don't stop and I and I agree with that it is the value of\nThe um of a lot of those in California to be anti Trump and that's what this is all that it's all about politics in a means just being fought so many ridiculous levels are the politics of things\nHe said anyone that you know these these dogs\nThe means just being fought so we did give us levels are the politics of things\nHe said anyone that you know he's he's talking about the items on the ...

beauty pageant it's a scholarship deal right about growth cracked and community engagement community involvement\nAnd platforms I mean girl eats girl individually has their own platform is something that the\nWhich is ... which is to show community sporting or crashes ... support for an issue will cause the community there are sometimes all combined right and they all have that as part of it and

opened up and now they want to go talk to people\nIt's good yes and that's and that's what I always think people have been so stuck in the past where you know well we just need a drill in with questions and you know\nAnd and then yeah and that does Mr clauses noise I mean there are good a good experience and it was about practice but it's not about instruction\nRight well and it's it's there's so much more to being able to answer than just answering a question for you know and I think but that's where it's always been says stock\nIs like well let's have mosques with mocks marks mocks experience of having a panel of judges asked that question questions that goes with that I haven't even started with any of them know care about them now and they're they're so confused

just got to crank basically with\nUh some triangle things looking on that just runs around in a circle and the and the combustion just keeps pushing in that direction okay it's not really a piston going up and down and just really smooth circle thanks very smooth engine because there's not there's not there's there's no point in going going [laughter] to\nA very smooth engine and it was only in the ... has had him for years and they don't have any more they start making because hard to make them more fuel efficient fuel efficiencies\nReally key oh yeah nowadays and it was hard for a a you know pollution aspect of it and all that that was just harder to control or they didn't find ways to do it so they just continue to bringing them back and then we'll tell you why they're bringing it back because the um\nThere ... there is no vibrations very little there's no the vibrations limits on the road there are smaller and come back like when you have to do the pistons they become larger heavier larger bigger they want the lighter smaller compact engines\nAs a generator for a plug in hybrids\nSo they're bringing back the rotary engine and so it's smaller lighter\nAnd and they've been working on the fuel efficiency and working on everything else so monsters looking and putting them in ... plug in hybrids was I Can't things in the use of yeah or the technology they worked on me I'm
