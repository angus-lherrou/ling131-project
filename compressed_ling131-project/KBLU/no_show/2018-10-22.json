they've got some deals going on over there but for the two thousand eight teams I Know it was a lot of rebates available I've heard three and four thousand dollars going to go by and she would special is right now and talk to them because the the dealer will tell you exactly what they are but some of the Santa Fe sports Saddam as\nI Know it was wonderful cars but they go for warranties brand new cars there's no difference brand new five years sixty thousand miles ten years a hundred thousand on the drive train and go look at the new Santa Fe sport also it's longer it's bigger than they made more storage room in the back it's becoming a larger SUV\nOr for the two thousand nine teams like the two thousand I deemed a new Kona which is kind of knew this year came out earlier in the year uh but that's a smaller SUV\nBut they keep adding to them and and there's reason to keep winning the war it's for safety winning awards or just for the best cars in class including the genesis\nWhich I still never driven money to get out there they've offered it to me I just haven't driven it\nBecause I like it I Do but genesis electric model beat out the Mercedes and BMWs\nOutright so go by and

state of Arizona we started elected you know we started deal you know the male the male ends and then a lot of people already called me and just asked me if you questions or to clarify a few things and sometimes it causes me to go do more research that's fine\nSomething else that's a that goes on to win election time you know the parties get involved they tried to promote and in you know their candidates platforms and stuff and I got a copy someone sent me a promotion\nFrom a Democrats or they they they go hang on doors you know hang on doors tell people how to vote which is fair legal thought style of surprises Arizona Supreme Court no the Arizona Supreme Court\n... none of them they they still go on the ballot just to save for retention you want to ... you know keep them which I've never heard of them I've never heard of an issue with anybody on the Supreme Court you know bad\nBehavior or anything that would say you're not a good jurists or anything like\nThat\nThe Democrats are suggesting just vote no on retention then I'm assuming that means all retention 'cause they didn't specify over to just get rid of everybody but they're not politicians are jurors\nUm I don't know what it what that is other than they'd all like this to the ruins of the court they think they want to change the courts by putting one activist judges in or something\nUm\nI don't I don't know if that happens often I don't know how long how often a jurors will\nBe a get the no vote\nAs a majority I have no idea I've never I've never paid that much attention to it but apparently the Democrats are they're just saying vote no\nWhich is a little surprising to me I don't know the reasoning behind a no one one twenty five which doesn't surprise me that proposition one twenty five\nProposition one twenty five has to do I hope I get this right I get a mixed up sometimes but retirement funding for the state of Arizona which we know\nIs costing the state huge money when I say costing the state that means cost and the tax payers there's nothing Costa ... states states only got our money that's what they've done is our money so any time they spend it it's our money in and um\n[noise] our retirement program needs to be revisited because it's richer than any of the taxpayers can afford I I mean for themselves people at the end of the taxes\nGenerally don't have a retirement plan program anywhere near as rich as the state's program or a lot of the\nUh retirees and in the state because\nYou know it's defined benefits and who would they get a percentage of pay the rest of their lives which is the deal and I think one twenty five is is a\nOne that\nLooks at the increases of that every year year after year it gets looked at it increased and and from what I understand one twenty five will stop the increase for being so rich\nRight now it's around four percent it would take the maximum the two percent which is more in line with reality but uh they say no they want to have more\nWhich is more in line with reality\nBut they say no they want to have more money paid to the uh retirees\nAnd um and I don't know that that surprises me it's just it's just disappointing because of the people to pay that or or all of a sudden it's just it's richer than anything else out there I mean it's a it's a good deal if you can get it\nBut I'm at what cost and I know in some places where they hire a fireman\nThe or pay for the retirement will be more than the salary\nBecause we are behind because it was bad investments because they got to pay for the current as well as planned for the person's retirement it's going to retire and you know put it into the fund so ... it's been a system that's been upside down and crazy for a long time and they're trying to fix it and it's got to go through referendum or propositions\nThey put the\nYes on one twenty seven which I find real disappointing because that's the solar power and I know the Democrats consider themselves greener party\nThey want a yes to everything green but this is this is\nCrazy what one twenty seven days and and it's not a suggestion of what's going to happen we know what's gonna happen at one twenty seven one twenty seven will mandate I I think it's upwards of fifty percent solar something's not just solar but renewable not not counting nuclear renewable\nBy the Arizona Army National guard here by the Arizona broadcasters association of distraction\n[noise]\n\n... what do you just starting on Monday to talk about some of the propositions\nDemocrat flyer that went out with recommendations\nAnd of course they were yeah someone twenty seven which would increase your abs bill like crazy we don't know how much you had because some of the stuff we have to do to make it happen and what we've done which would be mostly renewable resource you know power\nInfrastructure doesn't exist because a lot of it as a man and then into storage capacity admitted than just in in California is already in the throes of it and there's like three times the national average on rates we want to be three times or the national average on rage thanks so\nI'm typically technology has even been invented ... ... you're on the air\nMarty Russia okay the morning oh gee\nDo things you're talking about ... yes propositions all the proposition\n... any government body or someone represented governing body devote Seventy one page is that I Would call that a book or the encyclopedias\nTo proposition one twenty seven it's you just got to vote no on it right\nWhich I knew one guy ... many too\nAre going to read that oh nobody\nExactly 'cause I didn't read it you know so my point is\nDon't know and all that crap messing with Arizona's got Patricia its workforce for over a hundred years language you Frederick picked up at the not broken\nWell there are some things are broken or could be repaired but uh\nYeah but but not not in a midterm election that can have a referendum boat or something like that you know I Know that can do it another way to get people a couple of years I think about ...\n... ... ... no problem they they have referendum dog thing it's not it's not obey the law is just that it's just jump or you look at it now come back on the ballot couple of years later and they're not doing that this time there's something wrong it's thanks here in my opinion\nOkay okay now you're talking about the silicon and silver pouch yes I don't yeah All right well here's a question I asked a lot to do an apple product\n... not being oh they're broken branch did em question you know that don't ya [laughter] yeah do I do OK okay here's the liberal Web traffic respond it's called the green match\nSemi colon UK\nOr whatever that outreach to has far

California ... are they open that cemetery up so that people could see how many\nOf these poor folks they guy and across and they usually die either a desert or trying to put across the all American but uh I'm In it and then they mark the graves with a brick\nA marker a brick what a break about nine by three or something like that that's what they marked at greater ... acres of them over there and if they kept out of the public do I take a picture that ought to be posted right at the border\nAnd well big screen TV though that these people no one's going to face going to be if they don't make it\nIt's little known appreciate the call things that I um I\nI've looked at the dust on the border the entire border was upwards of five hundred a year which doesn't get publicized and that's the entire border and I think\nNow the last last records I have is in the mid century hundreds\nFor the whole border so about one a day for the whole border so unfortunate and it's usually dehydration whatever around the desert ... you're on the air\nFor us was done to morning John yeah [noise] I heard you talking about a caravan yes back you know five or six\nWith human patriots were released a video and those six there when they broke San Luis\nWall at once and the night January right that made national news that was on O'Reilly right and uh got a lot of trouble so I remember that\n[laughter] I used to use the man's role do you stay in trouble\nBut ah but I don't remember that video and no one believed that 'cause I was in the hospital but that was in May of uh oh six right and uh when I got sick and every released that showed it to the doctors beforehand and the laptop is who is on the news tonight and I remember\nIt lit up so much a because that wasn't supposed to be released while you're supposed to have that either but we release that video\nAnd uh it was an insane what that video showed plus all the problems up on the reservation at county uh fourteen and three quarters fourteen and a half that whole area there weren't\n[noise] cop cars get smashed off the levee a helicopter chases people aiming guns that border patrol agents oh yeah and it's just not realize how bad it was that made\nNational news and it was amazing how the Bush administration did it you know I read it a dancer out all that\nBut we're we're Fifteen Years later and we're not any better right now in fact right now we're we're hitting reading crisis mode right\nNow they have thought that if you saw that video the other night where they were just dropping over at Seventeen foot wall\nYup so when he's thirty foot you don't drop off for thirty\nWell the thing about it is the wall is a good deterrent because you can see what comes across yeah you have a physical barrier especially in urban areas you know you don't you know all\nThese people are trying to hide anymore to see the Seventeen works when they were trying to hide they're not trying to hide anymore because the laws they know the laws are in place that it doesn't matter you don't have to hide you just go to surrender they treat you they feed you they take care of you and then they turn ... loose and\nThen you should send you back and they don't do they don't do not know that we've been preaching this years ago and it's just that now it's just more critical and\nIt'll which it's getting crazy 'cause now we're being invaded this this whole Caribbean right now ten thousand people too they say he's an invasion it's not anything and I\nThought they got through the federal rallies and I don't know how they get through the federal rallies don't they have done\nAnd over and help people I don't know they're not going to shut it just it's insane and this one on back in ... five ...\nI Wonder how we Broderick radios to national attention and we're all doing the ticks and racist but everything else but the game playing now it's our heart back\nIt's changed now it's changed because laws have changed its it's become more more ah a easy more easy for them to just turn themselves in and say turn me loose and and they get turn losing never show up again they don't ... I mean there is no barrier into we fix the laws and then put the ... the same time\nThey both backed up until that I'm just telling you it's nothing you know seen this before I dig out the video see what I did with it\nIt's a different it's a different it's a different game now because no one's hiding when they rushed years ago was rushed to get through the board Joe so they didn't get caught they don't they want to give anyone\nRan right into the public housing which ...\nBut not but everything's different now they don't care they want to get caught that there's an understanding and education and somebody's paying for this John somebody's paying for this caravan somebody's paying\nA church Georgia's doing it\nYeah and it's an invasion of country now it's not it's not refugees it's an invasion called what it is and uh and we need to fix our cell resell them it's are\nA good job we've got to get rid of this uh thing about uh\nYou think just sell resell them it's are doing a good job we've got to get rid of this uh thing about uh uh\nIf you're thinking you're going to be attacked in your own country\nI Know I'm Sorry but we can't fix political problems in every country\nAnd there's there's not a country in the world that you don't have an opportunity to be attacked like if you leave them if you lived in Chicago you're going to get attacked\nIt's going to have it over the edge of the political refugees I mean the same thing\nBut hey it's history repeating itself is nothing new today that we didn't have before and uh it's just different day I'm going to different problem\nAppreciate the call but hey we got rid of the amnesty get rid of all this stuff and the people back and they would stop afterwards\nOh gosh yes once they realize you can't appears\nBorder they don't tell them well right now politically the Democrats have made it a you know inviting you know eight years of Obama is inviting and and they were afraid of Trump at first then they realized Trump can affect the laws and they're coming in droves\nEl uh [noise] I think Congress hopefully the Republicans keep control them get a\nIt sounds surreal I didn't I didn't know they were digging it let alone they're ready for this this new um underground travel with a hundred and thirty miles an hour which is if that comes through that would be wonderful I mean I don't know if you've written subways and other places but\nA hundred and thirty mile an hour wouldn't work in New York because\nEverything's built Paul you know you've got a million people in that little ... little area and by the time you get up to a hundred ... you'd have to stop before you got to a hundred and thirty you because they don't go that far and we go a few blocks and stop ... stop but in the air in areas like Los Angeles where the spread out and you want to go from one city to the next hundred and thirty might make sense\nFor long distance is not for not for like New York city subways there you don't want to go that fast [laughter] you wouldn't have time to speed up and slow down before the next up just wouldn't work but uh\nThis uh underground and Ilan Musk has in mind that I don't know I'm curious to see to see where it goes [noise] employees in execs and that would that look before I mentioned this when we have a a problem in the country of a more\nJobs available than we have people and I know you want to relay that back to the\nThe caravan comments well good luck to people and we need them will know skilled skilled labor the people coming in this caravan or not\nYou know the average aren't going to they're not going to have the education the high school to ... degrees even in in the education to be of any value for the jobs that are open but there's a lot of technical jobs or jobs cross country they're just having a hard time finding people for\nWell at the same time we have more employees in in executives are failing drug tests\nAnd it's not just marijuana and I know the marijuana things become legal for medicinal purposes and in many states in for recreational and the few\nAnd and granted that has walked out a lot of people from federal jobs locked out a lot of people when you get a medicinal marijuana gardening and you're not going to be working at a at a federal jobs\nBut now there's many jobs in New York City take sixty days to fill\nAnd we're talking registered nurses bartenders delivery drivers program managers\nAnd and\nProfessional professional websites are finding sixty days to fill jobs and all that so it's not like there's there's more employees looking for jobs and there are jobs\nAnd a lot of it has to do with the number of workers that are getting tested\nAnd they've had a hundred and fifty percent increase from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen of methamphetamine positivity rates for workers hundred fifty percent on methamphetamines so the drug problem\nIs locking people out of jobs because it's going to disqualify you is uh getting alarming national unemployment stands at a forty nine year low three point seven percent and the number of openings exceeding job seekers is nine or two thousand and that's just\nThat's just New York\nOr no that's nationwide Labor Department said the job openings in August topped record seven million nationwide with a number of openings exceeding job seekers by nine hundred and two thousand it's nationwide\nSo\nA lot of jobs available in the country for again trained experienced a lot at some of the technical some of it not so much bartender stuff like that\nFraternities and openings all over the place so I mean even if you talk to local local businesses\nA job avail mean jobs getting trained people and stuff I'm offering the right the right incentives to get people like work environment is necessary because uh uh people with a lot of skills have their pick of where they're going to go in some places depending on the skill level\nSo it's it's not going to get any easier either and do the caravan that's coming from the south is not going to fill those jobs you can't ... the the skill level isn't there\nUm we're talking about people that would have time to just to integrate to learn to integrate did and it's overwhelming the amount of coming in\nBut uh it's just something to\nSomething the country's going to have to handle figured all well but we need to stop it I mean we need to we need to have immigration is fine but it needs to be programmed in these be applied for it needs to be be done reasonably so it doesn't it doesn't affect negatively\nUm you know our country our cities or towns that get inundated overwhelmed with uh people that can't they can't function\nStick a phone call you're on the air\nYou're darn right when it comes to people wanting to go out and work there are a lot of jobs around town and small businesses large businesses never help wanted signs all over and I even heard that from a friend up in a minute photo area but nobody\nNobody wants to work well I don't really know money I'm not\nSaying nobody but I'm saying the majority and it's not like it was before ... and you can speak to any business plan or in the town and they'll probably tell you about the same thing and I've seen it with a even adult\nCome in and work your way our ... I only work three hour for the last two weeks in training I Can't do this I'm too stressed out\nOh there was a big change the hunting and then there's then there's\nThis strange corners and then their parents have there they don't want to want their kids they even go out and find any kind of a job\nThere are some I I Know well I Know a few and it's on iPhones meant\nWell they got a ... well maybe somebody needs a little bit more a\nKick in the butt [laughter] learn some things you know\nAnd you know this this caravan this you know what are we putting up with what the heck is going on you know\nRomney it's an invasion and I think the Democrats are overplay their hand\nUm I think this is all orchestrated to hurt the ... the Republicans during this election I agree and I mean I tell you I think it's it's gonna backfire on the Democrats 'cause it it's orchestrated invasion it's an invasion for political reasons it's an invasion 'cause our laws are wrong it's an invasion because\nThere's too many people welcoming somebody is you know these these uh sanctuary cities we don't take that whole ten thousand go drop in in in Los Angeles or or San Francisco\nYou know something I saw last night on the news that uh the majority of the people want to see a Democrat controlled Congress\n[noise] it's a small small majority in and let me tell you I don't trust the polls completely be you know after the election but if you start if you start taking a poll when you and you go to a major metropolitan areas to do that poll\nGuess what it's going to be heavier Democrat\nOr it is because because that's the coastline and that's where the people that are doing the polls live\nSo I I don't know that they're calling the whole rural areas\nAnd then they tried to elections you know how they are and I told you about that one that hit me that I Know something off\nI'm looking at a low maturity level\nYou have with you know this thing or what is this a\nPeople dabbling in paganism put curses on a cabin on that's\nAnnette oh witchcraft yeah I mean ... what the heck is going on here you know what do we live in it\n[laughter] well putting putting luggage and stuff\nThat's just a small fringe minority that's just sort of insignificant one of the\nPeople that I'm not a lot but there are people that jump on that you know and uh I don't know I just don't know what the heck is going on here\nYeah this this caravan thing is bad news and I know how to be stopped somehow\nWe'll see how we handle his but\nPeople dorm in our borders and you know jumping fences and everything else and coming over here\nYeah well they're going to hell there's a feeling out there of a process\nWho go through but you know when you're being that many people coming up this way that\nCan that's scary but again in ... she had to call man yeah daycare yeah he's just presidents got to be him you know careful with the insensitivity but I think people are fed up with this invasion grab\nThat you know when an unruly invasion will decide how many people come to America from Guatemala from Honduras you can't tell us how many people come to America will decide for you and we're going to invade or don't you do about it because you're laws are stupid\nThat's what's going on right now and we need to fix something on our end single phone call you're on the air morning the morning [noise]\nI I I I don't know what will you get up there I think that the Democrats are orchestrating this invasion uh I don't think it's a shared by any political party I just think it's wrong and I think if we want to do something about it I think uh I\nDon't know what we can do to get our energy to come back to work maybe will entice them with that extra bonus or whatever but I think they should pass some sort of an emergency a bill that saves you know what we put a freeze on all\nYou would get every Republican to vote yes for you go ahead and try to find a Democrat to vote yes and that's the problem right\nNow you you know that's the problem the problem is with people like you and our president I think this is the Democrat people that are trying to do this\nCrap will then stand on me wrong wrong wrong get okay\n\nPaying five sixty gave you record back with you but not really 'cause it's eight o'clock I gotta I gotta leave I got a\n... hour news [noise] and then these go to

Will be the first to confess that my ability to create an escape plan that will ensure that future success of their children's\nLegacy or their legacy to rip do their children is wholly inadequate in fact I'll add that uh I don't think there's an estate planner out there that has this skill or ability\nThe future success of their children in in essence their legacy depends on something that goes so much deeper than my ability to plan for\nMetro PCS is now metro by the mobile\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data a month long all under the mobile network check out the new metro

last segment talking about leaving the legacy in teaching your children to work and are having your children be your legacy but\nSo many young families miss out on that opportunity to come in and talk about an estate plan because they feel like they don't have an estate they don't have acquired wealth that they need to think about leaks\nIn ... about leaving their children at this point they're still working from day to day in and make sure that kid gets out the door to school on time\nCody you recently had your state plan done yeah and uh you fit into this demographic that I'm Talking to you right now young families that may not think they've got a lot to plan for but what was your experience\n... you know it really put in perspective on who your family is and where are they they live and yes you may be close to somebody but it doesn't really do any good if they're eight hours away\nOkay or or even more than that so I mean you you really have to put your mind around who plays a role and and what role you want them to play so it was a good exercise for me just to um\nIdentify what family I Want involved in the plan and which ones I don't oh good you know\nYeah and and and sitting down and really contemplating that is one thing but then doing it in the context where you can actually put a plan in place so you can have that a sense of\nSecurity that okay if something happened the person that I Want to be making decisions is not only going to be the person that selected but as the person that's available to actually do it\nExactly and I I think your point um a lot of people that they do come in that are younger and looking for plans they aren't really looking for the is the part of the things that they're looking more for hey I travel a lot and I want to make sure my family's protective ... or hey I'm In law enforcement and and that's a a extra you know\nThat's that's a potentially hazardous job\nSo I Want to risk out there they got very much basing them on a day to day so to me it's like\nThey're they're taking care of the health side of things they're not really thinking about planning but really you are planning by default you're you're doing that legacy plant right\nAnd so my encouragement for all those young families out there is to think about that takes them time to reflect on it and you may\nRun up against some hard questions that you don't know how to answer and that's where I come in or other professionals come in my job is to help you think through\nThese scenarios that either you're going to run into a dead end on your own or you maybe you didn't actually think of the the real issues that do come up and I can help present those issues to you and help you understand how to\nPut a plan in place that will resolve them or at least make sure your children are taking care of and you are taking care of him cases that crises\nWell because of your your um direction you know you did help me think about things differently I don't even think you know about this John Button because of a you know what we do and and how you've you've taught us\nUm my successor trusts the I I picked a family member that may not necessarily be you know my first and brother in line because he lives in Hawaii\nI picked a cousin that is in Arizona okay somebody that actually can get you within a matter of a matter of hours not days yeah yeah that's the thing I didn't really think about prior to talking to you about this process naturally go with your brother that's the next one in line right doesn't do any good when he's in order to hold another time zone\nAnd and legally that's ... that's who the hospital would have to go with what exactly so ... and let's go back to another experience that I had um this weekend so I\nDid a couple of things as we can one was we we did the seminars we did a seminar the foothills library and uh that was a great turnout\nOne of the things that we really preach at the seminar is that the number one obstacle for getting the stapling in places procrastination that you think you have more time that uh you'd think that you'll you'll get around to it and then it doesn't happen\nAnd so um we we really focus on that and at the end of the seminar we had a lot of people lining up and setting up appointments and and asking questions and that was good but one person in\nGood questions he was clear that he had an estate that needed some organization and um some direction for where he wanted the assets distributed\nAnd so he he stayed there 'til last and was the final person asking questions and so I just went down to sat next to him and I says well when when do I expect to see you in the office and he said well you know and I don't I'm not in the Senate appointment right now because I've got to get everything in order and\nSometimes you just can't get the message across my what the message that I Want to get across to everybody that's listening is\nThat's not your job to get everything in order it it's a professional job is think about it this way if your car is acting up funny especially you know with today's mechanics you got the computer is running the car\nDon't wait till you figure out what's going on with the car to take it into the mechanic to get it fixed that's the mechanics job he's there to diagnose it he can do it so quickly in so much more efficiently than you can\nAnd and that is in the state planners job is to go in and to help you understand what it is to be organized what specifically you need to be looking for so you're not wasting your time you're not lost out there and there's this endless um\nCycle of just going around and around trying to figure out what it is that you need to get an order\nWhen when we've talked to people we give them a very specific list this is what you'd do until the next appointment and and it's very achievable is going to take you\nWe can estimated the amount of time that it's going to take and you check these boxes on the list and when you get that done you'll have accomplished that next stage is ... I'm a stay plans take two appointments some take multiple appointments to come in\nUm will will close to the front and will tell you how much is going to cost you don't have to worry about spending money every time you come in and every time you have a question for us but we will tell you this is what it's going to take to get the estate plan done and uh the procrastination needs to just be built away with just\nCome in will help you get organized so\nThat was the one thing that did this week and the other thing\nWas I was out there working in the yard and uh\nI was pulling up some old wire now I've only lived in this house for six months so [laughter] how old can the wire be but I have a lot of landscape lighting put in and I've learned a lot by working on my house and and put it in the wire\nAnd so last week I told about the story high blew out all of those you know intercom devices that I that was well over five oh yeah [laughter] ... so I had these echo dots and I and I installed them in in the walls of of all\nMy killed children's bedroom so they could be used as an intercom and I and I put a twelve all the\nPower over ethernet injector on there and burn them all up at the same time well I ordered the new parts I got the the new wiring done\nAnd I and I got that fixed now I'm I'm replacing some worry that are put in for the landscaping because I put in it was it was to 'em then of wires Eighteen gauge wire were really I needed like ten gauge where cars landscape lighting goes over\nA direct current it's not alternating current so it doesn't go as far as in ... D windows out if the longer the distance it is\nAnyway so what I'm getting too is\nSome people including my wife might think well gosh it's so frustrating to be pulling up that why are they just put down\nAnd uh I really I'm now to the point where I don't get as frustrated when I'm redoing the job because I have learned so much along the process of putting that stuff in that now as my neighbors are doing it or other people are doing it\nI feel excited to go out there and help them and in part on on the skills that I've developed in the wisdom that I've learned in doing that and I look out at that level\nFaction but not near as much as the the wisdom that I learned in in how to put it down and then the actual getting out there and physically digging in the dirt and land some wire down and um and that was doing this I was thinking about some of the people that have helped me\nOver the course of years in in in building my house in a reflected specifically in this group of of young individuals that I was a young man's president in my last war that I was in I moved since then\nAnd as a young is president I'm In charge of all the activities for him in twelve to Eighteen years old activities like um service projects for charities and camping trips and uh fundraisers do to help us going this camping trips\nAnd and I thought financial and I'll find a way in the pay back was to help others yeah all the ever asked and to this day even the ... county thing is in honor of William ... Bush the third and have this I'm helping them with communications and I've never turned down an opportunity to do something like that\nAnd and that's a wonderful thing and that's something that I I just know from knowing you you get a great sense of satisfaction surveys and and\nThat the people that are participate in ... county I Know several of the um participants have years passed and the winters have years passed this is a fantastic opportunity to really develop\nTruly is yeah so this this gets it continues on given this exactly what I'm Talking about this is true legacy\nLeaving a trust fund is something that I can help you do and I can help you put together but the true legacy starts will be for that and that starts with the young parents that are out there that feel like they don't have time to come in and and and get a little bit organized and reflect on what they can do to really truly leave a legacy\nSo this um a couple of these young men that are helping me on the house\nUm it's it's really satisfying because as the project started to get a little more skilled for example we we got all of the breed cleaned out and now I'm as to the point where we're we're wiring the\nUm lights on the house both ... for the back yard and and just porch lights and so I'm going through and I'm teaching them how to why are these lights in on the outside of my house and\nTeaching them to do it takes a lot longer than me doing it myself\nBut boy having the satisfaction of sitting on the porch afterwards are stepping back on the back yard as we light up the house and and seen their face that they've accomplished something you know they know and they've got the skill now that they can take on and as as you know\nThey're raising their own family they can start doing these little projects and it's going to continue on giving\nAnd that really helped me feel good and that is the type a legacy that I think so many more people can can leave that were just so focused on getting the job done and moving on that we lose out on those opportunities to build the character\nAnd the real skills that are going to continue on giving there is a a sane and want to bring up some words of wisdom that were found on a wall in an orphanage in Calcutta, India and it says or what you spent years building someone could destroy overnight\nBuild anyway the good you do today people often forget tomorrow do good anyway give the world the\nBest you have and it may never be enough give the world the best you have any way this is often attributed to mother Teresa would we don't know who ... those are words and and\nThe ... what would it comes down to is sometimes we feel like if\nIf our name isn't pegged to a fund that continues giving than we're forgotten right\nBut really put our time and effort into something that is going to invest in a life in a community and that will continue on giving\nAnd really the ultimate accounting is with ourselves how are we going to fill an end with God right how are we going to fill with the time that we spend is limited amount of time that we have here on earth\nAnd what is going to help us sleep good at night\nAnd it's not having a bank account\nThat has you know so many zero's I'm behind well somebody's ear was my make house calls zero\nZero in the wrong way on that [laughter] but McCollum of [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nSo many dollars in the bank account um I've achieve some level of success in my life and I've gone to some real hard times times where I really didn't know where my next meal was coming from\nAnd I'll tell you I'm no happier now then during the day that I didn't know where the next meal is coming from 'cause those days where that I didn't know that I was serving I was working hard and I was developing skills and uh\nThat that's where the real truth satisfaction comes from and so for you\nWork and your tail off to provide for your family don't forget the lessons that will continue to give for them and make them work\nDon't give them the easy way out because by doing so you are depriving them of the opportunity to learn and develop those skills and their own and and to leave your own true legacy right\nAnd so you know that that's something that I wanted to put out there um what kinda plans can we do for young families what type of things I'm can they expect\nWell I'm not going to do the same type of\nComprehensive trust for you we're we're putting all of your assets into a living trust right now that I Would for somebody that's retired and uh they they've got a very\nUm clear picture as to what assets they have and what they're going to end up with I'm going to do something that's much more fluid and so we're going to talk about that when we come back we're coming up on a break and talk about what I call an unfunded trust or\nA comprehensive will package and so we'll we'll talk about that when we come back to says five sixty am cable you\nHave a
