talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I'm shuttles them subsequently become an atheist agnostic and not so I don't know what to say that you really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's the space I live in I live in a space during the week so it kinda bleeds throughout the Arab afraid\nAnd your shirt off when you said that job you know people come out of church and they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up\nYou know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly even wage of ... when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about Passover\nOr a sense of ... first born Egyptians or the great flood\nOr Saddam ... more of their own ... innocent children killed there so I mean\nYeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the ... to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so you know\nEverybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise] would you pay the money put your season sex you put your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith in having the perfect body or or that they that they're going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's

I don't get there very often but one of these days ...\nI'm not I'm not helping at all or even yeah we're neighbors okay\nWell the caller brought up something about that it up a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure let's go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected they asked now that's\nWhat it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections and I got to\nHeart but yes he did say that it's about ... sugar in my brain\nI bought that perfect set of encyclopedias channel that guy from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and like I didn't I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a\nFirst heart the first introductory heart and it was dedicated to clean it looked at that and Ronald Reagan\nWow ... ... you're going to if you haven't stand is he would probably intrigued by it but then it explains at this with a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica\nAnd they created the alphabet\nYou said they chose what to put it at length in that heart and then the index the other selections at their discretion and so when you look at Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica\nIt has just a few little paragraphs and it it costs to them that took off they gear or someone who might have live during\nA certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the ... or more information and then if you turn to Islam it is like page after page after page into regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting it's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing this\nAnd it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and I kinda feel like like they're not really good and like\nNot even [laughter] you don't do drugs ... years due to reduce the idea\nThat they mean like the as you said I I Know they're still printing the must still be printing Avery means nothing done completely the hall and you\nDon't see the last year the second Alaskans low credit to buy it gave them Hungary oh where's that at home and saw that in fact started looking up things and I thought who just why did she didn't make it this way and so yeah you can find out I mean if you could do home or on\nI ... I'm breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night\nOr I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to see if I Do it'll be in the first tower tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again and Thanksgiving ... may have to wait a while but moves you what do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen\nWho is in Alaska on coast to coast am Karen\nHi um this link and when she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it does show was short um first of all I wanted to say you are by far my favorite\nShow host in the ass to gorge but you\nSeem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because they do that [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just\nYou know yeah you know I I I guess that it's funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you know you really you're new to say that oh no truly don't what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things that I'll get off the air and everybody else can put in a sense where um than Mandela Effect first of all uh you probably heard about it\nThere's ... million last memory to\nYeah will laugh about well they say false memory\nThey were being in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gay wisdom I Believe it was I say I live in six in the Bible the wolf in lam versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the land\nBut a couple of other examples and and it's an any Bible you can find a accept gifts to what I got catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer 'cause he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like why did\nI don't know thrower comfort or ... remember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it\nSo Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolates you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate\nRemember when she said her really liked me like me are right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says she says you really liked me now\nOkay that's interesting when\nNo not when she was saying encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know portal into another dimension\n... think demon into our yeah well they were doing St panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and mom at the biggie 'cause we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nThe other things that would reduce she'll still be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it out on nightmares more but here's here's what I Want to\nIRS when I propose to do the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and above Mandela about Mohammed is that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this and that this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was ... you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know the the thinking here it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples um I Will say when it comes to a Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns and people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a pro known and putting a person's name and then others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to find you quibble inform the thing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's when I'll be ... ... ... ...

Roy Mackey Roy\nThanks Chris our guest is Dr Deborah thorn associate professor in the department of sociology and anthropology at the University of Idaho she was the lead author of study called the graying of us bankruptcy fallout from life in a risk society\nDirector of foreign just how big of a trend is this bankruptcy is among senior citizens\nConsiderable if we look for example at the national rate so the rate of change in the United states among older folks were filing\nWe've seen a threefold increase since Nineteen Ninety One so that's within the whole US population the other way we measured it is we looked at only the people who are in bankruptcy and looked at their ages\nSo we looked at folks in Nineteen Ninety One and their age distribution compared to what we have now and that's again just the people in bankruptcy and we've seen about five fold increase\nIn the numbers of folks sixty five and over who are filing and this is well beyond\nJust the aging of baby boomers and the United states that only explains a very small percentage of the change\nSo even though the rate has significantly increased overall\nThe number of senior bankruptcies or right\nI don't know if you'd say not a huge number if we look across the United states every year there's only about a hundred only [laughter] there's around a hundred thousand households that are in bankruptcy every year\nAnd of those a small percentage of those are older people however that rate of older people has been going up significantly and and the population of bankruptcy filing here they are way over represented now\nThe subtitle of your study use fallout from life in a risk suicide you maybe you can explain what you mean by that\nJacob hacker he's a social scientist at Yale he introduced the concept of a risk society and our research I think our findings fit well into this perspective that he's introduced\nIn a nutshell risks that used to be managed or held by society at large I think for example people who had tensions back in the day\nThose that risk of retiring\nWas managed by their employer employers also used to provide a post retirement healthcare few do that anymore so that risk of health care has been shifted onto the individual for example who's retiring and\nYeah the shift that we've seen for example this was important we've gone from a defined benefit retirement programs a pension\nTo defined contribution which is a four O. one K. type of retirement\nAnd you're a defined benefit or your pension the investment of that the distribution of that when you retired was all managed and the risk of it was too old\nAnd it was managed by an expert now with the four one K. that risk of that investment has all been transferred to the individual and the choice of making\nAn investment so it's how much are you going to contribute if you're going to contribute and who manages that investment I'm fortunate at the university we have\nSome advisors where to put our retirement money but many people don't so that risk that used to be pooled and managed at a corporate or governmental level is now being shifted off on the individual pretty risky it's it's a risk shift\nOr just one into track is professor Deborah Thorne from the University of Idaho she was the lead author of study called the graying of us bankruptcy and we're talking about her findings that bankruptcy among senior citizens is rapidly rising stars or throwing or more people entering their retirement years carrying debt such as a mortgage\nYeah both\nMortgage debt and a lot more secure debt which is primarily credit cards\nWe've done some research in the past and we know that on the credit cards a large portion of that is medical debt so yes they are going in with more mortgage debt which will be secure debt and the pickle there is\nDepending on which chapter of bankruptcy they file and how much equity there's a lot of moving parts here but how much equity is in their home and what state there and they could end up losing their homes which is just about them rotten is thing you could do to a person who's retired is to take their home\nAnd another paper I'm working on right now I'm finding that\nFolks were sixty five and over you ask them what they did to try to avoid bankruptcy they're older approaching retirement and\nAnd so they stripped their four O. one K. to pay their credit card debt and then they end up filing for bankruptcy and that's just about the worst thing that could happen because now they're approaching their final years and they have nothing\nThey have no wealth they have nothing in their retirement accounts\nLet's talk about medical expenses were just a moment I think there's kind of a misconception out there among younger people would say there is a Medicare and maybe even a cage but I've read that the typical Ruth Irene needs something on the order of two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars just run out of pocket expenses for health costs\nDown in their final Twenty years or so you bet the fact that younger people\nThis is often linked to long term mental health challenges as well young people may experience emotional distress depression even suicide or self harm and of course if this continues into adult relationships where they're more likely to experience violence from their adult\nPartners then again you have long term\nMental health consequences fortunately it's a small proportion of teens and it is declining this was one of the first studies it's actually been able to look at trends in dating violence where we can go back ten years and see that in fact\nThe rates are coming down a little bit and that's good news but we still have more to go\nNo team should be experiencing violence in their relationships\nAnd picking up on that do we know why the violence\nWe can't say for sure but I Do think that some of it has to do with the program but do get offered in some schools where they talk about healthy relationships and talk about dating violence\nTried to change those norms about dating violence and so I think that made contributed certainly conversations on the Internet and you know Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and others that do talk about what\nPeople deserve in relationships and what healthy relationships look like may be contributing to this change\nWhat role does bullying play and the violence among teens who date\nI Do think that in some cases the folks who are engaging in bullying are just as likely to be engaging in violence in terms of their personal relationships or romantic relationships so\nThe young person who's going to say snarky things in public about\nOther people may also be making those same kinds of controlling and negative comment in their romantic relationships I think a tolerance for violent is one of those things where\nYoung people who turn to violence when they're frustrated or as a way of solving their problems maybe more likely to be involved in dating violence as well so\nBelieve may be more likely to be involved in dating violence but I think they are different circumstances and it's important to recognize that we need to identify how to manage conflict and how do you have healthy relationships whether those are those intimate relationships or just general friendship\nHas the me too movement had an impact on whether there's less violence among teens who date\nThat's a good question and one we can't answer yet my hope is that the conversation that's gotten started\nHas created an opportunity for\nMore Frank conversations throughout adolescent communities as well and that people can actually create some useful dialogue around what healthy relationships are how people perceive sexual harassment and sexual violence and what we need to do as a society and\nAs young people in creating those opportunities to have healthy relationships\nDiscussions I Hope among parents and their children are there enough resources to help them have that important discussion the parents and the kids\nI think there are a number of resources on the Internet in terms of healthy relationships and there's definitely a variety of groups I Do think it is important that parents teachers and even other adults can help prevent that dating violence by talking about healthy relationships even before the first day\nProfessor Elizabeth say WIC thank you so much for joining us today you're very welcome for info track I'm gene that's a desk go\nYou're listening to info truck a production poster implication

which is okay I'll take a turkey Tom don't name on it makes it harder\nTry our new nine green we did you mean jobs we were yeah [noise]\nThe surprising study has found that the addition of refined cyber to processed foods may not\nBe healthy and might even trigger liver disease info drank surely Mickey is back with the story really\nThanks again Chris Dr Andrew gr words is a professor in the Institute for biomedical sciences at Georgia State university and co author of the study so darn through your words we see products on grocery store shelves all the time and say high fiber or added fiber and so forth\nAnd you took a look at some of these products and came up with some rather disturbing results tell us a little bit about your study\nOur results are based in mice and we were trying to examine if we could add these fibers\nTo process mouse diets and reproduce some of the beneficial effects on metabolism that have been purported to be attributable to fiber\nAnd indeed adding the fiber did seem to help out the metabolic profiles of the mice However I'm very disturbing to some of them I started to develop liver disease particularly liver cancer\n... I think when people see the word fiber on a product they assume that what's being added do somehow a natural healthy component but where does that fiber that processed fiber really come from what is it\nThere's nothing wrong with the processed fibers per se we can take these same processed fibers which are isolated from healthy foods\nAnd we can add these fibers into a normal mouse diet that is already rich and fiber and there seems to be no ill effect\nOf adding extra fiber to a diet that naturally rich and fiber the problem seemed to arise when you add these fibers to a very highly refined diet that's when we're really seeing problems so this would not be a concern\nFor someone who's eating foods that are naturally rich and fiber but it is a concern for having highly processed foods and an enriching them with fibers certain snack bars for example are pretty refined products and these purified fibers are being added to them\nAnd what processed foods do you most commonly see on the shelves one of those popular items that might be in this category of processed foods that have these added fibers\nSome snack bars one example is the fiber one brownie that has a lot of ... or sugar cane fiber added and that's one of the ingredients that seemed to promote the cancer phenotype and arm I ...\nI Would say it's often things that are meal replacement type of products that would tend to have these and some snack bars that are being fortified these fibers those seem to be some of the main offenders\nThere were also cereals that are marketed as being high and fiber are those also in the same category of concern\nA lot of the ... that are high and fiber are naturally high fiber of the fibers not at its I don't think these will be a concern and until recently the added fiber could not be listed on the label this was a change made by the FDA just within the last year so if in you'll in is\nAbout six months ago it would just be listed as an ingredient but they couldn't claim it as being part of the fiber content so cereals that have been around for a long time that are rich and fiber would not be a concern but it surely is talking about this more recently engineered products that are um really being enriched\nThen if you look at the list of ingredients will you actually see you and you'll enlisted as an ingredient\nYou will so and then when will be lifted ingredients sometimes it will say ... or ... or ...\nBut that will often be listed as an ingredient and it's always been lifted as the ingredient but now it can be listed\nIn the fiber content as well and then you and will be the red flag for you\nIt would be yeah it would be a product that I Would try to not eat at least excessive amounts of and that's some of the fiber and rich products are being consumed in abundance by consumers thinking that they're promoting their health but we think some of this is risky oppression\nSo do these findings surprise you\nIt did surprise us we were definitely not expecting it we did not set out to find problems with diverse we set out\nTo understand the beneficial mechanisms\nLong term we think that there can be potential to engineer foods with these fibers to make them healthy but at present with just don't think the knowledge just quite there\nAnd that consuming the fiber enriched products is a bit risky and people would be better off consuming foods naturally rich and fiber\nThey do yeah occasionally but by and large we we want to have their parents in the pit bull target or the kid and we trade off once in a while a motion and with that that allows us to get that kid out there and shooting rather than just pulling the target\nOkay you know how often do you have matches or on the unity is for people to come out and shoot with you\nOnce a month okay there's always a sometimes two or something but not in what many\nYeah not during the summer months so as a hundred and ... our very few I may Jerry I go out there and shoot were dedicated shooters I don't care what the temperature is or were dedicated but yeah most people don't go after ... it's just too hot\nTo have a vintage rifle match oh a once a month on a Saturday\nAnd we have a a dedicated a and R A\nMan named match like real shoot that yep across the course which is two hundred three hundred six hundred yards\nBoats or fire rapid bar and then we'll shoot I'm six hundred three times mid range man and then the long range match three times six hundred alright on at a thousand right and like this Sunday we are going to have that one thousand yeah\nOK so really I guess check the website everything's going to be posted there as well just everything is posted in which they are and we have a couple more minutes before we we have to leave so I did want to touch on an important topic that's part of the club is on high powered rifle and pistol club humor is also a C.

P. rifle humor that met our HP rifle Yuma gotten that I think you again for joining us okay so you are from I'm going to be and this has been another desert digest\nHello welcome to another edition of desert digests I'm your host Cody decent and today we have a very special guest in our studio county school superintendent Tom ... good morning Tom good morning toting glad to be with you hey thank you for joining us saying I I think everybody knows commentary 'cause you are the one that represents all of us on our on our schools\nOn every school district or I should say school has their own administration but you oversee everybody\nYeah ... ... in a in a way I Do I mean sometimes\nTo pretend as the king of all the other ... protests this mess that really the case but those to protest worked for their ... but I worked very closely with them in their districts to provide a hopefully very quality education programs in Yuma county but you know I just\nThink of if there's one go to source for information and education I go to you because you know about the high schools you know about the elementary and middle schools and everything in between\nUh yeah you know I I think that that was the case at least you know enough I I Do yeah and and the other thing is is that uh if somebody has lived in Europe all my life now uh I have that connection with not only our schools but the community\nAs a whole and that's one of the great things about my job is that it's I think it's a really good community job\nWell ... and you know you've been in education all your life I have a ... in the classroom out of the classroom in administration\nRight I've been a teacher and a basketball coach and a a principal and the central office administrator and now county superintendent\nI Love it so you know as you are let's see when you first entered the classroom and your first teaching and coaching on how do you feel that that environment for for what you first were introduced to um is compared to today I mean what what are the teachers walk into today\nWell that's a great question and and I think one that's really an important one to ask I you know I I in some respects I I had a great experience ah when I first started and one of the reasons that I went into education is we because I wanted to go back\nAnd to teach and worked with people who had been teachers of mine at ... high school and so I had that opportunity waiting for me when I graduated from college and so I had a great support system\nBut ah I I think one of the big differences between then and now is that a essentially what I started with for the most part was what I had learned in school and then I sort of gathering of my own I think uh in today's ah education system ... county but across the board\nThere is a a lot more training and support that is given in I think the the expectations\nOf our teachers probably are a lot higher and different than they were when I first started\nI like I can see that yeah I mean there's been a a a lot of research on a lot has been developed in education so I could see how absolutely are kind of coming into\nThe ... that's that's a good climate there's really a lot more if that's you know I've I've been\nAn educator now almost fifty forty eight years and and the and I and so I've really had a chance to see the the way things have changed in the science of of learning you know how the brain works those kinds of things have that there's really a lot of\nGood information and scientists associate with that that helps us up our students learn\nI mean after college in in going back to teach at a high did you ever think you'd be doing what you're doing today\nI Know if I were beyond knee deep into it I you know I had ... I thought I was going to be a teacher and a basketball coach my whole life that was you know that was my passion and I think to the good lord just had some other things that he wanted me to do and and I'm doing what I got my legal ... what I should be now\nA a good deal um I I ran into you a week or so ago at a movie and wanted to ask you to come in and talk about this movie I shouldn't say movies weren't documentary and it was put on by Tucson values teachers they they funded this documentary\nUm and it was it was a an event that they screen here with a human education advocacy council and are expecting\nMore Arizona which is our our our partner and uh yeah it's a the ... the um education advocacy council or has been in existence for about oh I'd say around two years now and\nIn the beginning we had a small group of people I'm Shelley melon Rachel Barclay Linda Elliot Nelson and myself kind of sat down and kind of of thought it would be great to have an organization that would that would advocate for education and the county\nProvide uh hopefully more information about education you know being in Yuma sometimes we're a little bit insulated from what's going on in the rest\nOf the states so we thought there'd be a chance to just create some awareness as far as our community is concerned registration and by the same token because I think there's a lot of really great things going on here in Yuma or to also have an opportunity to make sure some of those things with other people so we hit on this idea expect more Arizona\nBecame a partner with this and asked us to sort of pilot for other rural communities in the state of Arizona which we've been happy to do and and what we're starting to see\nOur other ... other organizations like ours I'll pop up in other parts of the state so we aired the dot the documentary that you're talking about first in ... county and then there will be some other communities are I think like Stanford samples next that will be showing the same documentary and and having the same panel discussion and we did\nOkay because really the documentary and it's titled teaching in Arizona and you can find out more from the Tucson values teachers organization in Tucson they're the ones that are funded this project but\nReally it's a state wide issue it is it doesn't matter if you're in Flagstaff for human or Tucson we're all feeling the the the need\nExactly or you know the we had the first of all and you were there it was I was a great evening we had over a hundred people who attended\nIncluding some people who are preparing to become teachers and and as I said a minute ago in addition to the the the video self which I think it was about twenty two minutes long then we had a great panel discussion moderated by our our community college president Dr Daniel core\nAnd what it focused on war the I'm kind of the daily teaching lives of three teachers in the Tucson area\nSome new pills Vicki you're doing great so

winning [noise]\nIt's not so unusual for parents to provide some financial support to their children to help them get started in life\nBut a recent study shows the dollar amount of parental financial support has exploded here to explain his ... CEO and founder of age wave which code develop this study with Merrill Lynch\nCan tell us what's your research showed as to how much support parents are giving their kids annually now\nWell ... we've always known the parents you know support and provide a lot of care and love and financial backup two children two toddlers I mean that's just considered sort of normal that's just a part of the exercise but when we saw how much that was calculated to be back in the Nineteen sixties\nThe average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen were twenty five thousand dollars\nToday the average cost of raising a child to the age of Eighteen is two hundred and thirty thousand dollars which is a lot yeah\nBut they're real kind of shock came when we went beyond the Eighteen year olds there's been a lot of talk Chris the last years about boomerang kids and the idea that are twenty five or thirty year old because of the high cost of rental housing and paying down college debts\nAnd you know inability to kind of get launched a lot of those kids are living with their parents and we found that indeed that is true\nThirty one percent of all American between the ages of Eighteen and thirty four are living with their parents which is the most common living arrangement among early adults more people do that they live with a spouse roommates or by themselves\nBut what really knocked us out of our seats was we began to calculate beyond that you know having your child sort of in your house and you're providing\nGroceries and maybe let them watch your Netflix we found out that there were five hundred billion dollars in addition spent by parents on their adult children subsidizing their cell phone bills the rental costs helping to pay down debt\nSending them modifications which turned out to be twice as much as what those very same people were putting into their retirement accounts which was two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year\nYeah I was going to ask about how that compares to the retirement numbers so it seems like a lot of parents may be sacrificing their retirement years to keep their kids going\nSince this study launched some of the reflections are hey what what those kids do they even realize that they're taking so much from their parents other people have said hey you know what\nParents seem to like it it's sort of you know the next stage um helicopter ringing hovering wanting your kids to be competitive to live comfortably to be happy\nTo get the best shot at a good life but the concern is is that those very same well intentioned parents and maybe even well intentioned kids could be jeopardizing their own retirement security because if you have on average seven thousand dollars a year or going out to each child drafts\nIn their own retirement security because if you have on average seven thousand dollars a year going out to each child throughout their young adult years that's a lot of money and many of those very same people can't even afford their own bills\nAnd their own retirement savings building that nest eggs so to take so much of their resources\nAnd continue to support their kids is worth of discussion\nWe're talking with Ken ... CEO and founder of age wave and we're talking about a study\nThat reveals how large the amount of money is that parents are giving to their adult kids we're talking about millennials kids here I think what age range or the parents who are contributing all this money or these boomers primarily or younger\nIf we're looking at what are called early adults which you're Eighteen to thirty four year olds that side of the Census Bureau and sociologist categorize that the parents are going to range anywhere from forty to about Seventy\nSo they're boomers and Gen ... often in the peak of earning years of their lives so they might be feeling kind of flush\nBut on the other hand we know that about half of those people have almost nothing save for their own retirement\nSo it may be short sighted\nFor so many people and by the way in Ninety two percent crash of parents are providing some subset of the nation of their early adult children so it's not just middle income it's not just high net worth it's not people who are modestly resource it's kind of everyone\nThis has become the new normal and we have never before in American history and maybe world history\nSeen a situation like this I Know I was born in Nineteen fifty one I was growing up when you turn Eighteen or twenty or\nGraduated school you're pretty much on your own right and in fact if you ask for money or handout from your parents I was something you were a little bit ashamed of and you work in a live at home with your parents 'cause ours balancing today\nIt's become quite normal and it's hard to know if these parents are powering their kids by helping them out or as they say and ...\nAnd therefore weakening them but this discussion is got to be had this is a new phenomenon these young people are taking a little bit longer to get launched and their parents had generously are trying to help them along the way but they may not be able to really afford it\nCan't why do you see millennials struggling to launch you know their own lives is it because of student loans or is it the cost of living in the rent cost in major cities is there a single factor there\nI think there's a few forces one of them is that back in the Nineteen sixties the cost of a public college was about five hundred dollars per year for tuition now it's about ten thousand\nCosts for a private college back then was about three thousand dollars a year now it averages thirty five thousand dollars a year we've been worried about the cost of automobiles or gasoline going up\nNot a one hundred percent causation but I think that you could build a strong argument that weather and\nThe increase in the national temperature probably had some effect on the increase in murder between two thousand fourteen into the sixteen I wouldn't argue that it's the main driver but they're certainly does appear to be evidence that it could be a driver and\nOne would expect that in places like rural America where you might only have a handful of shooting victims it may only mean if you've got more hot weather and they only need one more shooting victim per year\nBut they're Eighteen thousand agencies that report data to the FBI and the uniformed crime report so if you've only got one or two more shooting victims here one or two more shooting victim tier one or two more murder victims here it adds up over the course of Eighteen thousand eight in the\nIn a place like Chicago you may have fifty more shooting victims over the course of a year if it's hotter versus if it's colder in a smaller place in America you may only have a handful more but nationally when you put it all together I think it adds up\nWhat do you think is behind this trend I'm sure you have some theories in\nMind well I think theories is the operative word here because I don't know that there's a definitive explanation and there's nothing in the data that necessarily shouts one explanation I Do think that it's plausible that a little bit of the explanation is temperatures flare I've never found that to be the most compelling explanation but\nSome of the experts I talked to seem to think that that is at least plausible I think just the general availability of people outside when it's hot out people go outside\nAnd they spend time on their porch and they hang out and they play basketball and it's much harder to find a shooting victim if everyone's inside and avoiding the twenty degree snowy weather one of the explanations is also that when it gets warm enough people who may not\nBe a more pleasant experience to be outside and to be hanging out and to not be hot sitting inside so one of the economists I talked to point a to a paper that that that air conditioning can be a significant factor\nIn determining in something like this and one would think that the same underprivileged communities that would have difficulty with air conditioning and having that widely available would also be the types of communities that are affected strongly about gun violence\nSo Jeff what are your thoughts on the future regarding climate change and the crime rate\nObviously climate change is a concerning issue for lots of reasons I think crime is just another reason why climate change can be incredibly concerning\nFor me I think the major takeaway from this is that we're always looking to find explanations for why the murder rate rose so significantly between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd there have been tons of theories thrown out there and I think the one that daring us right in the faces that it was just warmer and twenty Fifteen and twenty sixty and then it was in twenty fourteen\nAnd if whether can have a major impact that can help us to understand why murder rows and I don't want to say not panic or not celebrate one murder goes up and down just because of\nThe weather but the more we understand what Dr gun violence in our cities and changes and gun violence in our cities the better we can understand what we're doing against it\nJeff Asher the crime analyst based in New Orleans deal the Web site where people can learn more\nI have a blog no low crime news dot com mom on Twitter at crime

McGovern president and CEO of the red cross missing the govern many people want to help with donations first specifically what items would be the most helpful\nWell first of all the American public has had a ... and only feel kind of caught how dire hole that way of health and first of all down a lot we had to cancel a lot of blood died at the earth wind and like all\nThe rules of lettuce dire and above all that's going to their local blood spatter and donate blood that like ... yep we only\nIt is dire and if people can just going to their local blood center and donate blood that would be a tremendous gift we\nAlways can respond shared and volunteers started the life blood and the American Red Cross so anyone that wants to buy here can volunteer to go to a big disaster like hurricane Michael or volunteer right now will last chapter\nWhere leave response you four thousand is that there's that every year and we can always use financial donations as well because any gift regardless decides to see if we appreciate it\nAnd the way they can learn how to donate blood and give a financial foundation or volunteer is just to go on our Web site Red Cross dot org\nOr they can even call her eight hundred number with this one eight hundred spread cry\nAnd in addition to distributing items what other things besides the blood in the central to the red cross due for disaster victims\nTwelve right now in the affected area from hurricane Michael when you have Thirteen hundred volunteers there are twenty seven shelters that are often operational\nAnd two thousand people are living in those shelters and that's the case there were ten thousand we also have Seventy five emergency response vehicles were adding another twenty five and they go in and out of the community and out\nWe provide hot meals and water and lots of the husband comfort there a hundred twenty five thousand meals and snack that we've already served just for hurricane life goals\nAnd we've seen on the

challenge because the numbers cell towers died not doubt we're doing everything we possibly can to break through and help people\nAnd as more roads are getting clear were able to help and more ways\nAnd again in terms of specific items we often hear the the Red Cross and he's like it's sort of clothing any other specific items that would be the most helpful\nTo be perfectly honest the thing that helps the lowest is financial donations we have have warehouses around the country that are stocked\nWith hot and blankets and read anything eat meals done pallets of water and his diapers and formula hiking kid is a nice item so\nReally the best way to people's health is to test donations because it becomes very complicated when people want to chop off items at a shelter if it happens to frequently and actually make it difficult for\nPeople stay in the shelter because it gets crowded out the people on a health thing is ... blood and money\nAnd big picture with hurricane Michael coming right after Hurricane Florence has this one two punch of disasters made it difficult for the red cross to stay ready to do its job\nThat is a wonderful question and I have to tell you we still have four hundred people in shelters for Hurricane Florence\nBut we pride ourselves in the fact that we try to stay in a state of readiness to we have if he'd thousands bonds here is already is poised to add up to me is the answer\nAnd that is critical to be able to respond\nAnd those warehouses that I could rise that we're constantly we stocking them after every single disaster and label to do that because of the financial donation is that people are five\nAnd there's this natural shelters to download sixty thousand different shelters and users pools and churches than it's been since

financial information you hear a new show on demand at usa financial radio dot com once again with Brendan there's here's Marc Mauer is when\nWe have been sharing with you some of our rules for surviving a bit of a market scare\nAnd we talked about rent the importance of\nUnderstanding your risk tolerance understanding more importantly\nWhat your risk score is and then looking at your wrist score and understanding where your portfolio fifth what your portfolios risk score is and making sure that those two things jive but one of the other things that's really important especially if\nYou are nearing or you are already in retirement\nIt might be time for you to rethink your retirement income approach and one of the things that we talk about often on the show is a concept known as the assets cycle portfolio system and the entire intent behind the assets psycho Brent\nIs to try to structure your retirement income and try to think about your portfolio a little bit differently to buy yourself the time\nThat is needed so that the assets that you have that are allocated to the stock market you don't necessarily have to be worrying and spreading over each and every day\nMark and that's so important you know as we touched on very early in today's show when the market in general has a habit of correcting or having corrections of say five percent or more a few times during the course of the year on average a three and a half months roughly going back to the Nineteen twenties\nIt's going to go up and it's going to go down and if you can't stomach it and don't have your portfolio allocated right you're going to have a hard time getting through that without making probably bad choices which gets back to some of the investor behavior stuff we talked about earlier as well\nSo if you give yourself enough time in handle it appropriately that you shouldn't have to worry about\nThe market corrections a couple of times during the course of the year I mean everybody is going to get uncomfortable at some point if we experienced a significant downturn like a two thousand and two thousand nine but again if you've line to your portfolio up properly so that you don't need to be tapping into your equity accounts or your long term investment accounts\nFor say ten or Fifteen Years now you get a lot more comfortable or you can at least work your way through some of those significant dips in the market so\nWhat I mentioned on the last segment before the break their mark about it okay to have different investments inside of your portfolio having different risk or is this is basically an example of it so if we're going to choose some kind of a guaranteed income producing investment vehicle and our portfolio say some type of an annuity\nWith a guaranteed income stream attached to it and maybe it will provide that income to somebody for five ten maybe Fifteen Years and you know what the numbers and you can plan on it\nAnd then if you also have other income sources coming into our Social Security and pensions and things of that ... if you give yourself enough time with those guaranteed income sources now you can get the time in the market on your side because most people off on the ocean\nIf you give yourself enough time with those guaranteed income sources now you can get the time in the market on your side because most people off on the over the long haul the market usually performs pretty decently it's the short term fluctuations and if people try to time it or gas when to get in and out that's when they get in trouble if they would just get a plan stick tight with that\nLet the market do it it's going to do it's going to go up and it's going to go down but if you give her stuffed time it's it's shown that it does perform over a period of time\nHere's the thing everybody has heard the old adage by low so high and and everybody intuitively when you think about that sounds good than it sounds like what we should do\nBut some people in retirement it sounds to me that there's still this approach in the financial industry some people who have structure their income in such a way that they're selling off their equity investments to produce that retirement income\nThey are in a spot to be able to take advantage of that because maybe they're in a spot where if the market's down\nThey're forced to sell no matter what because that's the retirement income that's what they need and so they position themselves either way to be in a terrible spot when it comes to market downturn because they're reliant upon selling those equity investments and maybe they're selling them low\nWent to places that were smoke free [noise]\nI kept on trying and I learned something each time do whatever it takes no matter how many times they

figure out who's behind this here's lonely Gohmert from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but in Nineteen sixteen after Bon Jovi as gang came across\nThe border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people and not only did he point Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's not going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the more you got to stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps DVD I talked to Louis he'll talk about Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big money is that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great\nPoints they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing trumpet of Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousands actually in midterms\nThe American people were all of a sudden we're going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't\nBelieve in what we got maybe a narratives that a gigantic blue way it was going to happen and we had that\nMedia narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue\nWave and Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate\nAnd oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN zone Pullman forty four percent Rasmussen his trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening that\nSuggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I\nEat election day people have to start revealing in these mad and kept for ... projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all that's the case would hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little man and ...\nIs here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house when a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think you'd ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way there is simply\nNo way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never have been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans in a lot of people\nTo support this idea these are so poor people there there's the hungry we'd we we have so much they have so little [noise] we must but that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump will never gotten the Republican nomination if the people\nOf this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or a thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump want to never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd\nGo up you know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them in we should feed them we should house then they have nothing they're poor are coming from ... prepping countries left them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\n\nAnd yet the media reliably\nVery subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan trying to find
