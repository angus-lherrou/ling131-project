opium\nFor medical use what they say medical use sound like medical use marijuana\nShe's not going to rule out anything you could take office December first so it's it's coming up in less than a month [noise] a a talk light on Sunday actually are paying farmers more for corn as a way to dissuade them from planting puppy\nYeah most of the most of the opium and heroin sold in the United states illegally coming out you know out of our southern border\nDoesn't yeah doesn't poppy started growing in Afghanistan anymore I mean I'm sure they are but they're not they're not the major the major importer in the United states now it's farmers out of Mexico for growing poppy\nUm\nPresent also um or president elect al town hall reviews on violence and discuss potential amnesty for nonviolent drug traffickers and farmers\n\nThe amount you know they have like some of the highest murder rates anywhere I mean there's some countries are still some obscure countries that are still hire like Venezuela or something\nBut from what they can count that as well as our downtown they don't have they don't have anybody counting but um the the amount of convictions or like non existent they don't convict people man there is no police officers that are going to rest cartel members and stuff so\nI'm not always that heavily violent it's\nA no convictions obviously they don't have that many people in jail compared to the to this country if we had murder rates like that there'd be more rest and more prosecutions and more people in jail they don't do that but he still discussing amnesty\nFor a non violent drug traffickers and farmers I don't know the cartel guys get in jail a lot of them\nHe wants to evaluate created illegal markets for marijuana end opium\nLike a market so different kind of president we saw it will be someone to watch and see where he goes oh with the country in\nMexico and how much he works with President Trump needs and it's already started off as a positive\n... as far as his acceptance and um when in working unlike to do as a candidate who said he was not going to work with Trump didn't like Trump and was camp kind of get kind of working against him and and then he still did the trade deal [noise] San Francisco now San Francisco is I Am not a fan for a lot of reasons\nYou know I I haven't visited there probably it's it's maybe being close to ten years since I visited San Francisco but I was kinda disgusted at the end just filthy no public restrooms anywhere now I find out now you know as you know they have an epidemic of a ... we don't need restrooms we have sidewalks\nNo you're absolutely right now another thing will happen to watch a ... the ceremony and the White House yesterday you see any of that no\nYou mean with ... with the chemicals that the president and you have an on and I saw a little ... it's a little clips of it but a good for the president for saying what everyone else's thinking now he's a different kind of president he's not he's definitely just wind overtly and apologize\nBrash at times but sometimes you know I'd rather put up with that but he no he straight forward on that that somebody's giving you some kind of slippery off on the side\nHe apologized all joined in the country to the with the family and you see the kids are back with them the wife's back with them and it looks like they're all over it which is good and he apologized which I don't like the law now\nThe Supreme Court justice or they're too I don't think Ruth Bader Ginsburg long for this world she's all hunched over well she had a a blanket over her shawl or something you know he's sitting there on love incoherent and you know that she's been falling asleep alive\nBut here's what you have been taken into account she hates Trump's so much should live for for for his ... for us yeah she just hates him oh I Know which I don't wish anybody a will like it just wouldn't\nLeave there until he was out of office but she's eighty may not be her choice she's eighty five but she's been frail since the day one so yes she will say was bad and now I mean I I didn't get all hunched over and they were helping or and they\nKennedy was eighty two when he retired right just recently\nBut he showed him he was did the swearing in\nI think Brian's eighty three so there's a few of them in their ...\nI'm not saying that she's really gotten decrepit look and she's\nKinda like helping yeah well I get no\nPain at now here I often made me want to look at the Google and I'm shutting down their Google whatever that means I saw that on the thing last night because of that five hundred thousand a\nCrime or where they're private information was given out\nI don't know how they could shut it down you mean I don't know what they're shutting down not sure I don't think ...\nAnd the thing I didn't quite wondering if you saw anything like that or\nA noble I Googled\nA few things this morning it's working so\nWhatever I don't know whatever things I'm not real familiar with a lot of that I Would do on that computer\nYeah and there's so much that Google shutting down ... there's so much for that means so much to the health there there's so much to go\nGo beyond the search engines and there's so many things available I don't even know them all I'd have to get all of a techie\nYeah maybe you can find something on it or I can later on it and that the rhetoric on today\nI appreciate the call but do you think everybody thought it was nice running to call three for for that phone number by weigh three four for five to five eight I with all the cabin on everything else going on and I I guess I got wrapped up as much as anybody but a failed to mention about North Korea now\nThe rest of the world continue to do things and of course this was minister ration is nuts slow we're doing things and Mike Pompeo was just in North Korea again\nAnd he said North Korea is ready to allow inspections\nAnd to missile sites and that's been the big deal it's been one of them is to allow the United nations inspections that into the country to inspect missile sites um that was on Monday says he's ready to allow international groups of inspectors to the ... nuclear and missile sites where we know where they are\nNot that it's not that big a country that we find them I'm sure\nI'm it's and according to sort of goes more evidence of Washington and Pyongyang stalling relationship\nWhich it still hidden in its still hitting in the right direction and then it appears to be more\nThan rhetoric of past and in the past I think the United states was very quick to to to do ahead Jake make an agreement and give the first concession and then North Korea never followed through I think this is different\nAh Pompeo just we do we continue to make progress on agreements made at Singapore summit Trump met with Kim and Singapore in June and at the time announced the two countries are set to start a new history well it's\nIt's continuing on a continuing to show positive signs in an inner has been reports since the summit that\nAre some things around and walk as far as I'm and didn't follow up with a meeting or a a site that we you know you know was showing activity that shouldn't have but but overall it looks like I'm a things are moving along and and I know Korea's been asking\nUm you know for more concessions from the United states and I and I of course we don't know the we don't know the details of what's going on in the in the hearings they haven't made the public but um\nIt's it's pretty obvious if we haven't really given them a lot yeah I Would whatever we're waiting for we're waiting for\nA which is good I'm Glad to see 'em\nArticle years as White House is beginning prepping for democratic legal storm\nSmart\nBecause we're in an election right now and in in this election is is is tremendously interesting I'm seeing how it's changing in in the Republican GOP popularity continues to to click\nGoogle had him at fifty one percent maybe that's why they're shutting down in the current Ronnie or we can have in fifty one percent a but he's above his or I maybe as Rasmussen but he's above where Obama was\nAnd and I don't think that gets a lot of notice um but also the ah\nYou know they they were talking about that a generic vote Democrat Republican you know Fifteen points in favor the Democrats or you know like months ago begin here so\nAnd now I I I think it's a leveled out or just a Democrat is maybe a couple of points ahead or I'd and I don't know recently with the whole cabinet blow up\n[noise] and I think the cabinet blow up has continued to show or the intelligence of the\nOf the Republicans and the Democrats losing their minds\nI I think they have they have done themselves a disservice and I'm I'm thankful for it keep keep it up but but I think that um I'm I'm kinda surprised that they are our our control and I think there there are moves to\nTo um\nPay people to demonstrate their moves to to to do that any um\nUm you know attack U.S Supreme court scratch at the doors screaming in the Senate or all these people that came forward that that that we're not credible against Kavanaugh I I think the Democrats are paying a price for it to take a phone call you on the air\nThe morning\n[noise] I think I got a bad connection that give it another try or whoever I mean I didn't even hear a dial tone nothing but my equipment was turned on but it could have been a connection\nWith the White House's prepping for legal storm a chief of staff John Kelly recently formed these small working group to start prepping for the possibility that Democrats would take Congress\nYeah if they if they get all the committees of they'll they're the White House is fully aware that the committee's will start rapidly working to get a you know legal issues so so they're preparing for that's what the White House can do and that's what they're doing good for them to take a phone call you on the air\nMaurice oh hey blog money on their bailout nice okay American I Know\nI'm not used to like a name I took my finger off the button\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat Republicans are going to win again just like Trump because\nYou're listening to mainstream media crap that's all it is yeah and I'm telling you it's the same thing\nAnd ... you guy it's all just\nOh yeah yeah yeah we gotta we gotta we gotta guess what you ain't got not\nEverybody's tired of it I think all of them that's one item next I\nDon't use Google since they don't support us for conservative yeah use duct duct go they don't trace you don't do anything what's the name of it again I'm telling ya that's not going to search engine and they don't get no kids they don't do anything they just give you the facts I give you the website and let you go sort it out again I've been using it for a long time\nAnd and and are they is it are they is um informative as helpful as Google I mean you think is\nThat you know what they call up the Syrian side by side I mean you can't tell the difference\nIs okay I'm going to take on I'm going to take a look at it I think I heard that before a week or two a trend of mine\n... ... what are the yellow one Seventy seven [laughter] yes he'd been using it for years and so I picked it up a year or so ago I quit using goes I don't

I say impeachment impeachment impeachment impeachment impeachment impeachment impeachment\nAnd the Democrats want to shut up because I think this negativity is what's moving the polls in favor of the Republicans because people see it for what it is it's not leadership it's bringing down the leadership that exist that's all they stand for at this point bringing back\nTaxes demonizing successful people\nShe waters I'm also pushed you know to attack anybody from the cabinet and in a restaurant a department store the gas station you get create a crowd push back on them tell them you're not welcome anymore anywhere anybody works in the cabinet works for President Trump\nThen she says well I wasn't actually calling for harm so I think Maxine Waters is an embarrassment I think Cortez embarrassment but let him keep going don't don't shut them up\nNo means and something else that happened is that Kavanaugh that Kavanaugh saying the Democrats just went over the top\nCrazy over the top just resistance group that's what they've been building Obama's building building resistance groups have always been building resistance group the billionaire left us or building and financing resistance groups\nAnd I think the rest population season for what it is it's fake it's artificial its foe whatever you want to call it it's not a grassroots\nThese are young people being being indoctrinated and brainwashed and many of them have a paid operatives directing an organizing them\nThey're being their ponds and I think the rest of the country sees and that's why we've seen a shift in things\nAnd even and they get so excited going after Cavanaugh I even got things you've got things like that you know this this porn lawyer Michael of empty\nComes up with is a Jewish sweat Nick which is over the top that oh oh not only did did he supposedly do something thirty six years ago um I Know for a fact he was at ten rape parties and drug in women for for rapes\nYeah they couldn't wait to get there just got a pile on there and it doesn't matter what you make up at this point\nAlso been suggested by some democratic operatives and Michael of on today is a Republican just to make the Democrats look bad and I think I think he does but Michaels just showing the hand of what the Democrats are doing and that is hiding the truth not telling the truth\nYou know organizing these protests look the whole Kavanaugh thing was organized by our senators are Democrats senators the screaming at an ad in the in the in the Senate organized they they they they wrote emails and organize the whole thing\nThe thing that the justice ... organized or the the the thing going after I'm Jeff Flake and the elevator organized\nScripted organized there is no grass roots grassroots are joining in because they think it's real so there's a will go join I'm sure and the organizers will help direct them\n\nBut even this creepy point porn lawyer jump in and saying that we're going to get Trump and all that because he's jumping on this bandwagon\nIs overplay and the Democrats and and he's like exposing them for what they are and I think that's what people see it's not just that they have the Eighteen to twenty year olds out there that are naive uninformed misinformed and and manipulated\nSee and and I don't think that's hurting as badly as we think I'm not disagreeing with ... says that we don't need to get to them and and do more for them than to allow them to be brainwashed and I think I think some of that actions happening I think because they the the institutions of higher learning or overplay in their hands\nWere started off as safe zones and boring anybody that's conservative do allowing the attack of people that are conservative and the people are fed up with it and you're seeing those colleges lose registration\nLose funding\nAnd it's a it's about time and how you got Gavin Newsom jumping up and say maybe maybe we're too progressive\nEven in San Francisco where we're passing out needles in supporting supporting people not working and supporting drug habits you got built or hit bill Hillary Clinton telling states like ... or telling state like Wyoming to shut up\nTelling people that supported Trump deplorable because their arrogance they think they run everything they can't believe that somebody like that that that that wasn't a progressive and part of the elite group of the progressive one because Trump is just a regular blue collar blue collar billionaire\nTom Sawyer billionaire\nHe's been down in white men everyone's attacking white men OJ's right white women are attacking white men because it seems to be\nThe the the play of the day and it's over play it's ridiculous\nYes because because Kavanaugh was accused of something thirty six years ago yeah the allegation was you know how these white men are from white women are saying that yeah there's there's a bashing that goes on that gets to be over the top people see it for what it is and\nMore people flock to sentence sensibility they realize they can't be a part of that it tries people away Tom ... says the same way Tom tom for as you know which is the is the is the leader of the Democratic party right now is no better he's over the top\nAnd I think the over the top is not working\nAnd I think that's what gives us hope it's in but it's it's Donald Trump that's pulled us together Donald Trump has pulled the anti Trump ... the trumped arrangement people that were in the Republican ticket including Ted Cruz into the into his circle\nAnd now he's he's stumping for Ted Cruz and and take cruises learn losing Graham has stepped up and he's no longer a trumped arrangement is not going to be part of his cabinet he states that but he's no longer part of the Trump arrangement\nYou're seeing silence from the people\nOr they're just in significant have gone away that were anti Trump anti Trump anti Trump and they're starting to recognize that everything's working everything's going the right way and they want to support and help and I think it's coming at the right time it's coming at this election\nBut we need not take it for granted and we need every Republican bowed out there today is the last day register if you haven't early voting starts tomorrow I'll turn phones back\nOn [laughter] I'll be back right after this I Am five six they gave you

[laughter] just tell you\nWaited three months for this right\nNow I I've been very patient this is good Gulf whether there's excellent golf I didn't really deserve why people come to humid as white people living yes as for the next nine months right I mean it is just gorgeous here where you can stay up north and get those orange balls and see I'm In the snow yes right spills or\nSpeaking up up north I was in Prescott over the weekend I'm forty one degrees or yesterday when I came home\nI'm Glad he was you or I mean I'm wanting cooler but there's a limit on you and\nYou know one of the most rewarding things about golf is to see your students go on and be successful in life not necessarily a cough yeah a lot of people are going to know this name when I say up and make a cannon who was probably the finest grills golfer\nEver to come out of humor uh got married on a Sunday afternoon at Johns Iraq and uh so uh well my wife and I went up for the wedding and are\nJust absolutely she

to the dollar lasting California versus the desert and there's no difference there's there's absolutely no difference at all so um it'll be interesting to see what a this winter seasons like but I like to get back to our guest choosing Myers\nSuzie is the author of a great book and we were just talking about this before or break a golfer employing a guy from point a is not just about golf but it's about life\nIt's about a moment in time your moment in time\nWhere you have an opportunity to be the absolute best you can be at that very given moment\nAnd not worry about what may happen in the future and not worry about what has happened in the past mud in Gulf yourself in that moment surround yourself with a moment\nAnd then do the very best that you can from that moment and then move forward and it's a it's a great way of thinking I Know that you enjoy that very much rescue team that just gives me you'd think that that's kind of the\nWar and it's even a spiritual thing at times to well it's a cornerstone of communication and oh my goodness yes and and very few people ever achieve that their life\nYes and and we've got usually hear a golf instructor yeah who as turned\nNever thought of applying the Gulf Suzie how did you apply that to Gulf what what uh what's what's slipped on in your brain to make you come up with a\nWell we we all know that like a golf is a microcosm of life and so and for hours on the golf course you're going to experience really high really low and it it learning how to handle all of the income golfers really practice\nYeah when you decide you're going to be a point a on the golf course for four hours\nYou're you can almost being a meditative state of mind it like very piece all because you can't control what just happened\nAnd you can't control the future so well tenure control you can control your thought\nAnd you can control how you prepare for a year shot and then how you react to your shot and it's really just the way that\nAnd so you couldn't control how you prepare for your shot and then how you react to your shot and it's really just the way that um we want to work in life but we get practice for four hours of being there\nOn the golf course and it is a mind body connection and when we can get the mind in the body to work in sync um it\nIt it's just a beautiful time and that's why golfers so intriguing to so many of us but what we really want is we want our everything starts in the mind works\nSo once we make a decision of how we're going to be for the next four hours oh I'm going to play point eight oh oh that means I hear that except that my balls and the bunker okay my balls and I'm like what I get what am I going to do from here and I'm not\nGoing to worry about what I'm going to do on the last three holes I'm not going to try to figure out what my score is and if I ... I have my best score\nOr I'll beat this number because that takes us away from what we're doing right now\nAnd I'm tour player after tour player has been there where they thought about the future coming in and all of a sudden everything that they've been doing changes they they might have been playing a boy day right in the moment and then all of a sudden when they think about the trophy or the score\nYou know the whole body and the mind change and um so it's a discipline\nAnd it really gets to be a lot of fun when you use the word ... de as your key to bring yourself back to where you want to be\nTrue Suzie I'm I'm On a Tuesday in many instructors would have told me I don't think about it just we don't like what do you do them to put them in the in the day\nWell if you're if you're a golfer or you have a golf swing and um your body already knows what to do so it's just like you know how to walk if you were to tell yourself how to walk it was really messed up\nYour walk [laughter] so if you tell your self consciously how to swing a golf club then it messes up the whole synchronization of the movement and we basically have a golf swing inside of us if you're a brand new golfer\nYou have to learn those movements you have to learn the feel of the club you have to learn how to allow the\nFlood do the work no what you had had been playing golf and you have some of these ideas you can really trust that the body knows what to do ... and that's what we really want to do is just allow ourselves to create\nThis picture of what we want and trust that the body knows how to do with\n... exactly [noise] exactly I mean would you you should something there that is so critical to people forget\nAnd that is that a golf clubs tool as a specific usage design just a very very Rich Benjamin piece of equipment when you stop and think about all the orange deemed money going into the doctor you go to paying me only got ... got ... they got\nYou got all kinds of people over there ...\nYou don't get to do it is an engineer ... been for a specific she'll duty hoping nothing wrong with my swing of the room to know you have to run out of trouble [laughter]\nInteresting thing because um I teach the golf club first and foremost\nYes you do and I like to know like a very very much by the way\nCool I'm ... when I get to ask her purse and questions about their tool and they have to answer and figure out what is this meant for it's amazing how people don't\nAnd even after I played on to her\nI and and I was explained how the tool worked I was like oh my gosh nobody explained it to be that way now I can use it completely differently or we think that the tool is meant to hit a golf ball but that's not what it's designed for at all it's really designed to create speed\nAnd if we have those two different ideas the movements will be very different so how you talk to yourself and your intention with what you're going to do changes the way that you knew and so ... what I liked your ... coach at the golf clubs purpose is to create speed and the golf ball gets in the middle of it\nYou know that's a very very good I liked it because oil idea to swinging motion the introduction of some tropical force is acceleration and that's going to do is hitting anything right and\nHitting things makes you end up stopping to hit\nAnd run for re create the momentum we've had this conversation ... and I you know about\nHow do I break the habit of\nWhen I'm looking at the ball on a swing in the club I Want to know where it's going so much I'll start looking for for you to\nYour mom [laughter] understand I understand it the last couple well those are really focusing on we're a much swinging right then and I think you'll see everybody on ... street Yankee Doodle look where the ball was versions\nAnd I'm sure I'm sure it's for your focus on the road you get someone to relax and do the\n... when you have the imaginary scissors that kind of cut the ties to the emotions of where the ball is going and you have to play all these kind of mental games with yourself in order to be very in the first that you could make a movement and simply allow the balls to go\nAnd when when you look up you're like\nPleasantly surprised oh my gosh that was just where I wanted to\nYou know the shark is more like a group [laughter] it does when you make\nA golf throw your golf stroke is what propels the golf ball out there so you don't want to be out there trying to get the ball to go someplace because then you're golf stroke\nDoesn't know what the intention is you asking did your body the intention that you're going to move into golf club from the beginning to the end they create some speed and allow the balls to go\nDo the work that you say to yourself and the pictures you create are or how you start to get yourself drawn back from the target back to where you are right now it definitely takes some practice\nCan you can you look at a golfer in into what they're thinking in other words look at the Gulf or you're you're approaching the Roman your thought process\nWell I think you can you can tell by the emotion because we tend to be do attached\nTo what just happened were either angry or we're happy or we're frustrated or we're anxious and so you can look at golfers and see how they're handling their emotions\nAnd it's it's just like in life you know standing in a long line at the grocery store and my angry and anxious and my you know all of that or I might point eight saying oh there's nothing I can do about this I might as well enjoy my time in the wine and make everybody laugh\nYour body [laughter]\nEveryone a quick reminder you can catch a the desert southwest GOP show with Jay B L U H M ... dot com and are going to the right hand corner until she got little slot up there called pod cast you click on net and uh\nWe got a year and that's where the ... were up there so you can go in you find anyone any show any idea that you're thinking about going to listen to a shoes you'll be up\nThere ah there shall be up there ah and then next year so uh and uh you can always go to work more corrupt golf dot com or you can you can catch the shell deer and uh you can also listening to the show\nAt a a human governed country club uh their website you can go there click on your desert southwest cop show and you listen to weigh a lot of places not a lot of places here will go to her\nAnd you can go to Disney Myers golf dot com and lie about man you light ordered the book it's all on there and um I appreciate\nThat it's a I Would a had a great opportunity to be a part of a PGA hall which market um I er you the director yes mhm\nYeah uh the director of um of our southwest action is that correct that's correct yeah\nUm so we just began our six week program with the veteran down here and see\nAnd um I was fortunate enough to be able to talk to some of the veteran\nThe uh triggers they have and when does it begin to happen they do not know how to control toes and thinking about point in me a would be very very helpful\nLearning how to control those women were maybe the first second or third time that over a period of\nTime or to be able to uh [noise]\nResolve those triggers kind of neutralized them knock them off they're still going to come are still going to happen but to be able to lessen them and certainly lessen the impact of them are would be incredibly important to show many of our wounded veterans\nI'm eighty percent of what we teach a or the students should we teach through PGA hold her ... suffers for TV I uh [noise] and ah maybe I Do that the\nPleasure of working with so many different veterans around the state of Arizona through golf and that is always one of the biggest issues that we face is called constructors is\nHow do we help a person with the TST or you know and and how do we how do we\nCreate an awareness for them to the golf courses not only a a welcome place but it's very safe place don't always tell parents remain gosh what a babysitter for your kid after school seriously crop up with a golf course [laughter] she was telling us in a world\nIt is and and it's interesting that when you're on the golf course talked about triggers um there's triggers all the time on the golf you know I'm\nI I'm playing or somebody that's too slow I'm playing with somebody that's a talk too much wants to get in the last and I\nI'm not putting while today all these are triggers that um\nThat golfers all they start to their mind go all over the place and and the notion of being able\nTo these triggers um if you can say okay well I'm just that point I what can I control right here at this moment I Can't control that person I Can't control my prodding stroke but I can take a deep
