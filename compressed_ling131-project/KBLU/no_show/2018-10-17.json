take care of their uh their their government funding as we say we what we try to do is is moved to wars that we're still in it the more try\nThen last year defending domed or the federal government if you're on the Indian affairs and not all of us right now I'm not speaking for them because there are some that have that needs to have the the the the federal government as as an arms to Leno\nOr not all tribes now have that luxury of being self governing yeah now but uh we're very fortunate here as as chairs decent and probably the five tries we meet quarterly the terrorists ... costs the secret sauce decreasing the seminal we represent eighty percent of the whole population Oklahoma\nMost of us are still governing we we do not just in that much still in the European in there we go straight to the Washington DC when we have an issue we bypassed the bureau leading a fair\nI've been there when you're doing that so [laughter] yeah\nIn ... it's not the one other thing I've been one of those things is that is\nIs we've been talking about you know a a an embassy here or the tribes so that they have a place here in Washington DC\nThat they could entertain uses meetings and a number of other things and I go yeah\nMore importantly it sounds like the tribes canal help each other better than\nUh the government can especially and I've been to the ... where are you know the bigger tribes are looking at the smaller tried to saying well first thing you do is make sure everybody stays in school\nYou know I'm you know uh that's one of the big things that we've been seeing and you know the and the chiefs are written very generous between the tribe\nYou you hope for more of that\nYes it'd be a good example is the the shock therapy out of\nOut of Minnesota they actually give loans to other tribes that are in need of 'cause they do very well in in the gaming business operations which is a good precedent for other tri state\nUh and and that's what I think it'd be just very similar to the corporate world\nOr some some some corporate companies are doing real well and they're able to help smaller companies with or get in get them get their feet off the ground so yeah we ... we look at each other we're getting ready to have our our large annual\nSeventy fifth annual or a National Congress American Indians meeting in Denver\nOr this coming weekend and I'll be flying out Saturday morning\nThat'd be over two hundred and fifty tribal leaders they're talking about uh uh Indian child welfare which we really got to address\nOr the Indian child welfare ... the act was in Nineteen Seventy four by Goldwater Barry Goldwater I think a initiated that legislation and uh\nIt allowed Native American than to have first priority adult themes Native American kids when they're up for for adoption\nAnd we we had a a set back in a ruling from the a judge in Texas that says that was not\nThat that was invalid and it was an accident that really we take that to heart that we should be given first preference of adopted and the Native American kids got we know their culture we know their heritage we know their their way of life so yes we will discuss those issues that we get yours\nA chief this is ... which which would you consider a top issue for the nation's overall that may be different for the issues for the rest of America\nOh probably that Indian child welfare is big ah it it really because what happens is we have people that come in and adopt their Native American kids and take them off their their their homeland and and\nAnd again you know we we we are having that epidemic with old opioids right now and this is just across the country is not in it but it's every Friday so that's the biggest union child welfare uh in in allowing us to to\nUh uh take care of our land\nUh we were there we've lost a lot of land in years past\nAnd we're trying to gradually get back our land so we can create a a jobs for people and build houses and\nWhere we're we're on the far right now of building largest health but still they not only in the Indian country but may be a all throughout is that right here in the country is so it's going to be over four hundred thousand square feet\nNow that's going to be a fool hospitals so that would be a\nYeah wow yeah fits in and we did a joint venture\nWith a with the Indian Health service for one the ... tribes are able to do that and it will it'll create a you know probably in another five hundred thousand jobs in our population is Los immunities only like Fifteen or sixteen thousand but we work with our county commissioners\nWe give them a chance to build roads we work with our public schools are we joined we joint venture with our local state agencies to make sure that they have the funds when they're lacking funding to take care of the project and our economy here in northeast Oklahoma\nI Know health issues and you mentioned opioids with health issues are a problem on the on the tribes as they are um everywhere else in America but I ... seems to be even exacerbated on this on some of the trucks I didn't know if you had similar issues\nYes we do in in I'm headed to the gym or this\nMorning as you know no good for you or I\nI think ... what we have to do is we we were reacting too much to us the diabetes that hasn't always been the case for Native Americans when we had our own way of providing food for us when we when we started taking in government subsidies right after uh\nOn the road after depression and the Nineteen thirties taken in government step stay with with high cholesterol food high sodium ... high fat\nWe started seeing an increase in in the diabetes part of our of our society we have we have recently turn that around and started being more selective and our diet in our work out so we're concentrate more on preventive health and we are more to react into the health issues that we have\nI think long term you're doing the right thing and I think the rest of the country starting to wake up we're way behind\nYou cheat or one of the other like Cal to choose what actually ah found it the rest of this year you know I'm working with the smoke free America or to try to get\nRid of cigarettes and go to a if you want nicotine you go to the beeping idea dead and we found a very very good here I'm In the Indian tribes because even though they sell cigarettes or they're trying to quit smoking on a on a reservation\nAbsolutely am here I'm so let me distinguished stuff that we do not have reservations in Oklahoma or the only tribe that could probably argue that would be the oath states is that\nWe in the canyon back in the seventies a that was profit to be native born had Indian land because you could put a business on there which they call smoke shops\nAnd you could get you you are tax exempt so you couldn't make it a good profit and smoke shop started\nSpringing up all over our jurisdiction we has sent really made the the uh the application\nSmoke shop started uh springing up all over our jurisdiction\nWe has sent really made the the uh the application the criteria very difficult because we wanted to hit in that direction as well Georgia being a non smoking area and and it's really increase or or or our way of living better so we have done away with our smoke so we have very few laugh\nBut that's that's a good point\nGeorge we're running out of time my friend\nOkay real quick uh so if I said that I was a that was a church key and I\nBecause of my grandparents and then we found out that I had no connection to the Cherokee tribe I'd be a fraud right\nYes\nAh what their here's the deal with with that\nWe have many people that came right back who they are your eat in in this country are either you you know your your order your pilgrim or your Native American and it's very simple\nCan say that because I Am I Am for for care speak the language that that was my first language chaired the ah there's many people out there that that that climate\nAnd if they're doing it for the wrong reason for an advantage to either get funding or grants from the federal government then that's wrong a job we don't we take that their or job we we take that very serious so yes in order to become one of us\nAre you have to come and prove yourself there's a system you go through and we stay or night and if you are not Native American that's okay we still active\n[laughter] should that so they weren't you know the thing is the thing is is that called the cultural appropriation but it's weird to\nBecause the first thing they would do the funny to come in well\nI'm a quarter carry on their ... so it was popular for people who want to be an all girls Gore's for a while and not all the ... will than me\nThey

lot of these programs have been running for years we just running because we've run them and they're not efficient so it's time to work on a reducing\nThey'll sell people tomorrow I'm Down in key Greg and talk to him don't yell adding\n[laughter] there's a lot information era wake him yelling at our table lack of a shitty anyway as far as I'm concerned in the city where it's pretty hard I I watch our workers and stuff around town and they stand to be doing a pretty good job daycare\nYeah no I think they do care may not agree with what they care\n... and something else that I noticed a a low perform on one for ah\nThe roads are their city roads right LA they forgot to put it on my ballot\nWhere you live in the city yes are you in a are you in a county island or something\nNo and yes you know like I say none of us are off birthday so so what happened it was kinda funny 'cause I put up the science it is\nOkay and I go I go get my ballot out the vote week and I'm not going to stay with them when they vote on it right but ... and even there [laughter]\nOh well I Would I Would I Would find out from a from Robin and find out what's going on because that shouldn't happen\nWell I think I think she'd already knows about it and I think it will probably happen to Dale is Jen that's another another voting boating I deal in the mail that we can vote ... on that\nOne reason I called my friend ... do you have a good way you've had in mind that\nHey I'm Bob Johnson send me a a Texan would take him that he ... he knows more about it but I Do but uh\nI Believe the calls about the lights which I found interesting about this last year and I'm sure there's a problem somewhere um solar didn't sound right to me cause or what is she a Bob says there's no solar to it so you know when I don't have any doubt that that's probably true\nOr the other thing is a risky right or it's overseen administrative leave and that's true too I guess I knew that I did do that but I still call Greg Greg will give it to Ricky\nAnd ... they're going to talk regularly anyway they're going to be together on it so\nThey will uh\nAs far as a Stormy Daniels it didn't it didn't finish that a while before I let me get a phone call you're on the air\n[noise]\nMourning mourning ... yes ...\nAnd they said something interesting there in need more money raised taxes yes yeah well uh so much for the or at least the restaurant industry also we need more money raised taxes now what I mean raise prices\nSo much for the or at least the restaurant industry also we need more money raised taxes now what I mean raise prices right now what I wanted to say is this and this has been something we've I've talked about in a while but I got a phone call earlier just before I called you earlier\nAnd there was a story I guess it was on the CBS CNN not CNN to best world news or something that\nWork programs on the right solution but uh for scenes to us but you never know what I mean there's ways to get it done ways to get it done yes\nYou know the bottom line is they get on extended a extended unemployment they get on an extended welfare and the bottom line is if you get fired from your job you can't receive a unemployment there is I think a six week penalties\nAnd all the bottom rung yeah is\nGet these people off of welfare force them to work eight you know what it's gonna be forced to work it's being forced to become an adult\nI remember as a teenager having more violent boy does it does help yes well yeah more people employing you go to a restaurant [laughter] right oh about amongst other things you know there's more money in the community there's more money yeah\n... ... when I was in high school freshmen in high school I was working at shell station\nIt'd be which is a figure a way it is now but uh that's how I got the stuff that I wanted I wanted to founded Gene Gene in my pants you know that change that now the bills\nAnd the gotcha by my symbol for for migrants that it's called responsibility we still got kids doing that today they're still out there not not enough I'm ... I didn't always could use a few more rigid call you got a black man [noise] the um\nAssociated Press says he won't accept blame if he if he loses meeting Donald Trump not true\nReally when he when he answers the question he never said that he says I they ... you know we'll let me take a phone call you're on the air\nThat morning good morning you never accept\nBlame but that's not why I'm calling it\nA missed part of your minimum wage scale there but I Know it's been in effect in Arizona What now two years and we've been at ten dollars and just recently to ten fifty\nI it sounds about why you started you\nKnow before the minimum wage went up though when they passed that now with like three months later when I went into effect right away that was passed I noticed though most of the places where I Do my uh\nShopping or my spending of my money or I go to eat the prices went up pretty much immediately and so much\nOf the places where you go to get services done and everything and I don't know I like to know who does the study and how tilted they could be one way or the or how how true they are how exactly they are\nUm I I really don't think that uh people go out to eat less\nAh you drive by these restaurants in town and they're all busy\n[noise] there's been a number of studies a first one I Know when Seattle did it was a California thing was Berkeley that did it\nAnd they didn't like the results of Seattle then because they supported the higher wage so they had their universities rewrite the findings to find something positive but do the studies have been done and it and it does and we've got a or a W see\nA ... I forget what the professors last name is is uh been doing a her doctorate on studying that and she's been studying for years now and I'd be curious to see I don't know if she's got to find a report out yet or not but there's been some serious studies on it it\nWould be curious to see if if we went back to what the minimum wage was how quickly these businesses would bring their prices down to what they were also\nDon't know but it's not the government's business to keep micromanaging everybody's everyone else's business terrible they should not do it there's too many unintended consequences I don't doubt it\nGovernment is jumping so much in there and\nWhen they started dictating you will pay somebody that's micromanaging yeah whoa whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa wait a minute though when the government dictate something don't they usually do it in the form of a ordinance or a or a statute\nOr something absolute are the ones that last time you saw a statute\nBy people that wanted to raise something or do something you know this was the people that put the referendum yet as opposed to go do this wasn't the state that went through and said what it's going to be\nAbsolutely it was it was our law makers and are lawmakers\nIn the capital of the state capital just say okay this day it's going to be it\nIt was a referendum referendum that went through the voters but it has the same effect okay it's the same effect and uh and then we start micromanaging businesses because we think we know better and we know the incomes the company that\nDoes the government does its fair share of micro managing and lots of lots of different ways but there are some ways it sometimes\nYeah you know when you everybody was everybody's got opinion I get fifty opinions today on how I could make the show better\nNow I Know I I've never given you might [laughter]\nAnd sometimes you get and how you got it morning they buddy by and it's\nA Michelle Sims over there at the college has been

losses if if it hadn't been term losses or would it be outcome would it be a referendum says no I think I'm helping people I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact and they took that as he won't accept blame\nHe says I'm helping people he didn't he didn't say that he's not going to accept blamed for losses and I guess the the a P people figured losses are are on their way I I still

innocent all the way that and we'd already\nDone six FBI backgrounds on cabinet before it ever got there he'd already gone through the the hearing and then they they it through this thirty six year old thing on him\nAnd now there comes a are wanting to compare that a a a\nShaggy a you know rush to judgment on him was they haven't even confirmed these did yeah I don't think they found the body but uh there's a lot of indications that he is and already they're going to blame Saudi Arabia and they've even got details as to the crime which I I don't even understand\nHow they got a lot of people jumping to conclusions and he's against that is pushing back on that\nAnd when he's asked about the campaign aggressively and his rallies all that kind of stuff do you believe he's doing a good job\nAnd heard from supporters that may not voting no memory says he says I'm not running I mean there are many people that just said to me I Will never ever go and vote midterms because you're not

then about October with our first concerts October of two thousand one with our first one that we're on your eight and ... and every year it's gotten bigger and better um British gift\nWhat we do as a as giving back to the community is helping to fight families that are suffering through breast cancer um financially with either it's like rent or with gas or electricity or anything that helps them take away the burden while they're going through this battle because\nAnybody that's fighting cancer of any kind typically most households are two income households in this day and age so an income is lost because somebody can't work when they're going through such such difficult treatment\nSo they're finding themselves struggling to put food on the table and they're finding themselves struggling to pay their utility bills or or to pay their house payment for a month and if we can help relieve that burden in Britain its name I mean that's what this is all about\n... years and years ago team Bridget with the American Cancer Society really for life team Bridgette was one of the biggest teams in the most enthusiastic\nI'm In the most cohesive 'cause it was just a lot of people just loved 'em low Bridget man then when she passed the team kind of accelerated is we're going to do something bigger and different and then of course bridges gift\nI'm your her legacy of giving and caring is personified every single day now and what you do is important\nYour the piece of someone's going through cancer treatments you have a caregiver they're trying to maintain his or his job okay or someone who's taking care of the kids and the bills in targeted insurance company or understanding the protocols\nAnd try to keep their act together right so anytime they can reach out and asked for some help in guys don't do that very well um we're stubborn\n[laughter] down I'm ripping my general and I'm just going to be ... so how do I find out about getting some help is our phone numbers or website and how do I do the best\nPlace probably to get a hold of us is on social media so Facebook or Instagram where we have a presence there uh we have our website which is Britain's gift dot com and then our phone number is seven two three five three eight eight or nine eight seven two three five three eight eight\nBut we do that\nI I think the hardest part for ... for especially for a caregiver\nI can do this or just go will my way through this and I'm going to let myself I'm not going to think about me my maybe my health is waiting may maybe you know I'm gonna take care of myself as well the last thing I Would do is pick up the phone us for help but we want people to call and ask for right now she important part and that's what Bridget would have wanted\nYou wanted to give back to everybody that was there to help her and rallied around for her\nSo if you're over there and you're struggling through this world will disease in him\n[noise] having cancer it's emotional it's psychological was physical or if there's just all kinds of things happen but if you're looking for help or just looking for some answers starts you're married to a seven to three five three eighty seven to three fifty three eighty eight\nSo argument get help with my peers ... hope what if what if the guy just leave a night out look I just I just need a break and I did home for ... for\nUs if we do solely focused on breast cancer because that's our mission right I'm I'm\nReally we don't have those resources but we can refer people to um those other organizations that are exactly and there's a couple of other organizations that focus on that so while we don't provide that we definitely have the information on how to point them in the right\nDirection a source of of just information right ... ... yeah um do you keep tallies on him when he Simmons you how\nWe do actually we are working on I think we're number sixty nine a number Seventy and so that would be that would be significant financial assistance for sixteen under Seventy family since two thousand and eleven\nAgain the bridge it would have wanted okay ... um there's her last days and she she thought about what she wanted and I've heard conversations from you in from Robbie a rubber rigors talking about what she wanted her legacy to be yeah you're doing it\n[noise] yeah we are we are yeah so who was who was the first closer to his or her for the first\nCars on Michael Montgomery yeah his memories are coming up on Facebook actually yeah you know you you you were singing were I think for that concert I did uh-huh how fun yeah you\nHeard was free to convince joined Michael Montgomery to come to you I'm gonna do that\nRobin already kind of had it probably had this mission and he knew what he was going to do from the get go so when he met with everybody he had already kind of light everything up and said this is what we're going to do John Michael Montgomery already agreed we just need to figure out how to do it [laughter] and here we are when Robert Gibbs stubborn like that [laughter]\nI Know so he so we [laughter] I don't know good yeah for sure if these very hashing it about what he does and when he wants something he will go for it\nHe got out of the ... it's hard or anybody any of us know right so yeah he has an idea what we know that that's going to get done at the end\nAnd it has the same concept with proteins goes I Want to do this it's going to happen at ...\n... he was in the teenage years and he always told his uncle and his grandfather that he wanted to take it over and to continue the family dream and someone came available he took that shot and even just due to these new it in it he's leading and been really awesome\nHe's doing it so other than having you know for me

bird prizes well um\nNext year which those or a hot hot commodity and hard to get that we've set aside to for next year will be giving those away in the early bird raffle so if you get there as\nSoon after the gates open at four o'clock as you can you you'll have a chance to win one of these great prices there's more that I haven't mentioned but we're we're getting quite a few things that way\nOr another very big here in connection 'cause that's a good if you can produce a fundraiser through that as well have you been cameras ... are great idea\nWhen they called us there's like are you kidding was a no brainer so if you haven't had any baked ham you just don't know [laughter]\nSo yeah experience yeah yeah [laughter]\nI'm sort of early bird specials which is interesting this kind of fun to talk of the genesis of the razor revel where'd you get even a about a few cigarettes out the the business are both in the reserve will be a brewers tomorrow I imagine it will be there or if it gets dark how good again great idea what was the genesis well the story\nOf Chris reserve it will we ever Chris Miller we love Christmas he's another one of our angels and he actually hosted the paint party Daniel Pink party last year which we are so happy to be a beneficiary of again this year and he had this great idea let's\nLet's wrap lover either so he uh gotten to connection with the dean from razor works and they came up with the plan and presented us with this razor and said let's make this happen so we hit the ground running and and here we are in\nTogether twenty dollars each or you can get three for fifty dollars right which is right and we're gonna rattled off that night so uh uh at the cops are because\nShe Christmas was another one of those guys were able to read or OK wouldn't Martin houses for wild wings he's he's a great contributor doesn't want the fanfare right there's a whole laundry list of men and women in this community that just do it\n... or if that's the right thing to do that and stuff they'll good ... exactly yeah there's a lot of that going on so ... so what are the kind of wrestle prizes you have to moral all the brewers are twenty fourth whatever they be big tickle revenge\nYeah we have I have tons of rubble prices had been donated from the local um restaurants and stores and shops and then we also have some I Apple iPhone headphones and ah\nWhat does that outdoor portable heater nice gift certificates oil changes all kinds of stuff and it will be doing that fifty fifty rifles as\nWell and then a generous portion of the proceeds from the day will will be donated back to ...\nYear we're helping moving your food is this horrible world was these it's I'm I'm a devastate families ... sit down in his mom's going through this was going through it you know it's going through it but it was like for families as well\nSo and you know we go the it's a it's a lot of work it's a labor of love we absolutely love what we do not complaining by any means but it's it's a lot and you kind of go through the motions and you get the ... I don't want to say stuck but you you just get in that cycle going through the motions and and we're doing a job here\nBut when you have those moments that you actually get to connect with one of these amazing ladies and these families that were helping\nThat that just speaks volumes to to the inspiration the motivation of why why we're doing it that we're doing it for them in Britain its name and to know that we can just give them that that little bit of relief to get by for a month or two\nEn en route and on the heels of what you just said John at it is all about the fun of the evening but we do talk about the mission we do remind everybody about\nWhat Bridget gave up and what her dream was that we can give her a gift to the community um because ... obviously we're there to help raise some funds so that we can continue Bridget stream and and giving birth to skip to the community\nThinking in the community for what they're doing because without them I mean we wouldn't be here right and like if I wrote that every time we can say thank you that's\nYeah because we said thank you for helping us help humans who are fighting breast cancer and we got to mention that without our title sponsor who step up every year Fisher Chevrolet excuse me Fisher automotive groups are sorry about that a Fisher automotive group has always been so kind and generous to help us era title sponsor this year\nWe couldn't do what we do without the foundation of human regional medical center they took us under their wing and were able to operate with their guidance um again thank thank you to them and then for ...\nBut we can't even begin dementia thing that she ...\nHer she went out at ... out there and it ... down like amazing we can\nShoot a go getter right I'm In the heart charger

to\nYou do a great job of thinking sponsors I mean you do a great job of living I mean even from the smaller smaller sponsored forbid ones you do a great job of saying thank you\nThank you ... if if they want to make sure nobody goes unnoticed for sure\nHer to do shows you're going to get somebody that has ever heard of this testing we tried hard not to do with\nYour hard work too because again the meetings or non stop 'em if you go ... teams is going to be a bridge is give meeting going\nPlenty of voters may not mostly mouth yeah that's our go to agree with you and your ...\nThis is going

the time we needed breakfast of our volunteers out there this week she's out they're delivering waters or muffins or breakfast sandwiches and stuff like that just to keep them field and going throughout the entire weekend out yeah\nDiscovery them away you know when you move people say how can I Hope it's not rhetorical\nThere really weren't elite or because they're going to cost you anything in return ... right right right exactly so you think about the major sponsors you got your Fisher of the automotive\nGroup you got ... uh again you in all the median tone to these really step up to really put\nAll over that we can't even we can't thank them enough again that's another call that goes out and they don't even hesitate and the coverage that we're able to have on all of the media outlets it helps us promote and and get this word out and couldn't do without them either so thank you tell me if you agree [laughter]\nI'm sort of talked about to raise the retirement so at the event itself you have the typical stuff there's there's raffle tickets there's a quote raffles what else you got going on at the ...\nThere's a fifty fifty drawing in an because our mission is breast cancer um assistance or we typically can't go outside of our mission but Stacy if you want to talk about that\nYeah last year started um with the idea and we came about to be able to help other\nPeople that are dealing with cancer that we can't that aren't affected with breast cancer\nLast year we helped out ... with his um cancer battle and so this year every year we're going to try to pick a do an infant recipient so this year we're having a John Kerry and his family out there there'll be selling their fifty fifty but the route put tickets in all the proceeds from now we'll go to help him and they can ... right\nRight and he's fighting\nI'm not sure that yeah we're not sure about that but we know it's not breast cancer so\nWhich do gosh or it's like I said earlier I'm\nBeing told you have cancer just changes your life forever it does um and again you affects the whole family and for you to do what you do in\nStep out of your own lane if you will and said here's others we can help at this venue right in it to be able to share that there are huge and there's also the way we are when\nYou press it so hard to say no and when we know that somebody else is going through that battle that we are so close to it I mean it's hard to say no so if there's any that we the way that we can help out that river covers his when he was never said no [laughter] I don't
