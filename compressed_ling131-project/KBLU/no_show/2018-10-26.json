will be in the toilet because his biggest item he talks about is how much money is made you change the economy by killing business that is gone\nNow you know people are now at a business there is a few\nDemocrats who are on the phone with Bill Maher on his show actually we're saying yes we can cause a recession we'll get the White House back\n\nAnd I almost fell out of my seat when I heard ...

politics of it you just follow the the fallout\nI guess I don't care I mean I was a supporter of of all things Bill Clinton in the nineties because he had this concept of hands off the Internet right and that was great I said so yes this is a good thing his hands off business in the in the United states grew how do we had a democratic policies of today back then\nChina would have led or ... or Ireland actually probably would have led the Internet revolution of the nineties and early two thousand\nYou know there's a feeling out there whether we're in is you know whatever kind of economy we're in people that uh pay attention have wealth or going to continue to grow because you're going to invest in the right things you're going to find the markets wherever they land regardless of where they land because you're his own swivel looking for that\nThat's what I Do I mean this is the guy when I say you know when people say well it's only the finance ears whoever make money in any market ice and that is true because of the guys who are on the baseball field for the MLD or bad and the you know the home runs that's what they do ...\nYou know they figure out how it works and I'm not stock unfortunately because I have a family and we have people who rely on us for employment I have to say All right oh I have to make money and I have to close down a factory in a U.S because of regulations are killing me I've we closed on the factory in us we move it someplace else\nRight and and you know here's\nI Will give you an example of terrible regulations in the state of Hawaii which I Am a registered voter\nI it is cheaper for our rental groups to buy cars in Phoenix, Arizona you know I thought you liked us and float them across the Pacific it's cheaper to do that than to buy them in Hawaii which double taxes to me\nIf I were to buy them because of the business buying them and then it charges me the value on top of that for bringing in from out of 'em from inside the state so it's cheaper for me to flow cars a fleet across the Pacific than it is the buying the state of Hawaii and that is because Hawaii is overly it's a one party state\nRight wow and the people figure that out there will be a cottage industry of floating cars\nOh there's during the ... this is a common thing there are six companies that do this for the rental car companies to do is slow cars across the Pacific\nIn in in the politicians wise haven't figured that out yet that we need to change something\nYou can ask them and they'll tell you that it's all the other parties fall and that's what you know the newspapers will roll and Hawaii is biggest problem right now is affordable housing right I'm that is the current governor took land that had modest home is on it allowed\nOn that is the current governor took\nLand that had modest home on it allowed them a ... a a group to come in and tear it up and create million dollar condos and then blamed the two Republicans in the state Senate for the lack of affordable housing\nOn that made national news yeah I remember [laughter]\nAnd then this is the Honolulu cars that in Honolulu star does echo his appointment that is the Republicans in the Senate that are causing us to lose his housing\nRight and then the whole the whole what a five percent of a voting if they're lucky on that\n[laughter] amazing how the the politics works a new idea the I'm the tech industry's we've got to keep pushing the thousand dollar phones even though the economy may soften up out for the if if if the Democrats take now\nThe question for that is what do the cheaper models have to offer I have seen a few algae phones I've seen a few\nUm you know Korean phones that are you know in the three or four hundred dollar mark area that are pretty decent so it really comes down to the availability of what is the\nThe competition offering and this is where a true capitalism will come into place I I mean I'm a huge and then I'll make this a Samsung fan I Love Samsung but I still carry a blackberry eye of the key to I'm Talking to you right now and a key to I'm\nWhite and because of because of security or because you just cheaper\nIt's now it's the security for there's never been hacked blackberry phone okay it's got a nice clear image to it and that keyboard\nFor me is the end all be all I can be under a desk and type people at a note and even

that uh the regular yes regular keep and they're the only ones that's it\nThat's it and I thought you were you know I Love my of my old stuff\nOkay well that's acceptable um the stock market correction you you'd like to see the two percent are going to happen before the end of the year\nI'm hoping that if we do not have too much of a gang busters in profits which means we are seeing softening profits right now in corpus because we had gangbusters last quarter\nI truly believe will be able to see that within the next two or three weeks and then you'll be able to see a nice rise again as people have cashed out completely\nSo I mean when you you saw that Amazon missed and you know we had caterpillar miss and a lot of people or what they're doing in these these future forecasts they're forecasting a democratic takeover the house\nOkay so they're letting people know that the market is going to be solved for them\nSo the forecasting guardian for that and if yes if it doesn't happen if the if the Republicans do keep the house or are you going to reevaluate your two percent yes okay\nI I Will I Will completely re switch that I'll I'll take a look to see what they hold wines ... in the house you know if it's a one seat majority then you know I my job to present to one\nBut a a negative one but you know but if they maintain a decent you know at least ten seats where they can have a couple of defections from their own of votes then I Would say you know definitely I'd say we're at bottom and it's time to really value but we're going to be where we need to get back in and I'm sitting on Seventy five percent cash right now really\nYes Hi liquidated about four and a half days ago uh who are long term goals and a lot of our our shorting is doing very very well you

seven day ... there's a few I mean maybe it's because it's left over from college or\nOr something but I mean are still Fridays are like great that you're probably working on like Saturday college football and noon\nOr we were really was it was happy hour friday night [laughter] and you don't want to know that that's all it was it was all but [laughter] back in the day is what moons farm no no no no where is it was drafted [laughter]\nBut it was oh man I I have a ton of stuff to talk about today and it's interesting because\nIt it always seems like the media goes the wrong way for what I see from the consumer's perspective so when the market was at the low the news media talked about doom and gloom and the economy in in real estate\nWhich you should have been buying when it was at the low when the market was at the high the media is talking about all the money being made in real estate and it's a great time ... they're saying things that the wrong time\nNow I'm seeing the news media talk about rising credit scores and all these new things that are being really\nPotentially put in place in terms of uh benefitting your credit scores but they're not talking about the universal default clause\nThat what that is no but I'm Glad you mentioned it because he's a ...\nA lot of that and and because you didn't know it was even there you wouldn't know ours universal default clause says that Ross let's say you have ten credit cards\nAnd you miss a payment on one that one creditor can report to the credit bureau and tell everybody else that you have credit with right that you're now delinquent right now if you go read the fine print on all of your credit cards in in any of the credit lines you have\nThere's here's your low interest rate but if you miss a payment or you're in default somewhere\nYour interest rate can go to the maximum you surgery they can reduce or close ally that warning on affect them all every last one of them well that's nice or not and now he's not really nice so unfortunately here's what I'm starting to see is\nPeople miss one and creditors are actually getting tighter with what the standards are for credit especially\nHow many times do you see zero percent interest credit cards\nNot not rate lately okay but the offers had been plentiful out there and you know one percent auto loans zero percent but they know the percentage\nOf that they have to offer that's slim because someone's going to make it messed up\nRight and it's all based on your credit scores don't have the right credit score you don't even get in the door but as soon as your credit score goes down or you'd default those credit lines can evaporate making clothing interest rates go up\nI I I got a a credit card from Best Buy because I bought something they said you didn't have zero percent financing for twelve much less ... than I was just it and they and they gave it to me and I had to get a credit card with them which is fine and it gave me like four thousand dollars on the credit card for for you know a thousand dollar purchase and an eight hundred objects is fine\nBut anyway um the address they be able to do was on my address or got sent back so I didn't get a credit card I tried to get on line ... to to take care of it and I couldn't because I didn't have the credit card in my hand and I couldn't even I imagine\nIt went past too so I finally got I'm On the phone 'cause they called me for a pass do notice I got I'm On the phone and they took it off like that just immediately took it off the no problem we understand now so that's great want it didn't affect anything\nOne of the things that you do see is most creditors have in Ninety day window when an account as first established a if something goes wrong in the same thing happens with a mortgage\nIf for whatever reason they mortgage payment the first one there's an issue with the likelihood of getting that fixed is near hunter bread thought I was just persuasive no no I I Know you're a good salesman that right oh man I'm just like everybody else in that one [laughter] go back to the universal ... uh you know had a had a lady who was a past customized Allison that\nYou know amazing credit always has had high seven hundred sometimes touching eight hundred credit\nWell missed a payment on one of her credit cards here's what\nAll of the other credit card started shrinking the credit lines or closing them so we've talked before that if you owe more than half of what the credit line is it's considered negative credit\nWall of a sudden some of our creditors shrank credit limits yeah which also takes points away\nOne of her credit cards closed it because it was one of those zero percent introductory credit card offers so now she has to pay off what's oh but you can't charge anymore that now shows that credit card is maxed out and she's gone from mid to high seven hundreds\nTo middle six hundred they can go that rapidly that fast because that one late payments snowballed everything else I call it the personal\nCredit ... multiple reports not just a single report was single report turned into multiple because of the ramifications\nGood morning Yuma money talk and five sixty KTEL you Derek ... branch manager with academy mortgage dress Clark here with color commentary good morning rest still here you know it is killing the sports you know I'll I'll do the play by play and you do the color commentator you do the hard work uh I don't know about that so\nUm you mentioned something about your your Best Buy account yeah that that was an interesting thing that we need to talk about more\nSo when I set it up it it had the wrong address a best buy which I don't know how it got in there and their pay attention to it and it could've been ... my wife had done years ago but but I never really paid attention\nAnd so when I set up the credit I said yes up everything's fine and they did they said that address off to the the financial institution which is not best by its chase right so chase got it and that's where they got they sent my credit card that's why I never got a credit card and they were statement didn't know what was going on and that's how it ended up being late\nNow let's let's talk about what that means that means that address that you've not use or didn't recognize is on your credit profile with Experian trains union and Equifax probably with chase probably with Best Buy\nSo now at least five major entities think that a jar males so that's an dress could be junk mail\nCould have been your real credit card could be other offers so let's say experience ... union Equifax have this mysterious address on file\nAll of these pre screened offers that you get the mail that says hey apply here for zero percent interest credit cards or here's a brand new discover card here's a brand new visa card\nAll of those potentially could be mailed to that other address and you've never known it because you didn't even know that address existed but that's one of those things that I always say go to the website annual credit report dot com\nAnd that's the one website that you and I legally as a consumer can get all of our information for free every year now they can't legally disclose your credit scores you have to buy those please don't buy 'em don't spend the money to get your credit score from them because it really doesn't matter anyway\nGet the raw data so you're going to get your name's there on file your addresses that are on file your employment that's on file all of the creditors that are on file\nAnd you go back through and corrected Ross I'm telling you right now if I were you I Would go to and your credit report dot com or pay would pull my report and I would look at those addresses and if you've never used that address you go in and you dispute that either on line with the creditor\nFor you write a letter to the creditor that I should say experience ranging Equifax the bureau\nAnd you dispute that I've never used this address please remove it from my file\nWill they they then have to they have thirty days to validate anything you say so like let's say chase reported that address on your file or nobody's ever disputed it if you go dispute that that's a valid address the credit bureau starts a thirty day clock up to thirty days doesn't have to be thirty days\nAnd they will go verify did you ever have credit established at that address did you ever live with that address and if they can't prove it they have to remove the kick it up absolutely they\nCause chase did send two of my credit card there and got to return mail\nAnd have you ever lived there ... there you go so that should be an easy one to pull off of there but you have a male going to that address [noise] kind of like you know let's say somebody ... you know let's say a clerk somewhere giving you credit missed typed your name and spelled it\nAre you you asked\nFor Ross instead of our USS very that typo might actually be on your credit profile somewhere and you know hey I don't spelling\nUs asked you ding dong yeah but unless you go in and look at what data is actually being reported and how is that harmful\nTo me well it it's not other than when you come into a lender like myself\nYou have to sign AKA statements also known as\nAn every name that's on your credit report is a valid name because you've never disputed it so then you're going to say Derrick why am I signing this AK statement that says are you you asked I've never used that name and I have to turn around and say well Russ you legally should be checking your credit profile and what have you done\nSo okay that's one of those things that you have to do\nTake phone call you on the air\n... had a question for your there\nIt's a it's it's kinda funny you're saying you know you never had anybody call in for you saying you never had to lay claim that uh-huh uh it it's\nI mean it's just kind of crazy you're on air saying stuff like that when when you file bankruptcy\n[laughter] will crave the roads are wires fame that well\nWell I didn't file a chapter seven have filed reorganization\nBecause of contractual a with a with genuine parts company and\nI never was laid on anything and in fact everything was paid up to date I never had um a cash flow issue I had a contractual issue with Jane parts companies why filed chapter eleven to get them into federal court so there was never on\nYour last stripped properties to first bank humor\nNo I did not\n\nI mean it's written de lis you're on your language okay I had a problem for health bankruptcy but\nI ... chapter eleven filed chapter eleven which is true and\nI did when that case in chapter eleven which any parts companies saw their mistaken they backed out of it and you can get online take on\nYour on airs things never hunted dead or cause you you file bankruptcy or you crave don't think\nSo so Derrick can explain to the\nWell you keep saying bankruptcy there was a lot of different in the bankruptcy act chapter eleven is reorganization it doesn't mean you're late on anything and I was never made on it ain't it\nMeans you get a little default\nCould do it does not that's not the fault the false chapter seven\nChapter chapter eleven is reorganization and and like Ninety five percent of chapter eleven go into chapter seven which is a default\nYou're right they did in my mind did not it really was it really was an actual chapter eleven that went through as a chapter eleven and it was a reorganization and ah it brought genuine parts company which is a fortune one hundred company into court\nAnd they agreed with not Britain\nFilled up so the properties you own the ... you might have to note on paid off right\nThe properties I owned with first make humor was not in my name was in an L. L. C. and first make you didn't want to negotiate with me so I told him I said look you've defaulted no I did not I said I I like I said I Wonder what\nVery I Wonder what church prayed linger would have to say about that\nAh it's fine to get him on a given mind when I talked to Terry all the time\nI mean you're just crazy wrestling works reality\nI think I just explained the whole situation to you and if you if you find some errors in what I'm saying and then go see something else but if I defaulted on property first make human would sue me so show me the lawsuit you show how corrupt\nI did not there was no where there was a chapter eleven that none of seven if I look I got I got to get this back to Derrick but take a look at what I just told you if I'm wrong on the show me\nHow do your parents tell you if you file bankruptcy they can't shoot your eye\nBankrupt look if I did not I did not default I did not if I if I if I did first bank you would assume that you can have it when I started to\nHang up on on sorry about that I've I don't have any idea who it was a but I still have a credit score in the mid seven fifty eight hundreds um I didn't uh full well here's\nWhat it again what the the caller is talking about is when somebody has a bankruptcy\nI don't know the reasons that you do or don't you know and\nYou're correct there's a chapter seven which is a personal default there's a chapter Thirteen which is a personal reorganization and there's a chapter eleven with which is a business reorganization right example\nThat's what Sears and Roebuck is trying to do right now is I don't I don't they don't have the cash to they they don't have the cash flow and they don't have I I think they have liquidated too many assets\nAre especially since whirlpool is pulled out of of selling through Sears I think we are getting more brand right so I think they're in trouble there\nBut again there's there's people who default their strategic reasons to do it and and I'm not going to make judgment on whether somebody does or doesn't do it in any way and you know and for a long time\nUm and when you look at\nA credit card late which we're talking about that as an actual thirty day late on the credit report and that's what I Want everybody to realize is that one little late payment can sabotage your credit\nFor the next three six nine twelve months right and to the school teacher who teaches at say rancho VA how to the brand new you know firefighter with rural metro that's just starting their career out\nThat one late payment might actually be the the detriment for the next six twelve months that's what I Want everybody to avoid is [noise]\nIt would be much better to rearrange things and make sure that you don't go thirty days late\nYou know I'm not saying go twenty days late and it's as soon as you get you don't go any late but if you have to you know strategically stall this one pay the one that's coming up on thirty days then rearranging and keep doing that until you can take yourself back out of that whole\nYou know have you seen in I saw the progress in cars you and I talk about it but most people most\nPeople who are buying homes really haven't seen that leaf change because they didn't buy two and a half three years ago or they're just coming in now well if you buy a hundred and twenty thousand dollar home which is a conservative home here\nIn interest rates go up one percent that means you're paying an extra twelve hundred dollars a year in interest\nA hundred bucks a month so that leaves falling for that homebuyer if interest rates went up one percent means they're paying a hundred bucks more for that house now is that gonna make or break somebody's budget\nMore than likely not you know you and I spend that much when we go out to dinner or we spend that much when we go I Want to go play around the Gulf and have a couple of drinks or a meal or something\nBut that little bit is getting harder and harder and harder for people to ignore that yeah we did go from the mid threes to now we're over five do\nYou think we're going to touch the sixes by this time next year\nOh highly high probability high probability Fed's already talking about increased interest rate hikes um if you look at what the market is doing when the stock market is at all time highs and we're still talking about earnings coming in for some of these companies that are that are record breaking earnings\nThe stock market going up means interest rates have to go up on the bond side there's just no way around at the fed can't hold the interest rates down certainly on whether it's all the way through they just can't hold the interest rates down that way so to most people who are going to buy a home\nMore than a hundred and twenty thousand dollars you would assume your payment is at least a hundred dollars higher than it would have been last year\nIn interest rates hit sixes it's gonna be another hundred bucks a month higher\nNext year this time so should you go if you don't own a home if you want to buy rental if you know somebody who needs to buy a home who's currently renting should they get out there now and really start kicking the bricks if it makes sense yes there you go so individually\nIs the job stable\nCorrect that's what you need ... is your budget\nSummit why you the wherewithal to make the payment for now clearly if you're juggling and and you have to avoid that thirty days late payment that we're talking about before it may not be the right time to think a bunch of money into buying a home\nBut if you've been making your payments for your rent for the last two or three years and you don't have any issues and you still have money to go out to eat and you still go to Disneyland those would big that's a great time to look at it buying a house\nAnd I guarantee you is is solid of a guarantee as I can give we've gone from the mid threes to now five search Fox News and they'll tell you it's it's over five\nWe just are and that's still a great rate I mean Russia I Know you remember interest rates that had two digits in it you know in the high two digits high two digits yeah do I think we're going to get back to that that rapid inflation model no I don't think so I think the fed has nobody that I hold different weird whole different weird thing\nBut we had a whole different weird thing when the market crashed in the economy crashed and said had to drop the booze we're on the other end it went down to weird low and even\nStill when went home prices in interest rates are at record lows we still had people too scared to buy a house\nBecause they didn't open bottom down I don't know how could but it was about it\nSo now you go well three and a half to five that means interest rates are up nearly fifty percent\nYou know some of the bread and butter homes here in Yuma you could have bought for Seventy Seventy five thousand now they're going for about a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty thousand I can certainly point you to those neighborhoods talk to your real estate agent\nYou know that means those have gone up by fifty percent me it's it's amazing that those two numbers make that house payment significantly higher than it could have been a year and a half two years ago\nA couple of years ago you were in a bigger house for the same whether you're in a smaller\nAnd see you do pay attention rises so it it doesn't stop people from qualifying but what it really does is it makes you qualify or afford something that maybe a smaller home maybe a little bit more conservative and there's nothing wrong with no but\nIn the end every person out there who is comfortably making their rent payment could buy a house\nAnd could buy it before prices keep going up\nOr before interest rates keep going up now\nI didn't say when they could buy a home 'cause I Know you have that inquisitive look look I don't care if it takes a day a week a month a year or working on it we got to work on it and like Alice in with her credit the reason she came in and she wanted to buy another house and turned her old home into a rental and she's got some good plans on on buying\nRental properties well I promise it's gonna be another six months to a year before she can buy that next home because of what happened with her credit but if it takes six months a year in the air is a big scheme of things it's not that much time it really isn't in to a lot of people if you look at the national statistics\nPeople move every five years you know it's not like it's not like your grandparents my grandparents that lived in the same home for forty fifty years in in that was that was that's okay too it it really is\nBut we have become so transient that he really telling me I have a minute left right and I just don't like you and your as we we ... our email it is that you really could buy a home every five years in and build some some real estate for your retirement\nI Would love to talk to anybody about that if you want to know more about buying rentals are investing in real estate\nGive me a call will send them a lot of a cup of coffee or a chocolate chip cookie and we'll talk about it\nBut in the meantime since we have thirty seconds to anybody who has served or is serving and protecting this great country and allowing you and I had to
