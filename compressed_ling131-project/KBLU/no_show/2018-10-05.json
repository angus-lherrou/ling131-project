Know well he's oh I'm Sorry he interviewed the witness that uh\nUm\nHe interviewed the witness and the game of sworn statement as such and the witness was threatened by an email we see emails available\nThe email is like a record it's not just a he said I saw you it's a record if you tell anyone I Will leak it emails signal conversations Gmail senators children's health center for information Social Security's\nSure I mean that pretty much locked it up that it's I'm not a he said she said we just don't jump to conclusions is a Jackson Cosco is innocent until proven guilty when did the Democrats come up with that idea\nAnd it hasn't been one that's access recently none of the last few weeks about innocent until proven guilty\n\nAnd by the way the stuff that Kavanaugh is accused of\nIs still prosecutor in the state of of Maryland the statute of limitations even thirty six years ago has been run out if if they wanted to run down and and have him a prosecuted\nThey could do it today they they could run down in Maryland and say look we're gonna do it right now let's get it done in the answer would be um\nProbably there's no evidence we can't arrest him at least that's what the prosecutor from Arizona said after studying all and that's what she does she's a prosecutor on those kinds of cases\nAnd I think they know there's no evidence or they would have already gone to the to the Maryland attorneys and ... and had that turned over and said prosecute him they would have already done it if it was possible\n'cause 'cause they're not missing a trek in the book there's no trick messed everything's open\nSo we know it's not prosecuted because there's no evidence it's it's a strip strictly a or a memory from thirty six years ago\nThat may or may not be true we don't know I'm not judging that while I'm judging as there is nothing there to prosecute there's no witnesses there's no cooperating evidence and yet there are signs out there if you see some of the size of the protest it makes me ill\nWe believe all survivors all of them so any woman that any woman that comes forward\nAnd says you treated me inappropriately it's an automatic conviction in the in the minds of these protesters right now automatic conviction and that's the way they're treating Kavanaugh and thank goodness\nAnd I say that because he's he's he's been he's shown such great strength he's shown such fearless and and he's he's made the statement I'm not going to quit and he and he's done everything to prove it and he's not going to quit he stood in there\nOr to all of this um this trash has been thrown at him and the disruption to his wife his family attacking his character attacking his is yours is a history of service back to the country\nHe stood up to all of it\nAnd and he's not going to buckle he's not going to back down according to his own testimony and according to the actions that he does for demonstrated\n[noise] so what a what a hero in many people's minds and then a rapist a serial rapist according to many on the left even though\nThere is no there is no cooperative effort in stores there is no there there\nAre any guide there is nobody's turn anything in thirty six years ago nobody said anything nobody said anything nobody said anything now makes up I remember something for thirty six years ago and\nThere's there's no documentation there's no turnover they want the records of capital there's no turning over of of information from a sport Christine force not trained over the polygraph she's not turned over all the notes from a therapist\n\nOr which is of great interest to Grassley and others are because there there are at the point of skepticism because there's no cooperating evidence there at the point of wait a minute there's nothing here ... and and they and they won't turn over the polygraph which was to questions\nOr which maybe that's the way it's done I'm not I'm not a political for but um I've been to them and there was generally doesn't or more questions or they used to be normal for pre employment many places\nI guess I pass 'cause I got the job will be right back five sixty gave

Europe or something\nAnd they'll go from there and ... simply they'll bring those money back to the the Saudi Arabia ... continue to fund their social economic program\nThe fact that there's only so much you can do in the desert ... okay and that gets already did it\n[laughter] yes they did they do it well they still do the uh the oil you mentioned that ... did ... slightly above what you would you would would be God where they came ...\nDid and it it dropped out ... Seventy four thirty right now is so it's just falling down\nAnd we thought it would be God where they came back I did\nAnd it it dropped out at Seventy four thirty right now is so it's just falling down it's still stable\nIt stable as if it's below Seventy five point and one of the items that you saw a a a rocket that came out that most oil dealers were looking at in paying very close attention to what is the I keep keep pulling that came out that showed Republican Senate challenger ... just sitting democratic incumbent\nPulling ahead yes\nAnd most people will say well known that had nothing to do with it and I say yes it does because that means there's a chance that the Republicans could maintain control the Senate and the economic boom that we're experiencing now will not be overturned 'em and even if the house changes side and they impeach\nTrump Senate will still vote snow and things will move forward\nAnd that's what a lot of trade is looking at an oil lives because it all comes down to two plane demand right Democrats in charge you're guaranteed an economic recession they've already promised one doesn't Bill Maher actually came out and said that you know him closely on the show said this is what we need a recession you get rid of the Republican\nYou know and people cheered I didn't understand when people were cheering for their own demise\nThey hate him an added much they hate him that much they will they will lose the family car to to put a Trump out of office I Believe from what I've heard since it's been amazing\nThat's I just I don't understand how you you know vote against their own economic prosperity uh so what do you have to supply and demand on those items people saying okay there's a chance that we'll be able to maintain the economic push forward and all of a sudden now of course you have a lot of traders who said look look the markets crashing this is because people\nSaying you know the Democrats are doing well I'm In Trump is is going to be shown for what he is and then the following a story that came out that the Trump actually lost a billion dollars in value\nAnd company 'cause he's no longer at the helm right\nWhich is why I thought was funny and before that story all the ads that were being run where's that he you know he's enriching himself\n[noise] good point then\nBloomberg came out and said well guess what the president is now a billion dollars less because he's president and he's not overseeing his own empire um so those ads have not come down you know longer really here oh he's enriching himself\nYeah they're moving on to other things yeah ... ... and I do\nHave to say I no longer allowed to run for Supreme Court justice because my wife did informed me that when we were dating I did throw ice okay across the room at my wedding\nWell you damage your reputation more than you thought\nI did so I'm Out of the running on that one\nYeah this will I ever do that to the next Supreme Court pick from Trump should be Hillary Clinton so we can finally during investigation\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat's what I liked that one I think that's the direction we should be going is uh is is is that something could be done or positively I I think I think it would make interesting news anyway [laughter] for sure do I know you don't get you know\nIs that you don't get into the politics much you really don't I mean you you look at the at the\nSort of society and social but Kavanaugh feeling that he's going to get confirmed this weekend\n[noise] [noise] I'm [noise] I'm fifty fifty on I'm assuming Alaska Murkowski will will vote no\n... just to prove that she is independent right oh\nIt looks like Susan Collins is not going to take the million dollar bribe that she was obviously all heard right he said she found the investigation to be thorough which\nYou can take that into a thorough how thorough that it proved that he was innocent or a thorough the you know\nAnd then she found the investigation to be thorough which you can take that into a thorough how thorough that it proved that he was innocent or a thorough the you know prove that the more investigation and yet there's a fifty fifty there\nUm I think if the ... was smart they would one of quick hole in West Virginia or\nGo to a mansion and you're the same thing in Tennessee and slate\nThose if I was McConnell I Would quietly walk into like office and say you know you're most likely going to become a lobbyist after that yeah if you don't want to be frozen out from our side though yeah\nYeah and that may have to stick to that they may have already been done but I don't know yeah it's kinda it's kind of I'm I'm like you I'm I have no idea I I feel like it's going to happen but fifty fifty [noise]\nNow what I'm the only thing that I really get into paying attention to is that I'm concerned\nThat this is not going to be the new norm for all appointee correct on that someone outside of the Supreme Court but presidential employees in general though to oversee the daily operations in the government those who are part of the economic councils or I mean when the employees the Facebook or Google\nAnd a few of the other Snapchat they they made their CEOs quit because on the presidential technology councils that made no sense to me\nBecause if you were truly stinking if you want to inflict pain on a system isn't it better to be able to talk

got plenty of room to slap more on its it's them that doesn't have any room to retaliate because they don't buy that much from us in comparison right there's is limited and and\nSo that game is always always going to be won by us Trump was right about it\nAnd he's been right about\nThe the people coming to an agreement and they have been and\nI'm Talking Canada now in Mexico and much of Europe there's more work to be done but he's winning the whole tariff though he's winning it just like you said he would and China's going to take a while ago to wait until after the election\nBut Trump has a right when he's a negotiating these he knows very well that these other countries are going to take a stand and say no no no so they don't look like they just rolled over but\nEventually they're going to have no choice but to come to the table and a lot for a better deal\nRight now [noise] anyway because she had the gum you take care of had a great weekend\nTo you too bye yeah\nLot's been

away and and being quiet now I guess he's a little Trump be too but he's mocking the SEC is calling that short seller enrichment and commission\nAnd then instead of securities and Exchange Commission short seller because because what he did cause a Tesla is some worries on the market and a lot of people who shorts sold short sell the stock\nSo he's mocking them saying that that's what they what they do or the commission to create short sellers and he considers the is referring to the short sales are jerks who want us to die or by the saga looks healthy\nOh in the future but ill or mosque

I. R. S. I. D. C.\n[noise]\nHey your mother's money talk a timer I share human investment group and my partner at George Davis the mourning\nMourning you every Friday out there before it's nice to have some\nBeautiful Seventy degrees in the mornings isn't it during right yeah are you doing rough doing well how good it was really the whether you're looking forward to getting out of here though oh yeah yeah well they will go stand out in the sun today [laughter]\nCERN color I hear ya so we're going to be talking a little bit about um what's going on the economy\nWhat's going on the markets I'm\nSo naturally you're the date wars bring this up every every show but stock market is still moving ahead a year to date the dials up nine point five percent which is a respectable number the NASDAQ which are pretty much the tech companies in this in a smaller companies are up fourteen and they have some peas up about ten\nSurf the your ended today I mean those numbers would be pretty good I think especially since the market really they may start making money and tell a spiked in um in January and then it then it went down there really wasn't much money made until the middle of August\nSo for them for a long time it was relatively flat down mhm so now we're back up back up top whatever ghetto bowl a couple of ten percent\nDownturns one in January when in March\nAnd people see the market you know on each day time and and it seems like it'll hit they'll say oh hitting a new high again are getting real close but I'm just shows kind of how things have been bouncing around just the last three weeks I'm yesterday's pulled back was actually a three week low\n... at a just a day before was getting a new high or something so\nYeah one of the things we're seeing in our meetings ... clients is now hearing on the media the news radio that were hit new eyes which we\nWe kind of hard in the last ... so that kind of think of the numbers are going to be pretty heavy because you know new highs is pretty heavy but because January it was such a strong month and then it went down from there and then I kind of started going back to the\nTo the uh positive again in the middle of August\nI'm you know the numbers are are are strong but they're not like off the charts strong and they brought on my last year how their expectations are that you know and we should be making a lot of money\nWhatever you do want to talk about is the er the bond market because the fed is raise rates are three times this year and last week was another time and if you go down the bonds that across the board negative for the year\nI'm about two and a half or government bonds are down there about\nTwo point three long term good bonds or donate I'm Wondering through your bonds are down to a pretty much across the board even the corporate bonds are down a little bit they want\nThat's a bond sector that's up as a high yield bond as a to point two percent\nBut I'm not old additive when interest rates go up the price of bonds go down and and that's a true relationship um and that's happening and you know people that are in bonds are wondering whether or not you know making much money 'cause of markets that new eyes but they don't understand that the cost of interest rate risk\nSo explain that inverse relationship talk because people don't really quite understand that\nSo that's just give a hypothetical and let's just say you get a five year bond that hypothetical five percent return or that's the the yield in return for your so let's just say six months into this holding this five year bond rates go up to a\nSix percent or so bases six months into this and if you go to replace your bond\nNo one's going to want to pay for a five percent bond because the markets bearing a six percent bond\nSo they end up discounting your price of the price goes down so that basically your yield will go back up to six percent and then it prices on the market and so what people don't realize is if you hold Tim maturity you have nothing to worry about\nYou know this is a Tom rushed with human vessel group we're got money jog your got a part of the George Davis in West parking here as always um we're talking about are the markets and the international markets um are down this year just because of the trade ... um\nBut yeah I'm the emerging market in particular looked like about ten percent down\nNot emerging markets are smaller ... countries so then\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter] yeah okay now you got that ... I think for the call\nSo [noise] yeah they can just maybe drop take a couple of planes and drop billions of dollars on the um on the airport and just leave it there [laughter] so that ship it over ... like they did in Iran and you know when when seven billion or something or and that's a good payday\nSo but you know if I'm somebody you know you read different economists have different views but there's a big handful out there are pretty smart people the economists that they don't care about the trade deficit\nUm they think that there's a strong point if like you were willing to lend me money in and negotiate a trade I mean don't get me wrong and the big picture but they didn't get to a method of strength from my part\nLike we're going to extend what I'm doing you know I'm at I'm In a stronger position even though I have a deficit to you\nRight because we get cheaper goods or something like that because uh they can produce a cheaper than us\nBut I think it gets a worrisome and Trump has pointed out that when they low ball manufacturing steel and aluminum just to shut our plants down once plants were shut down they can raise prices back\nYou know having unfair competition and that's one to watch out for them and the bigger picture of putting us out of the business that's where we are not manufacturing\nAnd some of the some of the industries in China you with the U.S just has access to none of it ... they just can't get in period correct and for the longest time I believe it was cars but that they've kind of let that go but yeah ... years ago like no car maker can even touched China but none of the terrorists are so high\nJust like in Europe um Germany has a ten percent tariffs on us we have a two point five percent tariff on them\nOn a car so it's easier for us to import a BMW for them than for them to board a Chevy yeah which is unfortunate and that's what this whole tariff is I mean there's ... like leveling the playing field in fact Trump even asked to do away with all of them make it all zero nobody wants to do it\n... no one wants to make it all zero and who wants to make it all zero you need when they were not many people thought about it\n[laughter] nobody well because we're at the disadvantage almost every turf deal out they're worth of discipline\nYeah now but I Will tell you if one company country stepped up there probably will get a lot of business from the U.S right probably take a phone call you're on the air\nAbout a ... right yeah yeah I Know on our long ah is that right or\nIs they have a a you know a lending right\nSo you know I'm not an expert in that area but I Know that buying our our our treasury bonds you know short term long term me in the immediate term\nSo if industry and start to go up you know they're going to continue to you know by those in the public and I have a higher rate so the answer is yeah it's not a locked in rate it is flexible but it's um it it's based on them buying bonds and if interest rates go up upon rates are going to go up and then they're going to buy so\nSome of that might be verbal I don't know the banking side of it\nBut yeah but they don't really control it and China they don't just say I want it to be this and change it\nYeah I\nDon't I'm not buying are are are basically treasury bills and notes and all that\nOkay good question though\nI was thinking I mean who you know who gets up that doesn't even realize I early in the morning to you know [laughter] I don't think it [laughter]\nYeah a couple of phone calls our number here three or four four or five to five eight every question force or for the next break Tom I wanted to ask a couple\nOn that we didn't get to finish up on it without rising interest rate environment or one of the strategies for you know 'cause people rely on the bonds for fixed income\nTo rise in interest rate um get short in the long into the yield curve and or shorten the overall duration in any bond ladders\n[noise] yeah so if you should be showing the duration and bonds and means if interest rates go up the price on drop as much\nUm if you have a long term bomb like a thirty year bond um you know if interest rates go up it would drop quite a bit more I remember when I got in the business at a dean Witter are probably over twenty twenty twenty five years ago\nOne of the what are the older retirees came in and want to buy a thirty year treasury bill\nSo um you know I was in the business for maybe less than a year anyways we bought it and I think it was a Ninety six Ninety seven when the economy kind of felt a little bit and I was in like six to nine months he was down like twenty two percent on it\nAnd the fed raises rates you know quite quickly in\nReally quick you I mean I realize that it you know\nThere is interest rate raskin and less yield the maturity you can face that but yeah bonds bonds can get beat up to ... showing the duration so that when rates go up they don't drop as much\nAlso by showing the duration of means at bonds are coming due and the portfolio so when moms come do than they have to take the cash and buy new bond served as interest rates are going up the new bonds are buying have higher yields right so that's another benefit of our window duration\nAnd that has to do with the ladder and right and so if you're short do ladders that shorter generations when that comes do you can see what rates are and you could maybe\nGet a better rate and the flip side of that if if interest rates are ... you're going to go down for a while then you want to extend your duration lock in those high ... high a yield so that you know you you don't they don't we knew again and then you have a short one you know where to take a another break your this is talk five six yeah [noise]\nIt's going to hurt the person given it yeah basically not at all in a ... for except in so you can imagine if you're getting alimony\nAnd you're paying taxes on a twenty percent or whatever and all of a sudden I get it with tax free that was like a rough IRA and wants to run out and get a divorce\nI Need all of them I Know that's a good deal [laughter] maybe that will lower the factory for Fifteen or the divorce rate for fifty two percent maybe people\nDon't get to the war so I get a little confused on this uh itemize though because it's so high now and um\nThis article saying time is maybe what they call it ... you mentioned that where you're making charitable donations instead of just a one to two in one year\nYeah yet up to that threat let's say you say to get the direction you're going to put it in a thousand dollars for a chair with an auction on on a number but if you're going to do less than a thousand you and get the direction so don't do one one year and then the following year two thousand and that might put you over the limit way you know that we get the new ... okay so that's what that means\nThat might be good for charities and some people are real close or you know John both in one year\nBut the good thing about this tax change thing is if you have kids you're definitely in a better position like they were very friendly on what can be deducted for the for the kids for having ... you know the kids are in your household\nSo that's good I mean I Know I'm like even if you make pretty good money with you know for kids and you know soccer and all the other stuff that you have to kind of pay for and different different uh ... you know music classes and things that they're given a break for that so that that's good\nAlso on the five twenty nine plan which is a college plan that you can set up for your kids are they made some exceptions to that the old days or you put money into an account is not not deductible everybody wants a college plan to get to the ... something and you can't\nBut then it grows deferred and then you used to be able to touch it for anything above high school so it could be attached to be used for college but they've actually change the law now that you can touch ten thousand a year for elementary school or a high school so basically the five twenty ninth can now be used before college\nWhich means people can plan ahead if they think they're going to send their kid to a private school or high school they can plan for that\nAnd that's a big deal again because this is apathetic ally you got to seven percent return a doubles in ten years so we have a newborn doubles in ten years whatever money put in there there's no tax on any of that if you spend it for you know school or college or anything above that\nYep and otherwise kids the other uh [noise] ... is a huge deal but uh the\nEstate and gift tax exemptions went from five point six million to eleven point two million for each individual estate tax exemption and then a twenty twenty two point four million for married couples\nSo with that uh\nIncrease they're saying that approximately point zero eight percent less than one percent of the states will oh federal income tax now\nNow I think a\nPresident who the president would benefit from the life out let's say but it it it is sunset I think in two thousand twenty five and goes back then you you did you know that no I did not know yeah it's a sunset provision always just for so yeah it's ... percent period of time on who knows\nWhat will happen after that yeah um\nAnd you know if I'm going to be frugal or and saved my money or or be smart and that's my money and real estate or stocks or something you know why would my my kids are river I leave it to my grandkids why would they be why should they be you know a\nTax on that right I mean well if I Try to act on it is a temper I spend every dime and just live loosely and I don't have nothing you then you know that doesn't affect so it is kind of a rule that that isn't um maybe as fair for people that\nEither a smarter war Carter plan ahead so\nYeah you're right it should\nKnow the the thing that uh is interesting and it's kind of gone away you haven't heard much in the news or that\nBut a beginning a year and they're all talking about\nA spending a trillion dollars on the infrastructure and the Republicans and the Democrats roll on board and everybody you know said yeah we'll for it and that's really gone away I mean that that's going to come up recently\nAnd I think what's happening is now fighting so so much on these smaller issues are not a small issues but like with the Supreme Court and um and trying to get judges and that in the end of their positions that\nI'm the kind of got distracted from the big picture will be interesting to see if that happens but that does happen\nWe know infrastructure the United states a lot of it needs to get replaced so could be a good thing I Know Trump wants to use about Seventy percent of the outsourced it to private companies sure and and I know the Democrats want to\nTry to spend most of it and turn away so I Know that's kind of done a seeing eye there um but the interesting if that comes in eventually that could be another big shot in the arm to keep this economy going keep stretching out you know how long it's going to go\nUm yeah if we use it properly it was a\nWoman had to shovel ready jobs and all that but there never were any shovel ready jobs I mean for infrastructure never did it yeah uh so it was really no Managua shot in the arm because we never really\nGot the money was was done so we're taking a break here this is money talks five six am\n[noise]\nSports as humans hunting is shooting borders and the home of humans indoor shooting
