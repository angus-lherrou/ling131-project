protect the border because now you're a racist wanted the lawyer racist\n\nAnd yet it was it was a was a Democrat platform until recently but all of a sudden it's not it's not it's tear down the walls

air\nWell good morning how are you today I'm doing well good morning we had a little discussion yesterday about\nOur president I was wondering if you\nGot a hold of your attorney friend in Washington\nNope haven't been able to talk to him tried yesterday with with a\nLittle research on this and um\nI just make a little ... a little quotes here and then um the uh the exclusion of aliens is a fundamental actors sovereignty inherit an inherited in the executive power that's what the Supreme Court that back in Nineteen fifty\nAnd if you have any doubt Congress adopted a provision in Nineteen fifty to feign the president and I'll quote me by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend\nThe entry of all aliens and any class an alien as immigrants or non immigrants whenever he thinks\nIt would be detrimental to the interest of the United states\nAgreed I think everybody I think everybody will not everyone's going to do that but\nBut I agree but we don't need to make a lot and do we he's got the power to do yes we do yes we do what I Need to make a law\nBecause he he has the power to say no they don't have to go to a judge he can't he can't he can't just change the way we we process but\nRemember we talked about a moratorium on not anybody come on anybody can then yes you know and again and then we talk about and I know I Know\nI'm gonna let me tell you that more will absolutely work absolutely work on the people that applied legally\nAbsolutely it'll work and it'll work on the ones that are invading us no they won't because when they when they invade in there and they have to see a judge and that's a two year backlog\nBut the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor and they invaded or can we make them see a judge\nYou know when there was a war we did we remember and German Chancellor seated\nDetermine ... attorney for civil since it was it was a black mark on our on our history not\nJust this is illegal whether they're legal or not legal you know I mean there's a process they have to go to ... come into this country yeah seven here illegally look at the amount of foreign aid ...\nProcess to get money out of a bank to but you can go in with a gun and bypass it I'm not in it and it's illegal but at the same as the process coming in this country there's a process where you can bypass it and that's what's going on is the bypass it not not\nAnd it's illegal but the same as the process coming in this country there's a process where you can bypass and that's what's going on is the bypassing not not a\nNot coming to looms so you're just going to go ahead and let them come in here and then sit back and cry and say look what the Democrats are doing\nNope nope we need invaded you know we're going to be here whether it's by land air or sea is an invasion process All right what it is is that not what it is yes it is and can we agree okay it is so we agree we agree that we have the right to protect our border yes okay so where is the problem\nBecause the ... the laws in the last good laws won't support would you recommend\nOkay they're breaking the law coming into the country legally that doesn't mean they're ... they're\nSeeking political asylum and have another process yeah because I doubt that not one of them person people coming across the border has been invaded has stopped in Mexico and applied for a political asylum\nNope they don't like it almost as bad I mean maybe some maybe the Democrats are given political asylum in Mexico I don't know because that's all we're turning this thing into a political thing\nOf course it's not a political thing it's an American problem not a Democrat problem not a Republican problem will say Mardi or libertarian than getting darn American problem\nYes it is get the legislator together to do to fix the we had to kill as long as\nThey're all campaigning to\nTo get their pockets filled with the goal ... maybe you can't get a senator together\nWe've got a vice president coming down here\nTo to rally for somebody instead of concern about what what's going on\n[laughter] you know those ads that doesn't mean he's not concerned about what's going on it's ridiculous\nThat's not what he's now but can we can only do one thing that ridiculous it might be just as ridiculous as having a big\nOld Hawaiian Lou I'll well someone or\nCountries or are they being plummeted by a typhoon what's the difference I mean come on this is a this is a ... a a very very important issue that's happening\nOf course it's a real issue and that's why there's been so much time on it that doesn't mean they stop eating lunch there still are still other other things they do\nYou know like your gentleman to color or a wreck or a present of go heart goes or um those are\nCats I sound like a very nice to diligent person there and these are pretty uh pretty\nTruthful when he tells us that the problems that both sides the out don't trust their leaders\nOf course of course he's truth isn't that sad\nI think we want to get through stuff right now I mean come on I think it was on fire already our priorities in America right now are upside\nDown and he's talking the leadership within Congress and Senate and stuff like that when they exactly twice that things doggie others\nYou know there's some feelings of joy because\nWell I think are I think our priorities and the U.S today right now or just a little upside down a well and I guess we'll just let them come across and then we'll talk about I guess it's good because it'll it'll keep it'll keep radio talk show host like\nYou know it's not it's not good for that reason it's good for this going to see it it's good to possibly it will get our legislators into action when people say enough when people like you like me and everyone else say enough with the addiction\nWhat they're saying it's enough for how many years\nWell obviously they haven't heard of yet so how do they know\nThey're not just recently invaders here not too long ago yeah we separated the children\nAnd all that and and I guess we're still talking about it but I guess politicians that's what it is that they open their lips and they talk about it\nWell you know you can you can you can be jaded like that and just give up on it I'm not going to I'm going to tell you I I tell you there's good people there and we just haven't reached him yet

I mean we governance use\nYou said that the best person on the state's economic development team is Governor Brown\n[laughter] that was hilarious Governor Brown didn't like it but it was hilarious over the moon\nBeing you just got a little bit but what do you know I think some of those things that changed the constitution I mean this is\nIn the to protect our our taxpayers' one twenty six I mean they're they're advertising has been very very effective or one twenty six or in essence says that the legislature kid can not enact any tax on any service\nThat isn't already in place as a writer semper two thousand Seventy in originally when I just when they just did the headlines okay I said yes I when I I I Want to anti tax all the way right\nRight right and because if you extend this conversation farther that I Would is at some point in time have to charge a sales tax for the service of becoming a member of the chamber of commerce in Africa ... tax collector for the state so I'm going yeah yeah but they weren't right into it\nThis is the lawyers dream well it's picking winners and losers too which I'm against [noise] ah doing that I personally I'm voting no one one twenty semi new that why\nYou want to change the constitution and changing the constitution is risky business but the lawyers are saying please pass the ... we get to sue everybody because no one's define the term service yet [noise]\nOh really oh maybe we can get rid of the sales tax and everything else that would that would that would be fantastic the I'm going to vote yes on let's see there's yeah ... ... for the very reason that it would limit the power the government to attack the\nDebt and what we ought to do is limited [laughter] go even further shirt it only limited on certain things doesn't limited overall no I mean if the government wants to raise a billion dollars they'll still do it they just do it on some item that picking winners and losers but it's still\nIt's still at least limits the government to tax ... well on ... over dollars with they'll get your wall if it limits\nLimits the limits the government to tax let's say a air conditioning guy comes to my house okay the sort of service if he has to buy free on there was a sales tax on it free on his insurance me but his service okay\nDoesn't get tax that's the way it is now correct yeah correct yeah and so why should we tax but see here's the IRS here's the problem we're creating an issue that doesn't exist known as ever thought of taxing services and so this came up\nWell the the issue came before the legislature where somebody proposed an idea why would you tax everything flat and stop doing winners and losers and that's why this ... so that's how the secret service cinder ceases as we don't want to be part of that they you know we like our exemption\nRight and then the human association militarily\nWe ought to exempt everybody now Howard got it right the libertarian is I give him in here we go [laughter] hell is less\nGovernment operation okay we're not too excited about tax no okay so I I've always wondered why people who\nAre\nSo I've I've always wondered why people who are\nNot exempt from Texas want the exam people tax why aren't they arguing hey exempt us too yes\nBut you never get that but you never get there early on nuclear always they always want hey charge them too but we've we've ... we've accepted them as a\nReality that libertarians not the libertarian that's right so you didn't write the ... the sixteenth amendment right okay we would've never\n[laughter] never really I never even dreamt [laughter]\nJacob thanks very oh yeah oh yeah a power to do that well interestingly enough I ... I was um after years in a town hall on financing years on the future and it was all about revenue for the state and we did we did this for three days in the documents in my office\nAnd one of the things we came up with is the fact of the state of Arizona is way too way too\nDependent on sales tax\nAnd we have one of the lowest property taxes you in in the nation so we used to okay so the answer is a property tax evidence they go to lunch or so so so I'm thinking can we talk about some cost restraints can we talk about maybe you'll balancing your budget which they of course they do and they have a new uh but\nPropositions and then one of the things too because we're kind of bouncing around\nIt's a myth and never we set the timer [laughter] but um\nYeah we get more propositions and then one of the things too 'cause we're kind of bouncing around the crane elementary school uh override but that's going to be on the ballot for those in the Korean school district and it's going to cost me in my home um isn't it cost me about Seventy bucks a year for this deal the issue with the override\nUm since we moved here in January third of two thousand\nUm we have always voted for education Yuma county is ... is generous to education you almost to a fault we always pass overrides well was passed bonds\nThis one is a direct result of again the legislature uh not funding correctly the legislature moving money around so they're they're short in the money that they want this war is basically for security and for safety you know I'm In this one the again and again just in the Korean school district again I\nYou got to pay for stuff and I understand the libertarian approach I rarely do Howard but some things just got like a pay for in today's world or in education safety and security is almost as important or ask some foreign airs reading writing arithmetic in today's world unfortunate but that's kinda where we are\nWell no no there's no question that you have to provide safety and you have to provide an education um I guess the real issue here is\nThe the override is a result of the fact that the state keeps stealing\nMoney from the local district yup now if that didn't happen if that didn't take place than the overall I Would be necessary correct\nAnd so how do we get our state legislature to stop taking\nOur money [laughter] I I think part of it is that the ballot box [noise] um and and making sure that we send folks to Phoenix that the understand you know the financial realities of today\nAre you and I've gone to the capital of ... it is fascinating and educational but also understanding that when they go to balance that 'cause they must balance the budget K they have to balance the budget and again the\nThe big goof is they don't seem to cut expenses they always want to re either raise the taxes or do this lake school district\nMoney take road money from the county's take money from the cities and they don't talk about reducing expenditures okay\nOr why is that most of the fiscal restraint because because that's what they do sing exposures ... ... well yeah exactly but it's also having the courage to make some tough decisions we can't afford this this week long this this is this is a a a wanting to need\nSo yeah they just don't have the courage to decide one from the other that to me is is a scary part a again in\nThe middle of the people need to send than their representative elect people do that body that would have the courage to do something to be able to sit down and look at some say hey you know what this is going to be nice this would be very nice but you don't want to know something we can't afford it I suspect you and I and everybody else does the same thing with their own personal budget\nAnd yet there's a lot of things that I Want to have a lot of things I Want to go they can that makes a limited resources unlimited on one\nLeaking almost went on a again another shout out to Arizona town hall we spent three days on funding of education you know K. through twelve and the whole three days was I heard was more money more money more money more money more money more money and no one said maybe we\nWell and the whole three days was I heard was more money more money more money more money more money more money\nAnd no one wants to maybe we ought to look at the process by which we get the money\nHow much can we use technology to quip there were done we have nine school districts near the county no one's talking about how we do the smarter sharper better faster and save money um the process right now you have a Nineteen fifties system of obtaining money\nIn the twenties out in the twenty twenty problem and no one wants to really upgrade how bad happens I'm\nBob Cleo ... I was in the ... school district by ... ... want to see the wall to wall binders of the people work that's reports ... paper yes that's got to be pushed to get the cash\nAnd they require paper this morning we're bracing commission ... and and I\nI to Bob or should I Will submit half of these forms are done wrong half or anyone looked at you goes a marketing mhm so I I think if someone's going to stop the train tracks and say let's maybe do the smarter better how can we cut costs by improving the processes\nAnd and you know maybe maybe a discussion needs to be made and how we actually financed schools to begin okay yeah what about looking at possible thinking about the free market a market free of government intervention free of government control now\nI Want to be I think that will take our total guys were just let them at risk factors that go an average out to actually carry out of their break or the other month later I had to learn\nAnd Andy and\n[noise]\n\n[noise] the the\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\nBoom boom boom boom doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThe the the the\n[noise] Mm\n[noise]\n\nWe're ... ... studio Howard blanche I hate that word member a state cheer a little bit of the Libertarian Party\nHe's a real problem I'm Sorry no he he really really really I've always wondered how the legislatures going to operate when we finally elect a libertarian in there\nIt's really going to screw up the way it gives us I'll slowly predicated on two parties is at that point I'll tune in and watch [laughter] man you see a lot a lot of discussion going [laughter]\nI'm In ... Howard also runs a freedom ... great discussion this morning\nA we're talking education we will it we're not going to get through all the proposition but again a for what it's worth I Am voting for the over right for grain um they they have to do something and there's ... and I know ... some of those folks are needed to do this you know the ... and they worked\nMorning noon and night to figure out how much are we short what do we need um got to keep kids safe at the other day you got to keep kids safe I think that that's pretty important um\nThe the one on um\nProperty or five ... bans school choice and the voucher system\nUm and when I when I read the book or the voter devoted guide unfortunately that's really um the the the left and the right I don't understand why that is a property or fire it experienced school choice right is what it does\nIt allows parents to have more choice whether their kids get to get educated and I think that's a good thing for ... choice guy ... so I'm I'm saying yes and there's some folks they know we were more control and I'm thinking why are we even having this", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "24"}
