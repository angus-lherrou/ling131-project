Melvin rally against recall her stupid and a comment stupid and sensible\nMaggie Megan apologize on a sheet\nText it out or sent an email I Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry the country feel so divided and I have no wish to add to the pain and off and I\nBelieve this is time for more understanding more love more since a sensitivity and order thank you for listening and for helping me listen to\nNow you know and it was a conversation that question on whether it was was acceptable was and I bet it was taken his races or you know blackface or and it was a sensitivity to some people are which is what's the discussion was about was it was about the discussion insensitivity ah she was dropped by her talent agency creative artist\nAgency a she was fired of course we're a big talks about it the ...\nWhich which I like he says apologies aren't good enough anymore when the throes of cultural lawlessness execution on demand and contacts are common sense don't matter execute them hang them get rid of them yes what's happening next\nShe was drop are talented agent she's a pariah now and uh he points out that it's a it is\nAnd you and you've got to be really careful on what culturally acceptable what's not culturally acceptable what you can get a immediately condemned for and what you will\nBe and it's it's just gotten to be the point of ridiculous news and it's getting worse it's going to get worse I'm not defending making Kelly or what she said but I I don't\nI I think she was asking legitimate questions and at one time you know people dressed as any kind of character whether it was a historical Indians or or civil war\nUm you know from the salary within or no that's not acceptable I'm I got ya I'm a good morning how are you\nPretty good how are you doing too well buddy a a a haven't mentioned a vice president and yes and\nNo habits there no tell me you were I was not there but tell me about\nIt you weren't no you are with your granddaughter\nI was with us today I was with the terrorist yeah I was with the terrorists for three days the thirty injure\nShe's very very brave [laughter]\nI'm trying buddy but man she's fast to got to keep up with her and I know I saw you at the moment the motorcycle saying they're showing shine on a Saturday\nRight she's a good in that way again by the way it's a limo with the wagon level it oh you mean by any way you look like a proud grandpa I'm having a lot of fun a lot of them\nBack back to friday I ah was honored to be on the VIP table checking the man good\nBut it was great at people who are really really good I mean 'cause a wait in line for for your named it'd be found and and and the ... be put on and\nAh I had three different copies [laughter] the original the second original and the third original no but but it it was fun and people\nWere often inside talk about energy it was great Mike Pence will be our next president after Donald Trump does is or\nYou think so I mean and that's a tough transition a vice president to president I mean it happens\nBut Lyndon Johnson did it well you can do and that was a little different than how often\nBut I I understand that and didn't forward do it all so\nYeah that was will never do that was a ... resignation but yeah we don't we don't want to yeah\n[laughter] but uh uh guys powerful very powerful I didn't get to shake his hand but fact that I saw a vice president with colds and me I I enjoy the heck out of it\nSo I I Know I Know it was that the Joe Foss hanger and ah I Know is limited number of of tickets available because just the size but um it was how many people were there do you think\nI heard Seventeen Seventeen hundred oh Seventeen hundred okay this is science center in Seventeen would be like Hillary Clinton meeting\nAnd that's a good place to my understand going to be our next major employer a space program or something to that effect\nThat's the right thing to do is to take take the kids and get them get them in at least aware you know you may not get them away from the video games and some of the other social interest they have a ... been awareness is is always good more education we give them that and let them know that we make a difference devoting makes a difference and\nAnd people getting engaged makes makes a big difference take another phone call you're on the air\nA rough yesterday morning\nI'm here to talk about the Megan Kelly thing [noise] okay I think that was absolutely ridiculous what they did to her yeah\nOh she says she couldn't see any reason why maybe a white kid or somebody else would want to dress up like Diana Ross if that kid admired that person that much and that was no slur from that or I see nothing wrong with it I give you an example [noise]\nWay back when when my son was in a OC Johnson and grade school the teacher had a thing one day that every kid had to come in not everyone whoever dress like a historical figure\nRight you know\nOne kid came in and and he wasn't a black kid he came and dressed up like Martin Luther king and other girl came in dress like ...\nYou know the ... and uh\nAnd they had like a little judging contest and things like that\nMy son what like Neil Armstrong when he was standing in the ... on the moon and the space to my memory making the space suit and\nWhole nine yards but then to go back further Nineteen Seventy seven when ... not too many people ever heard of this man before a guy named Bob Marley you know the reggae king\nAnd I got into this and then they have a long time anybody ever heard of them we had a Halloween party and I was dressed like ... or Bob Marley even made the weight with dreadlocks\nIn the whole nine yards used to be not being offensive\nWay because I admired the guy and if we're going to real we've gotten so ridiculous than some of these things as long as you're not making fun of the person you know I've seen the heck have I have no womb mentioned Bill Cosby member of the Gerald Gerald ... excuse me the jello commercials when he was dressed like the godfather\nJello commercial\nThat's like the godfather yeah ... ... ... and that was\nJust a conversation is used as acceptable as a ride and all that there's been so much um\nYou know so much political correctness and in about sensitivities to ... you know you know racism that stuff that we're going down a little hyper comes down to it\nDoes that mean only black people should listen to Motown only white people should listen to the beach\nAnd I don't I don't think anyone suggesting all that but no I Know\nI Know they're not but I mean things are supposed to talk to take a look at the late great Jimi Hendrix to bridge the gap between boat you know\nAnd uh went on to probably be one of the most famous or even with that guitar player that ever lived in in some people's opinion you know\nYeah and I just think it's absolutely ridiculous to be to look at it and Kelly especially when you've got people like joined by car than there were some correspondent for the NBC were slamming down on white people old\nMan [laughter] you know there's there's no there's no consistency to to the uh tolerant crowd\nI Know I don't know they're absolutely not\nI Know they just see it one way and that's all there is to it but I like I said I'll get off I don't I don't see any reason I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the fire mayor Megan Kelly\nI die I appreciate school thanks I'm like man I I think\nIt was more than just that one thing but I think you know the the movie Tropic Thunder is the last one I can think of where like Robert Downey junior did the whole the whole movie and boxing he played a black character\nUm which never never got a problem with that but but uh I guess there's insensitivity depending on how it's handled so its dangers I Would not do it no I'd stay away\nBut\nJust the Megan Kelly thing I think because she had so many other problems too and it probably was one that was enough that I was reading this yeah this isn't on\nFox News about Amazon Prime Amazon Prime everyone's familiar with and and the the company Amazon and what they do in most everybody's doing it but apparently there's

at\nAt that things kids were doing wrong and you didn't ever even look at the things that they're doing right you just held him accountable for doing wrong\nAnd it was it like a scared straight thing where you know remember they used to scare the kids scream at them\nOh yeah I was a popular show I guess for a while but I you know it really was\nAh scared straight in fact a there was a time we took a group of juveniles up to a a to Florence to the prison and well I I think the uh the probation officers that when we're more intimidated then the kids [laughter] when you had some of the\nKids they would wave I uncle Louis how you doing oh no oh good to see you know they'd be\nGone for a family visit ... so scared ... straight was something that was popular but it really wasn't if it didn't work now no it didn't\nYeah ... that's when I first saw like that's horrible and I know people were looking at it like it was a you know you got to be those kids into submission ... or you don't you know and that's not your program\nNo no and you know as we thought we knew everything a cutting edge a for as long as I've been in the juvenile Justice Center which is twenty seven years [laughter] and it it took all the way till twenty Thirteen to learn something about\nShow coming up so I'm getting involved pretty happy with that so\nAnd and we want to talk about the show it's like you've got ... ... a big mountain really knew they are\nI I'm sure you do you've heard that you've heard the song\nWhere everybody's heard the song they play it on the uh sister station over there hunter point nine what's on\nIt said ... baby I love your ways okay yeah so it's a remake of it yeah the remake of it yeah yeah big mountain big room but um it's a it's a great story how big mountain got got involved with the kids are hoping it'll it'll tell us what would I let him tell tell us similar law to make it big mountain I didn't\nWell it's it's it's quite a unique story um\nAs you know for probably the last year year and a half there's been something that's what's been going around on social media called the law enforcement lip sync challenge yeah and it's funny and it it's it's hilarious to on there's a there's departments that do it very simple with a maybe a a\nA a iPhone are and just shown themselves lip sync in a song and then there's some very elaborate well uh in July\nWe were challenged to do lip sync challenged by another county probation department Cook County and they just uh had done a a a lip sync challenge and it was a pretty good catchy song and\nUh I like to accept challenges so I sent a a email out to one of my supervisors and asked him if he would be interested in in answering this challenge um it's kind of funny because I had sent an email to him about eight o'clock in the morning after I had read the email from a Cook County\nAnd or ask them to help\nI didn't hear anything about four thirty in the afternoon and I'm thinking well either he's ignoring my email because he doesn't want to do it or not there who would blame him well out of hand and he comes running in my office about ten till five and he goes to ... he goes I have a great idea\nIt's it's has hope in it and I will tell me about it\nBut he basically explained that many movies that he wanted her to me and the only thing is we only had a week to do it because we wanted to show it at our employee appreciation week right oh he just started working on it I didn't know what was going on a and I had a small bit piece in it and\nUm that friday we showed it to our our staff and an employee lunch in and everybody loved it and and we used a song called lean on me I remember lean on me as a song by bill withers many many years ago in the seventies but this had a more much more catchy version it was by a band called big mountain who I hadn't heard of\nAnd they do a pop reggae type of music\nBut most of my staff who are much younger than I Am at at the department or they they thought big mountain had made that song oh you know uh we get excited and decide do posted on our Facebook page on what their kids at home page\nAnd lo and behold probably an hour after I posted I get this message from Facebook that says the gap there mute the music because I don't have the rights to it\nWell I was new at this and and didn't said okay it's kind of scary and then they said here's ways that you can get a a permission one of them was to get permission directly from the band\nWell I took a chance I reached out on social media center a a a message out and the next morning I get a a\nInformation back ... and an email and they said uh you know you have we we forgive you for using it without her permission but we've seen the video we love it and you have her permission to continue playing and I thought that was good yeah do I accomplish what I wanted to do\nAnd that man asked me if\nI Would be interested in doing something further and he he wanted to talk about what his philosophy was with kids\nAnd it it right away it reminded me of what we do with kids and have that same philosophy that kids that everybody there is hope\nAnd so that went back and forth in about forty miles later he says the bands on world tour right now they come back to the end of September we have some time you know a couple of dates in October November how would you like us to do a benefit concert\nI that was completely taken aback um and so I said well let me talk to our committee because that was only a few months from the end of July till November to get something done\nAnd and you know we do things bad so I I went to the city of humor and I ask 'em view have or anyplace available on November eleventh\nWhich happens to be official veterans' day okay and uh they they said yeah we do and so we have the best venue in town and we have a concert coming up on November eleventh\nAnd starring big mountain and it's going to be a desert sun stadium which\nWhich shouldn't be a big draw big big mountain as like you say they're playing on stations all over the country\nIt they they're yeah they're very popular I did a lot of research in into big mountain because I hadn't heard of him\nI saw that a ... their biggest song that they had in the early to mid nineties was a song called maybe I'll every way which was and is a a rebound cover song a remake uh but it was much much more catchy than the original and then uh\nUh they have lots of other songs and they're really good and and I've got to talk to these folks over the phone and email several times have that belief um so\nBut they want to help out yeah so this this uh a concert on the eleventh is uh twenty dollars admission for adults Fifteen for law enforcement military and first responders and children six Seventeen kids under six free and bring the terrorist my one year old when you're old\nGrey eye where where are some more uh forty nine so it's a daytime things that kids can go right right it's yeah it's a family events of family then it's going to be civic center there and the gates open at three is is it any kind of a fundraiser for the kids that Oprah or is it just\nIt that's what it is all about like a kitchen hope a human chapter became a a a nonprofit uh about uh about a year ago we had to come up with a business plan how we were going to make money for the the nonprofit\nAnd one of those plans was a concert we just didn't think it happened this this quite so soon\nSo that the money raised for the concert or after we put aside what the cost is it all goes back and stays a hundred percent in our community and it's a for the kids\nWhat's going to be on the grass out there at the desert sun stadium\nYes going to be on the grass or so bring your lawn chairs bring your bank it's a and then we we have a variety of of music that we're offering also and those are from local bands a side hustle\nA radical re wind down time and Ross Josh all of those fans are donating their time\nFor free they're they're just coming because they want to help out the kids\nAre so that's wonderful to twenty Dollar General ... to get tickets now go to the civic center or the arts

I Believe that replaces somebody's job and I don't want that to happen so I I like to have interaction with people like or a person to\nTake my money and give me what I'm buying and said thank you didn't have a great day and what have you not\nSure but uh that's available I Know\nIt is you know 'cause I mean one thing is you wouldn't want to buy a tire on Amazon or online because I mean they sell them on line all over the place but the time a ship those tires to you and even if they ship them free and you got to go pay to have somebody balance them\nPlace but the time a ship those tires to you and even though they ship 'em free and\nYou got to go pay to have somebody balance them a mountain a dispose of your tire and that but how many factor that amount of money into which are good deal on the on line is is that you've you've I actually spent more money than what happens when that tire blows out I mean\nI guess you put it back on UPS and send it back on his side of the road and send it back to where it came from me away from bringing it tire or I always believe in in supporting your local your local businesses because when you have a problem you go back and you get taken care of right on the spot\nRight oh I just just I just\nThink support local I mean I think Amazon is great for some things but a man got heaven forbid I mean I get that if you're that busy that you can go buy a shirt store and try it on [laughter] so yeah you got enough time to get it impact and if it's the wrong one you got to get it back to you somewhere you've got to drop it off so they can send it back\nIt's not just on our age group that does that it's the younger than there are some um businesses I I started leaving a minister I Do that\nActually I Believe I'm In the younger group I'm not in the in group [laughter] than I Do research and I do respect my elders are good\nI tell you what though sometimes they're very difficult to understand but uh but I Do respect\nAnd I believe respects should be given to everybody and even sometimes when they don't show up back I still think you should take the higher road and you know just try to understand I guess one day we'll be there but it's nice to see a lot of elderly people older people that that have lived life\nSaw one at the restaurant yesterday and he walked in and he\nTold me was eighty five years old and get the Korean War and I said well you don't look at day over fifty five\nI think I live in the end of it and everything but yeah we\nDo we have a lot of wonderful people in this community and\nSo that's my a vertical for the day I guess or whatever\nYou want to let them do sense it's all we can take\nTen I'm not to stand his medical for the day but you have a great day we shouldn't be by\nThe I'm going on about a single mom when he was smoking and it's kind of unusual for former president to be out there you know ... written rules is normally they take a backseat with a new president alone\nBut is now the latest they're trying to convince everybody to be afraid of a bunch of impoverished malnourished refugees a thousand miles away that's the thing that is most important in this election\nWas not about being a ... it's about\nOur policies to open borders or we know the country but he can miss you can um you can change the optics of it only once I think we all realize what it is and I think the polling out there shows and we know what it is it's like a phone call you're on the air\nHello the mourning mourning mourning over Russ yes are you good uh\nYou know I Wish you disappear I I mean I Wish he'd just go way I should say\nMe you're talking about Obama oh little mom okay yes well yeah I think you don't know I don't want you\nTo look at ...

Clark in Cody beat the morning\nSo today we have a great show we're going to be talking about money and I like buddy yeah good good good because um this is a show about estate planning that live at the law how that works and [noise]\nYour hard work and legacy and before we get there we've got to step back a bit and understand what it takes to become financially sales in the first place\nI like the feeling of that yeah because you know that a lot of people they procrastinate the landing portion of their state and\nThat number one reason for that is they don't feel like they have in the states and you know what I was considering that and it may be true maybe they don't have in the states but they should um okay so\nLet let me qualify both those statements should everybody be rich no\nI mean you dedicate your life to what\nSatisfies and fulfills you write what gives you purpose now the accumulation of money at that\nFollows that pursued in great um but you do have a legacy no matter what you want somebody to be in charge of perpetuating that legacy and keeping your memory alive and that is in the state plan and then the other aspect of it is a lot of people do acquire\nUm things that are you do need to be taking care of them passed on and if they if they don't have an estate plans set out then it's going to quickly just be dispersed and is going to be like just in the wind is their legacy and everything they worked for their entire life is going to be gone so let\nLet's focus a little bit on money and money problems and what are some fallout and and negative effect that occurs because the money problems so let's let's hit\nOne right off the bat when big issue divorce\nSo divorce is\nI don't know if you want to call it an epidemic in the United states I worked in the world you know and the number one cause of divorce or would you what we did they give you just\nThrowing them out their financial is financial so you know in some other options out there might be infidelity or in compatibility or just falling out of love as opposed and I'm not going to argue the merits if either of those issues that what I Am going to address is that hands down if\nIf you look at the research financial problems are the number one cause a divorce so\nWhat's causing this financial problem is it that uh we live in a depressed market where it's it's too difficult to acquire that needs to sustain life\nYou know so there's money around us and sometimes I feel I feel like I'm In one of those phone booth and gets mentioned this before in Las Vegas where you can go into the phone booth and there's there's dollars and there's a hundred dollar bills way our building one dollar bills and they're in the cycle\nOf the fact that they're swirling all around us and you get like one minute and the phone booth the ground as much as you can and then that's a ... and ... they're going around you so quickly very little and uh and\nI feel like sometimes that's the society\nThat we live and there's a lot of money circulating around it seems like everybody else has some faith I Can't get my hands on it right and and watch and and it's I felt more like that in the times that\nUh I don't focus and and I'm balancing from one idea that someone that's what I Want that would do I want this and that was instead of really focusing on one thing and that persevering setting out a plan and and keeping\n... ... where you muck cubs to talk [noise]\nLifting for life and the law was that if I could go wrong [noise]\nWelcome back you know that the light that the law showing garter and studio with rep Clark and Cody beef than we are talking about financial stability and getting your\nFinances in order ... we're going over the principles that that build up that structure of financial security ... and the very basic was the foundation of the house if you will is the\nFaith that you can do this or that commitment that getting out of debt they that that is possible whether you make thirty thousand dollars a year or whether with three hundred thousand dollars and it doesn't it really does a you build a budget or whatever yeah\nMhm and and the more money you make the more ways you find that bad as as a player I have a unique opportunity to review hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands but\nThousands or [noise]\nYou hundreds and thousands or hundreds of thousands but thousands of individuals in their financial situation and all different walks of life and all different occupation so that book rich dad for dad yeah right it's a best\nSeller out there it's a wonderful book and I I can testify that\nIt is valid in in the point that it expresses and and the points are that keeping to a budgeting and and uh only spending the money that you have there\nIs more important than making a lot of money because the the whole premise behind that book is that uh\nYou can there's a wealthy person that we you know typically defined as making a lot of money and and having a lot of things nice house nice car and stuff like that and a person a more modest means that makes a very moderate salary but\nEnded up saving quite a bit of money just because\nThe sale and financial decisions and then not talking about investment and invested in the market in and and I'm being able to get a bigger return on his money just not spending more than he ... he made and and that is the crunch of it and it and then it sounds so simple but it really is difficult and ah\nSo this ... is said to um make sure that you can store to believe that you can do this in communication communication is absolutely critical because\nMost times your financial stability isn't just you it it has to do with you and your relationship with somebody else right and I'm I'm graduate that in there that unity were spouse on the foundation is so important because you've got the same page right won't work if one's going one way ones go near the ...\nYou have to communicate you have to communicate to the idea that you're going to do this and both be equally committed to it and then a assigning responsibility or blame\nFor you know who got us into debt that that I think is his one of the big issues that results in ... oh yeah but who served by so we get it because we watched it whenever you have a phone call so that you're on the air this let alone\nHave well good morning you guys morning said this fight he a little off since we're talking about money or I keep hearing about\nA a lock\nStock uh you know the marijuana start out that you can invest in and become millionaires overnight or what is there any validity to that is there any basis in that uh uh\nThose comments about marijuana well\nI'm Glad that you called in and brought this up because I'm I'm not going to comment on on the [noise] how well pot stock is going to do for bitcoin or anything else that's\nOut there but I think that that question brings up a different point that I Do want to address and the point is getting rich off of a singular idea for concepts that doesn't require a lot of perspiration and perseverance is\nNot a good plan it it's not a sale and financial plan what we're talking about here today in in what the concept that I Want to communicate is in order to become financially sound uh you shouldn't be gambling and sex\nSo one stock that of the gamble\nAnd and so that right by as far as that goes I have no speculation as to how well it's going to do for the morality of investing in that a particular type of a product but\nI'm just trying to get wealthy without putting in the time and effort of earning money and that means that that you need to sustain life is is not a good concept of bread office and we play\nNow but yeah I I understand that completely and uh uh uh every day is a gamble starts out as a gamble\nYou know a gambling got you're going to get out of bed without a falling out or bad [laughter] you know or something you do in a classroom and got on into a coffee pot or whatever you know it's down so every day's a gamble but I but\nFinances are a whole different ball of wax too so uh I understand your point and um so you guys have a good day okay\nGreat thanks for the call Cody you're about to talk about you know we've seen this in the past\n... any anybody who like you just explained you know it takes hard work to get there and you've seen the people that have or will the lottery winners for example the people that instantly come into money there instantly out of it or you know and\nShowing you actually are given a I don't know if you're going in this direction today but you actually give a factor a figure of how many people receiving inheritance and how long that exploit laugh yeah you know when\nWe talk about that during our seminars and we and and we bring it up at the very beginning because\nThe point of our type of the state plan is to help continue your legacy whether that be a financial or whether it'd be based on um [noise] what you aspire to accomplish in your life in other ways and we talked about how most people most Americans don't have a plan and\nThe average time for\nSomeone that inherit money to spend that inheritance let's just take a typical family if a child receives inheritance your mom and dad and ... and let's put it in perspective their inheritance is what mom and dad worked for over a lifetime safe then that inheritance within one year\nAnd they're worse off financially after the fact than they were before they receive the inheritance and that is the commonly over looked little statistic that they're\nThey're worse off after the fact and I think what it comes down to is um when you come into a sum of money you lose the foundational principles that lead to financial security and that is um ... hard work budgeting and\nRelying on on a constant source that is\nProvided by you so let's go back to these foundational principles that build this house we talked about faith commitment communication so that is the foundation faith commitment communication nail the walls are built up a two essential\nPillars the first one is budget give God of budget if you don't look at how much you are spending\nAnd then you see yourself before you can start you know you've you've got to know how much you're spending and you've got to make you better prioritize where you're spending goes and so the impulsive habits\nThe emotional buying gets curtailed because most buying his emotional really yeah most\n... ... as far as that the dollar amount I Would I Would\nI wouldn't I don't know if I go with the dollar mail it quicker the amount of transactions\nRight your mortgage paying their mortgages not um emotional but um and and that may make up a larger portion of your budget but if you're going through your day how many transactions take place and how many are based off your emotion now and then enter stars emotions on base and I'm Talking about appetites as well\nRight later like I'm hungry okay\nWell I haven't planned for this and I'm passing by a fast food joints and now I'm going through the line and I'm I'm getting you know I I can justify that dollar burger or even at three dollar meal\nBut then I go into the line and like you know what I Am really Thursday to and so let's\nGet a soda you know what let's upgraded to a smoothie because I Want to stay healthy right so many there were to steer away from the soda and you continue to justify or to snowball effect and now you've got this movie and you've got the sandwich and are you by the
