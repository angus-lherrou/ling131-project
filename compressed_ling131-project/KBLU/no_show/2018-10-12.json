advised me placement and that's what caused a recession of filed after a high rate is that he didn't balanced the two\nHe sold via inflation coming in but he didn't you know balance that with consumer inflation and that didn't exist in this would happen as you've had him taking a break but wage growth were weren't matching it is always sold was the buying of level of costs going up in the business sector not consumer sector\nAnd those rates row you took the money out of people's pockets but then it was a snowball effect as things get more expensive people weren't making money\nYou know we saw the same thing would have happened in nearly two thousands had they kept ... you know raising rates but after the first trillion and a half economic package that went through rates should have went out and they should have gradually have\nGone up but we kept a low for way too long right and what happens in Wall Street if it's six months or more that becomes a standard ... and you know we had him for almost a decade at below at one point five which is just it's not sustainable that third world country concepts\nThe oil and I know you want to talk about what a little bit before we do\nA particle was that how the other day about Donald Trump is saving the you drivers money because he released some regulation on ethanol now\nWhich we can sell all year round there when they have more of it in support of farmers who grow corn but for me out some of those big lie it doesn't help with decision sees it doesn't it doesn't stretch the gallon I'd I'd I don't know what it is is it's it's a program to grow more corn or do you see it differently\nWell no the original concept was during the energy crisis is that was looking in a way to to prop up their individual sectors if you remember who are\nPolitical leaders back then were all from the middle of the country and then that's an awesome magically appeared as our savior uh but I I don't see I don't know enough about automotive and cars and it does it improve fields and she that's\nNot for me to say okay what I Would I Do know is that it the price of corn commodity did go up once that was announced so fast ... outside of it you know over I look at you know oil I mean that's always what\nFifteen Percent of a gas and oil and gas is\nYou know a percentage of the cause of oil so you said how corn maybe or maybe not your the car guy I Know I don't know all does for a few ocean fussy or climate change or would although I have a jazz they got to throw in there I looked strictly at the at the price of oil but sadly enough is up a sixty one sense right now I Love the Seventy ... to\n... ... you don't think it's up for any reason as as far as the supply and demand seems to be fine and we got an abundance of of oil in storage\nBe for any reason as as far as a supply and demand seems to be fine and we got an abundance of of oil in storage and we've got production there and\nIt is actually where I said it would be I said you're looking in between Seventy and Seventy five dollars a barrel is we're going to put it it it got to cross that for a couple of days and then the industry can around and said oh by the way we're holding six million more barrels and everybody thought we were\nUm there is a political balanced currently with oil during midterms in during presidential elections and that is one political party says we should\nBecome energy and independent and other political party says we should shut down all oil activity nuts and in in the middle eastern countries will give it to us\nRight so the one party that says we should keep oil going currently seems to have an uptick in their political advantages\nSo you know we saw up oil simply going out today because it went down three percent over two days and people are just trying to get in hoping that it takes back up again for as well as you saw that a president G and President Trump are going to meet\nAt the G ... summit and the whole fleet come to some kind of agreement\nBut as far as the at the pump we're not going to see any real big fluctuations before you think it'll pretty close to where it is\nI think you might see a penny or to come down and gas but that's about it I I don't think you're going to see a main dropped out in order to see some I mean we're down ten ten on refined gasoline\nFutures which no usually translate into a reduction of two or three cents pumped but that's about it\nAnd so\nWhen when you get a case like this you're using algae though they may be wrong with that but um I said you know people like Edward when when the lifeguards or tell them to get out of the financial water you know we're sitting there with the long board looking for opportunities jumping in\nDoes exactly what we did we sweet locked ourselves smile my dear beloved daughter treated out she goes to dad and the guys are all locked away in the office and\nWhat we do [laughter] information to see what had gone down to the point where okay these are our target market some are going after this stuff\nOkay so we did it does create a ... up of of the of of energy for you guys 'cause that's where he does okay and and then you guys were people would panic but you're not that part of it\nRight I mean would soon as we see a market goes down there is a great quote that says every dollar you invest in the market it should be a dollar you were able to lose plus fifty cents\n[laughter] coach on and that is the way it is you should just expect every dollar you but at the market has never coming back plus to fifty cents it costs you to put that dollar and the market um\nAnd if you can work like that and you can survive then you're fine because on down markets you do as I told everybody were to date hold and if you're not holding by that in the end of the into the down drip because sooner or later when the drop below ... percent\nOver last to be that was a target that was the flag oh hey we need to start seeing what's up and now you're looking at everything across the board is green\nSo anyone who got in at the very bottom and where you can look at the very bottom is when the big spike sub of jumped more than five percent that is when the the the bottom of the market is about to reveal itself and we got to end we took a little hit in the beginning but this morning\nI got a phone call and my daughter turned on the market and she saw that four hundred plus market on a on the arrow and she said dad did not going to be busy today\nAnd I looked at it and said why his because everything's going up and this is when you go play\nOkay okay good [laughter]\nAnd I'm Madeline seven on\nYour way can we talk about the Chinese ... little bit you know got a new NAFTA\nA contract we're about ready to eating the you contract\nAnd uh you know you're saying that\nA contract we're about ready to eat the you contract and uh you know you're saying that these coming over to talk to Trump because I think he's starting to feel like he's not going to get the ante up at the game\nUh where are we think that there's going to be a new deal on their\nWeight\nYou have to look I don't think they're going to deal ... which you have to remember is that the Chinese were going to different type of social structure than we do there even though they are educators ship per se\nThere's no real actions they still have to maintain face or their upper level that Sean will simply push out the bad guy and find somebody else\nThough they have to look carefully like I said they're market last seven and a half percent on top of the Fifteen Percent they've already last year to date so they're deep\nAnd financial read I'm One of the key factors that they showed was that they open up their bond markets to foreigners and they have announced that they're trying to increase the Silk Road but there's also a lot of countries Pakistan Malaysia Indonesia all rejected it\nBecause when the U.S comes to do so so project we come in his grants China comes in with debt\nSo they are desperately trying to get their economy going now I'm a marker that was most interesting and Chinese affairs was that Louis Vuitton announced\nInternally in China they had a five and a half percent drop in sales that\nTells you that the middle class in China that that became of age during this time is running out of cash because\nThey're not buying it and that is a market that she needs to work on if his middle class and he's developed sinks any further\nThere's going to be problems and then the to turn into a political problem for him but you don't see anything happening with China till after the elections do\n[noise] if she was ... smart she would not he wouldn't do anything I'm ... I'm you know if you noticed the meetings taking place after the elections right I'm the only political item we have going on right now financially or watching is the pastor from turkey and\nReally that's a big deal for you\n[noise] that it's an item because as\nTurkey's you know their bond market their overall\nTheir parents either dead areas of all I'm going into the toilets and they've been leading the emerging markets down and with that as turkey goes down the rest of the emerging markets are being somewhat following\nSo if Iran can get himself back in the good graces of the west is a chance to debate the reversal of money flowing out of emerging market nickel back nobody likes to invest in a market that might possibly become you know nationalized nobody wants to have Venezuela again\nRight good but what is it is a good point the finger at the Saudis and say Saudis murdered him and I got proof I mean I it seems\nTo know them that's a journalist this is a pastor from turkey this the Saudi is the\nJournal the journalists OK okay does does ... that's not we're not caring about [laughter] that cares about the so Ira nobody's caring about the journal is\nVery good [laughter] those are those concerns\nAre worried about the church pastor they'd been holding since two thousand and sixteen he is an item and that's the that's right now that's causing a freeze because the U.S has put actually a few semi sanctions in Turkey about this so we can clear this up turkey can look at rejoining the NATO nations of investments\nAnd would that'd be a carrot at our we would normally hold brutal foreign policy um\nOh that's a massive ... haven't played in many many years but one that's about time that we have played it because you know the turkey can't afford it and that's a second home to me I I spent almost two years of my life living his doubles so I I pay close attention to what happens there\nAh their advantage of them quickly I didn't know that it was all now by I

they don't say it like they've been doing lately\nAnd now they've been saying that the organized the organized screaming at the cabinet hearings and all that that the public didn't want to watch it any more they were tired of they were done with it\nAnd so that they might put a lid on it for a little while senator out of North Dakota again a is just upset about\nAbout Hillary says I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides and she's a Democrat running for her life behind them in the polls and when when Hillary comes out and says as it's noteworthy it hurts her it hurts the Democrats and\nThe fly over states but I don't think Hillary cares about North Dakota\nI think Hillary cares about the states Trump won she cares about the coast scares about Chicago in the coast it's about it\nNew York to LA all those coastal those coastal regions I think uh I think they'd like to go get do away with electro college so the only the coasts counts so we want to count on the coast to be a disaster\nKentucky representative a Rand Paul and I remember he was beat up last year ... grass somebody came in broke some ribs\nIs ribs serious attack my neighbor because that victory also called going on out there that kind of anger that mob stuff's going on spoiling people up\nYou know Steve squeeze being shot as well as it was an attempt to shoot many Republicans think that there was security\n[noise] well\n... center a Rand Paul says I feared is going to be an assassination I really worry that somebody is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this escalates\nTo violence now listening to some of the Democrats on the talk shows this morning and last night\nAs the\nCommentators point now like look this this ratcheting up is ridiculous this mob rule is ridiculous what they did the Kavanaugh with Eric\nHolder and all the others Maxine Waters Dianne Feinstein it's it's it's not healthy and that is funny the Democrats not knowing what to say well it will Trump's fall Trump started it all Trump did it\nAnd what is Trump said that we need to do away with civility when does Trump Trump Trump will take somebody on he absolutely will say they're not smart low IQ\nAbsolutely\nIt doesn't go in it's time to kick 'em it doesn't go in that he did one time at a rally in I think early sixteen or somebody was fighting with them or the security guards or something and he says something like take that guy out you know take him out you know I'm a that was the only time and they and they still repeat it 'cause it was only time you're going to be about a single individual\nThat was causing a problem that Trump's at Trump's violent look at this one time and and yet the same presses during that never says anything about holder really not CNN and all those other they'll talk about a Hillary Clinton same you know let's not do civility no Trump said at once\nAbout an individual and rally that was a little bit out of control and probably a paid operatives they had that early on a lot of those paid operatives to make is rallies look violence\nDidn't work or monitor can moron and they control than I think\nPaid operatives to make is rallies look violence didn't work or motor can more control than I think\nThe Democrats thought they would be and that was just a normal thing I don't think he does a rally where somebody doesn't scream obscenities or tried to get attention or quickly is just escorted often and Trump always pointed out like there's that one guy again\nTrump always pointed out and I think it I I think his fans are looking for I think the people in the rallies are looking for it like where is the one who's going to be who's going to spout off\nAnd to be wished out here and and uh I guess it he hasn't Trump is not challenge anybody for over two years other than a so there's that one guy let's get them out of here\nDid security had nothing to say didn't wanna talk he just wants to scream and yell and run out and that's a that's been his thing\nA Hyundai of Yuma of course sponsored

I'll do color commentary there [laughter]\nYou buy a house go there and got that's it you know that's all we haven't talked about you know the bombs went off yesterday or not you'll upset September yes yeah September and and it takes a little while for it to take effect for you if you started to see the interest rates well and as you get\nYes it's it's been obvious if you look back over the line I mean we've been talking about this for the last several years but you know if if you look it's funny that you say that because finally the major media both Fox and CNN on Wednesday put out stats and I've got screen shots of them that say the average interest rate is now over five\n... I did read that okay so but I understand that when they're publishing staff like that that the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac average for somebody with a seven forty credit score putting twenty percent down on a conventional purchased so\nHow many people don't have twenty percent down with seven forty credit scores et cetera which is mostly rare so obviously interest rates for everybody other than a twenty percent down seven forty credit score\nAre going to be higher so everything's safely over five and everything and I'm really safely over five unless you're buying it down and that's what I'm starting to see a ton of\nHis people offering what appears to be great low rates but when you dig in there to discount points there's an origin nation point I mean most of the major banks online right now if you actually click through the assumptions you're paying two and a half to three discount points to get those ridiculously low rates\nWhen you see the major media saying hey interest rates are firmly over five percent now\nThey're over five and that's still a great rate I mean compared to when we're ugly historically a great great you know when I bought my first home I was thrilled that seven when you bought your first home Russia I'm sure it was in the double digits\n[noise] no I don't think you know it was close it was like nine or something okay with that but I didn't I didn't buy during the seventies I'm not that old and\nIt was in the eighties early eighties you are that old I'm ... but you know historically when you look at at rates three years ago we were talking about rates that were down in the threes and then we kept telling everybody know their firmly in the forest nobody wanted to believe that\nNow we've been telling people that they're comfortable in the fives for most people now everybody is starting to realize it but what does that do in terms of their purchasing price\nIf you say somebody who the average home here and you almost somewhere between one fifty and two hundred depending on if it's first time homebuyer or move up but let's take a two hundred thousand dollar purchase if the loan was two hundred thousand at four percent interest just principal and interest not taxes and insurance that payments nine hundred and fifty\nOh was two hundred thousand at four percent interest just principal and interest not taxes and insurance that payments nine hundred and fifty five dollars a month and that's a thirty or thirty or fix to look at using four percent interest rate\nWent interest rates go to five which the major media is now telling you they're five that payment goes to a thousand Seventy four great that's a hundred and twenty dollars more months approximately\nBut when interest rates go to six now that payment goes to another Ninety nine wow when interest rates go to seven and I'm telling you they're gonna get there at some point in the next few years that payment goes the thirteenth thirty one now look what that does that purchasing power to them by or you know you can go backwards and I don't even want to tell people what that pain that would be when they were in the low threes\nBut makes them cry if you if you had bought that home at four percent and your payment is nine fifty five when interest rates go to six which they'll be in the sex is in the next year and that payment goes in near twelve hundred that's a twenty six percent increase in your payment\nThat's a huge difference in somebody's ... and\nThat's when somebody has a look at their budget J I can only forward so much money a month and then find a house that fits and on the current rates\nSo we've talked about you know as interest rates go up there just simply reduces somebody's purchasing power but we never really talked about the percentage increases you know when when Tom and his gang or on the air they talk about percentage increases in the market you I think were referencing the Dow is a drop over the last week bonds up over the last month\nBut you know when you say that your your payment could go up twenty six percent\nThat's a ... that's life changing budget altering numbers yes so why is the housing market so strong now it's kind of like that the the fence sitters that wanted to wait for the bottom now realize the bottom was a long time ago\nBut also because the employment numbers are real low the unemployment low a average income is is really ticked up for middle class is really ticked up to historic highs\nSo people are getting confident they feel like tomorrow is going to be even better next year is going to be better in feeling confident in the in the in everything around them so yeah that's there's a there's people driving out there to buy\nWhich when you when you start to see those macroeconomic things that people are saying hey it's a great time to buy the economy is doing well and why do you think builders are building homes\nOr the schedule confrontational three to nine Seventeen hundred securities offered to help your financial services never ... bc\n[noise]\n\nGood morning ... branch manager with academy mortgage on a gorgeous friday morning\nAh it's like I don't know eight Seventeen eight twenty in the morning I Can't keep track as Russia it's cooler deeds keeps the clocks off and the ones have Twenty one that you know All right and and it's much cooler\nBreezes flowing so I mean just a a a great day all around now you were talking about you're going to win the lottery this weekend is I've got I think it's a half billion dollars on the mega something whatever it is okay I'm going to go buy a ticket\nRight you by taking a I'll buy a ticket and the chances are like one in like a hundred million or something like ... million when when they say Canada is it like that's right you got to play so chances are not good I don't I wouldn't go spin and they're looking through catalogs she would you go to well they don't call it a poor man's tax for nothing it's what it is and unfortunately that's what it is however\nWhen it gets to this level all go buy a couple of tickets just for the fun of it to me too I think I think that's I think that's why they accelerate so much and when they get to this high they they start\nBringing in big money you're you're on the air\nA rest it's probably not the foothills hey Brian is going to call in with a a little story\nNow I'm back in the\nLower Ninth or early nineties my sister was a branch manager or um ... when I'm ... I'm and rock homes with my time on there a new home mortgage like\nAnd it was really really interesting no let me go down there this was in Lancaster, California um and like I said it was interesting because when we first moved out their cars were are lining up\nFor two three days with people living in their cars and our relatives take over for them to be able to buy a lot in the first case yeah\nBecause they did they tell you like right over to Monday morning so people get their friday and camp yeah yeah\nYeah yeah and then by the end at the time we were out there things have gotten so bad that they were\nUm the builders are actually paying off a credit card paint a uh amount that people load anything to get their debt race\nWe paint off a credit card paint a a amounts that people load anything to get their debt ratio in line so they could buy the house\nI'm In this had to do two things one or not several aerospace companies moving out to Georgia\nAnd telling their employees if you if you can sell your house and move with it she got a job otherwise you're out of luck and all of a sudden all these are two three four years old homes were asked for sale signs up for five six as many as Ken on the block\nMhm and then the other part was uh uh\nThey said the rule of thumb out there at that time was Ukraine's allow your improved land price should be more than thirty percent of your expected sale price\nAnd everything had been booming and below them and and these guys were buying land like there was no create like there was no tomorrow yeah but it crashed but um yeah they [laughter] guys\nThat I worked with and because I was a a a real for law they sent one of the guys I work with to the Philippines to find a guy that owned a five acres in the middle of what was going to be a planned a community development\nMhm not right where they were going to be\nPutting in malls and all that with a a check for a or with a contract to pay ten million dollars for this little piece of land 'cause otherwise he was just going to be an eyesore right in the middle of all this\nI'd like to I'd like to get part of that appreciated the Gulf like you know I care but I I never wasn't on the news when are you a million dollars would that would be nice yeah well when you win the lottery this weekend and you can and that's why I'm going to do I'm going to win by one to again I'm sure it's going to be it\nWell and then that would probably be all you need but you know what what the caller was talking about is there were so much speculation before and that's the one thing that I don't see\nAnywhere right now you don't have the big American land grab you don't have people going out buying up huge tracks because they're going to develop a thousand homes at a time so I'm you know the builders and let's let's be honest you my is such a small community you get to know everybody\nThe farmers in the ad community are so smart with their resources I mean they know how to turn the most dirt for the least amount of money and use the least amount of water to grow in\nThe builders here in town same thing they're sitting on the right amount of dirt they know when to turn when not to turn out when to sell off some equipment when to buy some equipment um you you didn't see this big lottery game if you will like you saw like the caller the caller mentioned\nYou didn't see people speculating and risking their life savings in their families fortune on land and then it crashed you know yeah and let's hope not but you know again you talked about the right time\nYou mentioned well you know the economy's up and jobs around what does that mean to the individual\nRuss does the economy good or bad change your personal job\nNo but it can change your attitude and confidence right and so that's\nThe thing that's changing is is most people have had a job all the way through Ross you had a job all the way through\nYou you talk about the confidence and that kind of snowballs into more people's confidence men uncle hurling ... ... talk about hey it's a great time to buy and so you feel better about it but the numbers for the person who has been working this whole time\nHaving changed you know and and that person who could have bought when interest rates were three and a half and now is going to buy when there are five knows they're paying more for that house and they could have but they're willing to do it now because they feel it's the right time\nRight and you got to feel comfortable and\nThose they're paying more for that house and they could've\nBut they're willing to do it now because they feel it's the right time right and you got to feel comfortable and that's the biggest thing is there's a whole group of people that were waiting and just holding out\nNow they're buying because now they feel like it's a good time to buy because they see a the news be the economic numbers see every one of their friends has purchased\nAnd so you're starting to see you know one nurse at the hospital buys and all of a sudden three other nurses on the floor with her or him now they want to go by and conveniently it's kind of in the same area sure I'm that's what you're seeing the most obvious that one or two friends that starts it\nI was on three or four or five people and you see that happen in your business over and over actually um had a call from a past client is so funny that Laura who works as a nurse\nI'm purchased about five years ago and she you know I have that speech with everybody who's younger who's working the talks about hey this is probably a five year gig for you you know most people are not in their home for sixty years and they die in the home anymore\nAnd so she called me she goes hey Derek you know you're right I'm starting to think about another home can I sit down with yet and so we sat down and she's going to keep her current home as a rental good for her keep as an investment and she's going to move up and buy a new home she's got kind of an expanded family\nOne more child and they had before and now it makes sense for them to move up so they're gonna buy a new home and have a rental\nWell guess what happened in the last two days rates went\nNo she three other nurses into civilian nurses okay and now it but see that's what happens is you know one person finally gets the idea and so she is she's picking her neighbors she is she really is it actually is a well probably two of the three I'm not sure that the third one well but you know you\nTalk about okay there's whole groups of people that bought four five six seven years ago that now have equity in their home they have even more income because again\nMost people's income goes up over time you know sometimes a little sometimes a lot but as your income goes up you're purchasing power should go up\nShe's buying before the rates continue to march on and it just makes complete sense so um but it's so fun when one of the past customers calls and says hey Derek you said this I really want to explore that\nNow is your is your business still pretty booming I mean is it is it right now I'm saturated\nI wouldn't call saturated but it it's consistently steadily good it'll get its people that are making really good decisions\nI'm spending lots of time with people so you know the typical customer sits in for an hour and a half sometimes two hours talking about all of the ... and the whys and what happens if we do this versus that\nUm but no business has been really good for myself and everybody in the branch and truly the the human market has been strong for the last four or five years\nAnd we don't see any sign of slowing down anytime in the near future\nNo not not at all and again you know the the ... precursor to that is if you saw builders sitting with lots of home you know lots of inventory that's a problem if you looked at the MLS data several years ago we had about a two year supply of homes on the market\nNow right now we're anywhere between three and six month's supply depending on which which um range of value of house you want but if you're saying you could go put a you know a a bread and butter three bedroom two bath home on the market price it well and it's probably sold in thirty to forty five days\nWent all and redo the titles redo the loans redo everything yes a lot of loan companies though they block it that they don't want to take the one's name off\nWell they don't want to because if you have two people signing on a note you get rid of one you have fifty percent of your lawyer to go out the window\nRight better chance and why would they want to they don't want to\nWhere they said there's no reason for that you know most of the time it's a whole new refinance it's a whole new loan um now mortgages most people don't realize this there is something called a spousal delete\nSo let's say husband wife get divorced wife gets the house she can call her current mortgage company and say look I'd like to do a spousal delete\nI Need to re qualify for the lone just with my income and if that person can prove they have the income the assets and the credit to qualify on their own they can delete the other spouse\nBut they have to carry the entire debt on their own with all of their remaining debt why would you want to do that well when interest rates were going down nobody talked about spousal delete cause which is better to refinance and save some money monthly now that interest rates have gone up\nLook if you have that four percent interest rate and you and I just\nThe league because it was just better to refinance and save some money monthly now that interest rates have gone up\nLook if you have that four percent interest rate and you and I just talked about interest rates are at five ... it would be way better to try that spousal delete and keep your existing pain they want to delete 'em anyway well you you you do but that's all everything is um\nBut so there's lots of programs out there that people just don't talk about ... and you know candidly if you'd call most lenders and you are in a position to do a spousal delete they probably won't tell you about it\nThey'd probably just rather do a refinance so they earn some revenue and have another transaction and feel good that they made some money when you know most people that are calling really want advice it's going to the doctor saying hey doc this hurts\nI just want you to fix it I don't want you to sell me Fifteen things I don't need tell me how to fix my problem so that person who's saying hey I Need to refinance my home because we just went through a divorce it might be actually cheaper faster better for them just to do is spousal delete\nSo and you can you help with those things also well I can kind of guide and tell you that that if I'm doing alone\nThe likelihood is it's a whole new loan um if it's one that we've done before absolutely internally I can help with all of those things but if it's not my loan I can just kind of tell you what you do write to you to what you need to do and and help them as a where they need to go\nIn and we do that a lot I mean I Love listening when I walked through the halls and you listen to how bill or re or tear or ... you know all of the people in the branch when they're giving advice I mean I just heard bill say no this refinance is not the right thing for you you could do these few things\nIn your way better a ... way better off now\nDid bill turn away a refinance yes did he give up income yes but did he do the right thing for that customer yes\nAnd that's what matters long run for the way you go to as much as you go to business to build 'em clientele let's return customers while I Want\nReturn customers but even more so I Want people to get financially had you know it when you say building prosperity one of one of the three things that I I Love about academy as\nThere's three phrases that I've really gravitated to that academy says it's inspiring hope delivering dreams building prosperity seriously I I'm not kidding you and that is part of your control is three core beliefs for Adam a mortgage\nAnd when you say building prosperity for me that's exactly resonating with me of how do you build some rental properties how to every five years do you buy a new home what what can we help people do financially over at twenty thirty year period for their family\nAnd that right there bill would rather help that person financially make a really good decision than financially profit off of a transaction where my guess is that person is going to see what Bill just did and send more friends and family in in\nThe long play because you're building community trust correct and that's part of your your deal also well\nIn again I I Believe everybody in our branch would do that even if this was a big city but human such a small town that look when when I see what fries or Walmart or albertson's\nI Want to have a great conversation just like you and I do a crush on her phone and say hey how is everything and I want lower to say my man I just bought that second home with you I Can't believe we own a rental and now we have something for our financial future all three of our kids now have their own bedroom again where previously you know two of them were sharing\nAnd we're moving up the American food chain and and it's the American dream\nThat I Love that conversation and that's why I get in the office at five o'clock in the morning that's why I Love staring at the fish tank and seeing the flag and oh by the way\nYour station and that's why I get in the office at five o'clock in the morning that's why I Love staring a fish tank and seeing the flag and oh by the way you said if I win the lottery I have to put a bigger fly pullout\nFrasier yeah I mean this one's great but I mean if you if you get a noxious money needed the bunkers flag\nSo what you're saying is if the lottery is one than we have to put a garrison flag up\nOh gosh us okay yeah one that uh that people go with the actually do\nI Wonder if we have to call because that sixteenth street is actually highway Ninety five I Wonder if we'd have to call a dot and get permission to have a flag that because that would stretch over sixty street they\nJust ask forgiveness its allies over\nReally so I did I coached show and cannot say you know here's my answer Ross Clark said I could go there you\nKnow wait you know but you know that's I think that the fun part of the businesses you and I can be silly and sarcastic here and just have a good conversation and I love doing that with customers Fisher I Love having that conversation of\nHey Laura this is what you want to do five years from now give me a call when you're ready to to turn your first home into a rental\nAnd people are doing it in the market has been so good lately that you're starting to see the move up buyer you know the person who was in an apartment\nWas buying homes three to four years ago now those people are starting to think hey I could move up I could buy a bigger home and I either have equity that I can turn this home into a rental or I can sell it and take that equity and use that as my down payment on my new home and you like working with those either one of them are great so you know what let's take another
