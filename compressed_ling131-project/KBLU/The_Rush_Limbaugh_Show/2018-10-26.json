Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down\nNow in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers van\nAh down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today as Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report\nThis that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\nChuck Todd said that he theory the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now\nAnd that is so all of this confusion Chuck\nTodd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scare is dividing the country and that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press\nDaily\nNow I the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press have Chuck Todd\nWho believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under to believe the Russians stole the two thousand sixteen election\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nIs do you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the themes day thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is I mean Democrats in the deep state loses they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we can't our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here sent this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do you set the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nHere reading that he'll eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do I think Trump will be the one ram routing it once these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will\nA mandate about him they if they really sorry\nBecause you think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there's no wrong answer who don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that we're supposed to be such trouble for the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this was going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the ...\nI Will share something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde harassment keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff\nAnd it's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day two thousand six day and they haven't been in various stages of\nPanic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it\nWriting about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result that's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says\nBut if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um it was like I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with the\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistaken the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct dismissing now they're starting to begin to\nMay be this is not an oddity navy navy we're not the majority and it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that\nA Trump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum to vote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went on a Trump rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river\nAnd I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was sitting like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men are going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you vote against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now\nBut they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing their sleeves like these crazy radical leftist they're all doing\nWell it is it is a it's it's standard\nOld conventional wisdom thinking that people's voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that uh this week a bomb scare stories can dampen\nEnthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more made I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continued you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is and I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm or gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it that was it's as important now is it wasn't too thousand sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now is it two years ago on a campaign and I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back then it was just words he said\nWas just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I
