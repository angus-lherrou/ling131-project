delivered [noise]\nChuck Grassley grass they said hey there's nothing new in this everything in this we knew which was\nThey still\nHaven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset folks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate balls the forge testimony they weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate a sweat neck\nThey weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seventh FBI investigation into brand cabin on\nThe left is out there but they didn't talk to Dr Ford didn't drunk and Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath what more can the FBI or do you think the FBI really thinks that these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that Dr forged testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline\nOr the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or cabinet ... ... talk that Kavanaugh for how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath and so the the thing is no reason to talk to them they go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying they'd be I couldn't find anything\nSo I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\n\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost that gives a little CNN report it only looks a little to me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough\nUh not just among them but among people on the rise in general and now here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I\nHad been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they planted supporter Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections right now I'm\nSo this this is happening and the only\nPrimary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reactions to it I've even\nSeen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually re unite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran the operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park I mean he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people have not lived through Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first\nAnd that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen anyone be smeared more\nThan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse cabinet has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact\nShe's been vindicated by evidence he'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life where I Lived when\nYou boil all this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes are urging Rick House Republicans are go ahead and vote for capital is a way this was back firing on them\nDon't know that it's a ...\nAnd only time will tell when we get to the vote but\nThe FBI investigation that the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover\nFor both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake we don't know where Murkowski is

well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly folks without an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't remember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats all boy for did the Democrats in that committee really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nomination\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this ... nothing other than the way this is all this has managed to all they've got ... they really thought\nThat this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought this has been a scam\nFrom the get go and if they are all in on the scam and at the scam was delay hence the late release of of Dr Ford's letter detailing all of this so they work out a ... office and they're all stone faced\nMaybe they thought that they had flake or maybe they thought they were going to get Collins Collins inflated have come out and once they have said so far remembered the votes not going to be they'll Saturday now so anything can change\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that he's just position only unable to restrain his impulse to divide us his mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and the not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senators and house you and numerous other say\nThat President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this is who he is he can't help it\nMr Sassaman gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump\nHas a behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing and really briefly explained that began in setting up what's to come next when President Trump\nOriginally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's allied and his death needs to go on Trump's and all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord so yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue as seemed to dump detail with what the swamp things\nBut then\nA few days or are we go by and the president's becomes a way he is and he starts speaking out against it\nOn the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called\nPacing and it relaxes the opposition in any number of way she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew\nRight off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not marker\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff\nOn Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on to the drive by us we're never gonna tell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally ...\nBecause he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors gave me the favorite who am I got Trump is always uses horrible because it is in your main he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony\nDonald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony that drive by media did not report on on the none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible they did not tell their audiences that the foreign people foreign place in the room when her incident\nHappened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you\nBut people watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the foreign witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nDrive by us we're not reporting any of that the drive by as were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital was guilty\nSo Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't always she got home she gets it on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never\nHeard the truth about Dr\nChristine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of the millions who had never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\nDetail that for people in his rally\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest media millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous the people\nThese protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told them the\nDemocrats senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate him\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls e foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little\nCherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his goal literally insane but if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump did say at millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrat senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump's strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nSense we humans Russia [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm

for the third week of the month reported this morning both numbers came in lower than expected and continues the story from yesterday's ATP employment report that we discussed in the broadcast the numbers lead up to the unemployment gauge for September that will be reported tomorrow morning\nThe expectation is that the employment rate will dropped three point eight percent\nThis would rival some of the low numbers that we saw back all the way the Nineteen sixties goodnight state's economy\nAnd this will be another positive sign for the economy will also given the Federal Reserve comfort

wasn't you know what I mean it just didn't add up\nWell here we have Lewis thank you thank for the call we've got other anecdotal story but it dovetails with what we're seeing in the polling data\nWe're seeing the generic ballot advantages Democrats had now gone in the latest Maris NPR poll had a twelve point advantage is not two points which is statistically tied that's the margin of error or in in all these other generic ballot Paul's which I think er\n[noise] I don't think the Republicans have ever landed in one of the news and the Republicans winning Congress all the time so since Nineteen Ninety four anyway you people realize when the Republicans won in Ninety four was the first time in forty\nYears that they ran or control the house since then\nThey've lost control and won control back but I ... I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans\nI had I could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nBut now we're seeing voter enthusiasm shift\nTo the Republicans Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all his real at this polling data is accurate if it's the same stuff that Democrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us medium\nThey headline but this story conservative women are angry about cabinet law and they think other voters aren't to\nHere's a quote in the two weeks since the claims against capital of first emerged many feminist groups have\nCalled on senators in the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats entered from California captured the sediments when she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and I believe many Americans across the country believe\nYou what the writer of this story whose name is Anna Greene said\nThe women I interviewed however raises them ten the notion that people's accusations should be believed on the basis of their identity alone\nMakes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that's real in our culture a woman said women are not a monolithic blocked most of us are not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches\nThat said there's a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters\nThe conservative women living suburbs\nThe reason I ask that is because the Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban women\nWell\nThey may be losing that holds true if some of this polling data is correct let me just say this\nIf everything were just and it isn't and I know it\nBut if everything were saying the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now as they did back in two thousand two when they did the ... the Democrat Party\nIs in a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self immolation right now\nWith the treatment of Kavanaugh\nThe backing of a woman who's ... got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks to Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is that it's for the hold\nIf Trump had and went on his rant going on his ran on Monday Night the drive vice would've never reported that because they had not reported it\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the Senate that when the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\n\nBut the the behavior the Democrats have engaged in here\nThe public political murder about highly achieved brilliant guy\nWho never did anything that anybody anywhere near the way he's been described\n\nPeople bringing forth B. S. allegations like this wouldn't be as flies in the no evidence to back it up\nIn a same world would be paying a price so so high they wouldn't even engage in this kind of behavior but the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side and they think\n\nThat they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate rate Kavanaugh and hates conservatives and Republicans as a as well\nWhat we don't live in a saying world you know we don't live in a same country right now but uh it's still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge huge

[noise]\nI raise it a holy hell because they want to be able to link [noise]\nThey don't want to report how are we supposed to read that one report [noise]\nWell the reason there's only one copy of it is so that they can't get leaked this is a raw data about people folks\nWe have gone to great lengths to explain to you what this FBI report is it is a series of former three oh two\nIt's like the FBI version of other foreign ten forty three oh two is simply the results of an interview with people people of interest targets non targets neighbors passers by irritate or whatever the FBI goes in talks to people\nThey've done this about Kevin are now seven times\nOver the course of his judicial career and when he was in the White House staff secretary to George W. Bush he's carrying the nuclear college in what's called the football he's got to have the top level of security has got to be worthy of it they've done background after background after background on Capitol and they just did another one and they wouldn't talk\nTo specific witnesses\nA result of the claims by blocking the Ford and Ramirez they talk to mark judge for three hours they talked to revere as I talked to a bunch of people\nThey produce the results of those interviews they don't tell anybody they think they're lying they don't report their their opinions they don't come to conclusions they simply filed a three oh two is and they send them up to the Senate the White House the Senate gets one copy and you know why that is\nBecause all Baba\nAnd Patrick Leahy who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee back during one of the ah Obama terms agreed to this\nThe Democrats the Republicans and Obama agree that FBI reports like this\nIt's only one copy so that senators can't walk out with it and the leak it they're going to leak it any way that's already started to happen\nBut the and the Democrats know this this is this is another example of how they just simply why this is not being just disingenuous they're lying\nAnd they're trying to make it look like Trump and Grassley are trying to hide something and it's not it's law and his Senate law Senate rules\nAnd it is\nFascinating story how that happened which she attempts to explain in the book it's called Jesus has risen\nAnd it's about the birther Christianity using the book of acts it's all in the book ... I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament eat pistols as the introductory guide here\nAnd get people who want to read the Bible but they're intimidated by it to actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you're finished this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start and you'll be more likely to stay with it\n\nThe suffering and the ... the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and dissension of Jesus Christ which if the resurrection doesn't happen then Christianity\nDoesn't exist and and that's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that resurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really ... you really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died hey back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is\nA devoted to helping people believe that it's happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this it's it look it's it's not simply a primer it's its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible and to Christianity\nBoth testament but this focus is on the book of acts because that's where it all is now don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book at that's why they chose the book of acts to start this\nSo and I I again I I think you ever given me the time to mention as it would not be a timely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out there but again it's Jesus as residents just hit on Tuesday\nAnd it's a I think it's been hovering around Thirteen to Nineteen on Amazon on these busy doing all of his interviews with a book now and he's had a bunch of 'em schedule on Fox and he's been broom to because they can't leave the cabinet story\nSo I thought I Would do what I could hear to help make people aware that the book is out Jesus has risen by David Limbaugh and believe me I think it'll it'll I'm served its purpose if you have any interest at all and getting into this it'll\nIt'll give you an introductory how to do it where to go and not be intimidated by anybody back after this\nWas Russia's always
