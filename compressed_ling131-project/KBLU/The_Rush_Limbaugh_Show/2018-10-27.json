Republican surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risk\nFor pollsters now that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive by showing\nEverybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton to lead Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys couldn't miss late changes story written before the bombs\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats I don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what he's saying here you'd Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nA lot of people in our side of jumped St George Soros yeah maybe\nBut if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore Avon lady is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhat happened to you and say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think that going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now that argue is electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society\nStandard and good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned that yeah they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republican\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts or not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican to come up with it works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way shape or form a yup break time back with more after that sang\nOffice Russia's always at work but he I

I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that has just\nCommon knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I'd I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\n... absolutely look at you know we sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had her Wii Chuck Schumer is top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another and social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independence or an Republicans who are not too many and unfortunately that need to know every\nTime we have to put up an ad to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to help or to make sure Arizona's are aware of Arizona\nAre aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only got to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it'd be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than willing to unreal\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense\nOr fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea\nOf American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs where Americans we get to follow her own customs or else if you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly we we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me a years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values\nWere stood stood up for it yeah well I really wish I knew we both love and why they're president a new and here I'm a bit more than ... valley if\nYou're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention of course than cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country\nAh she's out one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was aligned with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group or that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best put plans for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in and the president needs to use all and\nIt gets to the border what's the best plan for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they are taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taken advantage of\nIt has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been down there many times\nThey redo yeah they're released into the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not ... it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing our border and the president as frustrated as the eye and he needs use everything he's got in to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually for building a wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bills thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell it's on I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my ... for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen of favorite counties which has no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now is resisting conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and toward something that gives more choice for people more flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate\nSo we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr I ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as the not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate it'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against a very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them Oh thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the position you take and uh you should win this race\nForeign why when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us more than ...\nThanks on appreciate you signing a flashlight on that and your advocacy and if people want to help they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations and we can win this thing thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you run\nA yes or a resolution on the show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the U.S Supreme Court listed as a person that\nThat actually are presented when he was ... was okay and the reason why my concern is is is because you're close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done a ... they want us to have transparency and so we've given transparency it's like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that\nAnd I saw the transparency and so we've given transparency it's like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever has not shop actually nominates they've already got a teen investigate and that's just a personal attack on a smear campaign", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh
