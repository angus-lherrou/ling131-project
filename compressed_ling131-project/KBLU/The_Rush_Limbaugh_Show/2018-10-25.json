so it's actually\nRan in the New York times they explain the reason for publishing the piece the New York times well\nOur focus here at the book review is our books and stories but also on how the books being written and ran reflect the world outside of books and one of the biggest stories out there of course is the mother investigation of the relationship between Trump and putting it's hard not speculative it's\nMade up\nTheir justifying a story on the assassination of Trump by a secret service agent based on the mother investigation\nI'm telling you these people are not right folks they are they're ... they are suffering psychological disorders that has been brought on by the on the reading lending hatred they feel over the outcome of the two thousand sixty an election they are out

bombs before we have the fact that is very very just preaching to us\nAbout civility when they are running stories and publishing excerpts from books fantasizing over to the ... majority of Donald Trump being assassinated is anybody find something seriously wrong with these people\nOther than me you know something's seriously mentally psychologically wrong here\nI mean it's one thing to run this another thing to not realize how plain and simple wrong it is and then to justify it based on the Mueller investigation\nWell there's a lot of interest out there Mr Limbaugh Muller is looking into the ties between Portland then Trump there aren't any ties between Hillary important there aren't any ties you haven't found any there never were any they were known to be found there wasn't any

the same day\nThey're wringing their hands to ... did in ... so many bombs had been sent to Trump\nTarget anyway Trump is right on the money with his tweet about the media being culpable and I'll tell you don't misunderstand you know I'm a big self responsibility person I Am so into it\nThat I don't ask for help enough folks I really don't I I've\nI've been told by number but you know you could really is some stress if you ask for help I I I look at everything as as an especially things I Want things I Need I look at all is totally my responsibility\nAnd maybe too much I don't know\nBut I firmly believe in it and so therefore whoever did this is the ultimate\nResponsible person no question about it but I'm not going to sit here\nAnd time my hands behind my back and the other half of my

trying to get us to shut up\nIn response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here and said oh no no no until we know the facts but can't comment while they comment left and right and start

tweet\nTrump talked about the bombs center former public officials in his rally in Wisconsin but once again he didn't mention CNN on top of all that he criticized the media coverage he doesn't like

responsibility for your rhetoric in constantly calling my family racist and Nazis for two years when my wife actually opened and exploding on below the white powder intended for me what about when it happened to my brother and Jimmy\nYou know you guys claim everybody else has to accept responsibility for their rhetoric but you don't want to have any responsibility for your rhetoric or your

time caller actually\nThank you I like to have you back with us and sorry it's great to have you back with us here\nOh thank you very much I'm Wilson my husband and I were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points to make that kind of illustrate\nWhy we think these packages weren't actually males um it he's their commonsense questions and the first one to me is how likely is it that someone could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd haven't shown what miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and if I say I possibly the vaccine time that that's not that's not common sense I mean I used to see how that could\nJust say the deniro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the\nDay before truth CNN got their Clinton so forth\nI there was a ... throw the whole group of us in that they have like four or five of them shows up all of that same thought well how do you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller mentioned what I was going to one of the Congress adults can make the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it um the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nSo you're obviously not taking them again and paying for them you know having them late and paid in profits properly um your you have to stick the post office box right will post office box and don't even have enough room to flipping oversized package into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of them actually did show up at the residents so\nYou're going to think that\nWill get what what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting hampered\n... I think that I'm Sorry that I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for the well this is the Cuban looking packages cheesy it's a joke I mean it looks like a joke even if I can see that there's something in there and if you look at the very address too don't you think that after going through it\nIt was a it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll take it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts Nextel officer\nHigh rush hour radio I'm good\nGood good I just wanted to go up you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but individual also get more than any other nation and the point is is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right how my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government do it they're telling on who they are going to\nBasically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give a choice and that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a ringing his hands in guilt\nOver the facts of caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it and it because we're not in it but could be in it except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that were just plain lucky it's kinda like Clinton Richard Gephardt the winters of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and we got conceived in a woman in America and we've got born into America and and man that's that's so much like that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special or so the fact that we weren't conceived and warms down in Nicaragua in Guatemala means that\nWe all we really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk\nIn the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like\nTo be poor that's why so many people strive not to be governor it is it hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nAnd lose at all there are people that\nAre in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble every time I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then the run around and feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around\nConstantly imagining well you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that care a man and then having that\nImpact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism never sounds anything\nLiberalism as a gutless\nChoice because should never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're seeing and how it makes you so one comfortable to someone here look at the suffering and the starvation its citizens\nAnd you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say\nThat you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it\nAnd that's liberalism solutions\nAre wherever the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they haven't been happening in the United states the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before we go to the break I just want to remind all of you again for those who are just joining us or maybe we're not here in

swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked is now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just
