trouble than I Am he had his information was the first time I've seen this on a show\nThe first time I've heard someone call in and say their information was sold on the dark Web\nWas sold crunches ISP had given him a warning that they had seen some sort of a breach\nAnd that large amounts of data was being downloaded away from him um when they were not home like fifty gigs at a at a chunk wow then who's the security company that he's with contacted him and said that his email and possibly as password were sold on the dark Web\nWell I'm sure it wasn't just as email probably right I mean that's all they were able to probably to tech he also said that he was part of the target breach and the Equifax breach this can be part of the Yahoo 'cause we're talking about that and just to go and find out [laughter] oh my gosh poor guy\nYou know ... and ... did you win the one point six billion dollars this past week Barry come on\nYou know I did not and did you play no I Do not um I played\nI

South Carolina [laughter] that's true so use uh so you've not had a good time or the last couple of months huh\n[noise] well it's all happened just for you in the last month when all this information came to me\nI see okay and so and so you're so the information that that they told you just said to Andrew is that that your router was compromised and your Gmail account was compromise is that what I heard\nThe to what they believe is okay and then what steps have you taken since\nEveryone said the same thing that I needed to immediately change passwords and make them complex\nOn the router and also the change passwords on my email and anything that my email is used for to get into in a kennel Mm So for instance a bank account if I sign up with my email I should change the password correct so I've done all of that\nOkay and now you're wondering what else can you do wow\nI'm Wondering about like is there such a thing as an ... rich and poor\nOh or some sort of a bumble that you could buy the monitors things\nUh it just seems like the alternative is to call it a different programs are apps in place like Miller bites an anti virus and password manager and so forth and I'm looking for something more comprehensive and this is serious business here [noise]\nUm this is all of our data and I'm concerned about maybe some a professional type of protection\nI see okay and you know what and rightfully so I mean because you know it's it's once you get your data compromises you feel so vulnerable don't you I mean it's like ... or you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you that this information is being downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe your computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\nNever heard a ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge ah so\n... more than once and you feel yeah so that's what I was thinking that maybe a because what\nSometimes with the the hackers do is that they find vulnerable computer and they house files are there\nAnd then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer\nOr so that this way they're not liable or you know they they it's harder for them to be tracked okay to be tracked down\nA so I Would definitely go through and look at data usage on any type of gadget that was connected to it you know with the route or like you said like you know you give it a good a password and you can also do Mac addressing have you looked at into that\nYou know get media access control or what that means is that the\nOnly devices that are going to have access to your router of those devices that you permission okay\nAnd and so I Would definitely turn that on for Mac addressing\nA you also want to make sure that the DNS servers have has not said that they have not been changed as well uh and you can get into your router and also your ... to do that turn on the Mac fire walls also with your Google Account you want to do a security
