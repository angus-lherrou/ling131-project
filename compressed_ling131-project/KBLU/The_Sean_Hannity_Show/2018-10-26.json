our and our our marriage\nWell Diana CNN guy today John McLaughlin John outlawed I I actually go out there and say um that deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro\nOne of the things that I found was on October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting De Niro\nBut things he said on Alec Baldwin show of all places and said that the Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of\nRobert De Niro and the things that he said why been critical\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's\n... he's a dog he's a pig he's a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care pictures gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has\nI'd like to punch him in the face\nThis is a solution not\nVoted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate here this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is that you know I support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown that in fact on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get on the assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny kind of come to the district to help him get elected but you know who came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had a son Eric I'm there and his daughter of bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mum having you on those and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in\nNorthern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district\nSo you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money I've been talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping introduce racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous and me and my opponent star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even an upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping her small business community\nAre small business humidity is about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that just didn't help just live by Nancy Pelosi\nThat somehow the wealthiest said the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the recent Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts is because his Ross owners want to leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get\nThere actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters and for them to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote out its most important we can beat the wall money but we need a Republican voters to understanding each ticket out oh it's really really important\nRight a quality attorney or running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com\n... the main you know ground zero seeds that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves that we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct to re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any\nEither Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you I had a lot and I have not been in\nClinical sense whatsoever but these terms are I'm leaving me in court to get out and about a ... and you hit on it every day I listen to a and not watch it or not I I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do this for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important you vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home I have a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve I've been at this gave him a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media you know I see three scenarios that could unfold but I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full\nObjective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nPeople identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi\nAn Adam Schiff Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not gonna cry we're not going to be cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's gonna happen we\nKnow they only want Obama Care we do they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states we know they want their crumbs back you know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nYou know or we can win at all or we could lose it all listen all of us\nOn the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity or you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feel spell my best your best and when I Love even more is the fact you know what I I I hate going to stores I really do especially ... by a razor and
