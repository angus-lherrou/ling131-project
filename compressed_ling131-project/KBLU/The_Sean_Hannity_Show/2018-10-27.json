Tennessee are ignorant and they had no problem saying yeah he's only saying that he's voting for cabinet he would never vote for Kavanaugh\nHe's just saying that to get elected then he'll get there he'll be is a liberal and they will do the right thing\nWe had a similar situation in Missouri with Claire McCaskill directly or own words and she's ... she is as liberal as Brock Obama but she's

struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is has to walk away from the Democratic party a he joins us as well as post Paterson who memory he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl ... dereliction of duty a welcome both W brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left or a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be our son thank you um so you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider\nSo it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I considered myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself I was a Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was\nOne of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big it and ... and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no\nBetter and you know they I think that the liberal media did for me as they did for millions of others are very effective job\nScaring people really making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked reporters disability and\nIt was on that day in January of two thousand and Seventeen but somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life and I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that narrative it had nothing to do with news or the truth\nBrand that let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you asking solvent I experienced as myself and it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this what when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or\nOr an older person or women you know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that republic\nThis massage in is that there are homophobic Dina phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words that they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look look at the statistics for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seeing\nSo how many people have joined your movement so the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand or ... or something like ... yeah all social media platforms\nWe have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary cui we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and then when you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I I was blessed and senator or are you\nWhat's going on man 'cause I'm I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't know it was not affect him I said if you like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting in a way\nYeah well you know my story Shaun I I went up to the White House or as the air force\nBlacks lake you know light and actually the nuclear football for President Bill Clinton for two years after I lost that position you'd I Love the White House office of the bedroom and travel with the Internet\nOr wherever they were ... world and after I left that night I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite that the transformation that Brandon is but I I went in as a military officer proud to serve less sensitive\nIssues altogether and election of ... and then ... and then I hooked up on social media so I mean I'm going to be at age ... could be a great time of expecting thousands and thousands of people to be walking away instrument testimonials and I can't wait I mean it's gonna be fun and it's also going to be asking him to send a signal to the rest of the country that Democratic Party stands\nFor nothing get substantial that they they ... they fetish\nA license ban and talked about getting mainstream media status lies thank God for you shot and what you do um but it's time for people to wake up whether you know I'll tell\nYou one thing I don't like being in line about um you know he's like twenty so I I don't I'm not a racist than I Do want to be called one

Washington Post is he is\nHe or does he have a point of view that Washington happens to like\nAbout a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and established global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards the Jews their biggest and most effective tool and harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... or\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration you cannot call them a largely secular organization when you read\nJust their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model the current our constitution jihad our plan and death for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes they're not primarily\nThe Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of death and they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die you know believe God gives proud life in this world\nOkay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy\nEnter the Arab Spring\nThe Arab Spring praise by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there yet materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood\nDid they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both ... chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism\nAs a as a means to their

this kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all it's a Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth editing at editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hospitals that about ... hobby is them or the king\nDuring this time he ... up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals\nWhen he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobby is movement\nWhy did he do that\n... because he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the hobbyists\nThe shah geared to show he was cast aside and that's\nIn love with him an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring he got out\nHe came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressive the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy by turning it against itself\nHe wants wanted to establish sharia law in the region\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote this man wrote that he it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam is this\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam Islamic ... believes you have to use your real law\nThat the constant wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood turkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people\nSaudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states\nTrue they kill him could be probably seems like it I don't trust

that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history and it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for that so the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a farm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody at job choice\nOr more McKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nSo there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global war the fake\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the ... community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming\nAnd the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious act or you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs ... these are to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more ... you had to get people around people number\nOne is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take the Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL\nMost of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strata\nVideo will appear it'll be fake but video well up here and it will be Kavanaugh party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write that the ah why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposure for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or that\nPerson is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of nuts pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but\nThat's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a ban and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor them that good to be with your line but\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you're really want to get into him on taking on your own\nSide how do we feel if we're taking on our own side I Hope that he will come down and uh\nWeight she just said it at one point [laughter] oh I mean first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not\nOr so and it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding an end it at our founding but we but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... which we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people\nCome out and make their arguments and we have to make ours back that does not mean I'm In a minute diplomacy thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... written a reaction from conservative\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a heap\nOf support from conservatives\nThe actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner but\nI didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat\nAnd you know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront hate face to face right and that you can there's nothing on the left\nThere or even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we are divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with the ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group it's a small room he's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where\nI think he's wrong is ignore it\nIs it part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members that have been having forever the comeback forever up about ... members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nThat's not what we have now we have NASA FAA breaking laws you can't ignore the can and can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ...\nNot what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore them that came in and you can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore the excess\nWould argue nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\n[noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just to miss a group like ads for though that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti though and I think that has been generalize argument he was going well\nThe the the key here is what do you do about it and the\nSolution is to not to do what people did in Florida\nWith Nancy Pelosi you don't do that because that doesn't give you\nDecide to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's\nJust when you talk to a gabbing about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like what Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like whether they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because of the press treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said you\nKnow what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that but\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and I'm like okay I don't\nWe can't we can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengage then it just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principles\nYeah I mean we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left\nYou know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing morning first time caller longtime listener I all during the day very good\nOh right yeah and you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said\nA victory all on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot at the end up and just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes every one of us\nTo each other mhm anymore it's just that our God now that being said\nEvery one that I Know an independent in the state of horror will be showing up toward the conservative Muslim November\nReally and I yeah well you know that you\nSent home or eat them you got people in the office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more I got my first uncommon in eight\n[laughter] yeah I mean yeah\n... ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian show you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they ... themselves into a restaurant it can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nMost depend and then think exactly the way I Do it just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as extra concern I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are a ... then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close that levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between the two that if\nThe independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew [noise] Glenn\nWeekdays at noon eastern this has been in a republic with free markets the blaze welcome to see the show we have a record of him screwing us\nSo many times before this moment principle conservatism just needs to be grounds for an ethical ... perhaps serve daily you can always count on Republicans to try and do whatever it takes to preemptively cave on every significant find the CDC dot com food as strong\nWeekdays noon eastern on the blaze [noise]\nFive sixty gene B L U um\n\n\nIf you experienced pain on a daily basis I Know exactly how you feel it can be debilitating it can control your life\nThe aches are easy to understand when it really hurts to do the basic chores emotionally the effects of pain
