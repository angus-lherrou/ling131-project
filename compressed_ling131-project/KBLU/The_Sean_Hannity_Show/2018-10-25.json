Sebastian Gorka just mentioned a skull east\nNobody mentioned skull lease yesterday an attempted assassination of the United states congressmen on that Virginia ball fields nobody's talked about that you\nKnow what I don't know that they don't ... I mean\nThe only reason those guys are alive today and this goes to something I Know is near and dear to your heart is because you had to Capitol police officers that did what probably their training told them not to do and that is they walk in an open field with pistols\nGoing up against a rifle a and a guy hidden behind a barrier now that basically is is is a suicide mission to save someone else's life that's how brain don't even watch\nOr listen to these men and women do it all the time it's just like the men and women to just be a joint terrorism task force now\nOr the FBI the New York city police this New York state police or they're going to go out there a risk their lives to five person responsible for these devices now I I Want to preface that if the devices are real\nI I don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a a real inkling that\nThese may not be real devices I'm ... and if that's true um were a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious that you've had eight or nine of these things so far in usually the trigger mechanism for these devices is the actual opening of the package\nWhile there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me there is some sort of problem so I'm hoping they're not real um and I hope and the the authorities find them sooner than later I think\nThe ... we had to go search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely I said yesterday you'll have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that there's an ... month some\nEnormous amount of evidence that they've been able to capture because these things did not detonate and I think we'll see something so\nAll right Dr Gordon we give you the last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released the plot how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the normalization of violence\nAs started on the left when you have an a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're gonna be civil off the we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's a left responsible if you put the normalization of vitamins\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin vote with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it town so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nFor him I Do not have well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have used his vote healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nThe getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state Sean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and mansion said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters Manchin says no and even on Kavanaugh where people say oh well he ended up voting for Kavanaugh\nReality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs so so ah you know I kind of view a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you don't vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is\nIs that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader and I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and wish I would say on important issues like tax cuts\nRegulation energy those are three main fundamental issues\nThat that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places and struggled with a ... opioid issues and we'd have a with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that\nJoe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out the obstruction\nResistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock destroying the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on\nJoe mansions first vote because the you know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team\nThat's tearing down the president\nWest Virginians don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia sick to try and keep it otherwise how much is Schumer in company and below sea in company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I think by a ... by all accounts they're going to probably be up over\nTwenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final ...\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve to tens of eight six to or\nTo to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen lives are early voting began and when her junior as it started yeah early\nYeah early voting started yesterday and so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate to really be at stake\nWhat this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey but we're going to out work Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest watts\nThere when you need them All right we're watching this race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leading Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help a future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Marcy\nHey Shaun thanks so much for anyone interested in learning about or as you know where

the real Haiti has\nBeen coming from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's a selective moral outrage being about Russia or being about sexual assault or the allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric for actions I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House\nAnd I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHaitian you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listen to a clip that you just played and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we have to be ... about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the I ask you one question and ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of fake news CNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word\nMob well because that's a talking point for the whole point it's reality you know when you know you don't have those those are mobs going after those people I Do\nNot going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mom to be able to eat in Sinai looks like a month to me\nI also think that presents unique talent police officers in Long Island to rough up ... when I get in the back at a paddy wagon you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nWe all don't respect I don't see that I see a media that has\nBeen corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\n[noise] well I'll tell you one thing uh I I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob a mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case\nThese people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nAnd when I look at the at the response which you had and which are seeing from other people are when bronco bomber was an office um\nThe um the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders but\nWhat you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan\nTo put the things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized and now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so\nDisgusting to lead a low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and ask 'em was this\nRhetoric prepared it's a it's a very alarming thing was that I got Daniel\n[noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's today I think that there is plain state line across the entire political spectrum and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and said well I deal with people who don't necessarily agree when I get my job's done I said I I ... hot and somehow I managed to get around the world around this country to get around my city\nI without inflaming tensions that the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done without the kind of planets weigh rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton drew in through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels and you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host\nPart of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've vetted Obama when no one else would we ... the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do well like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices delivered to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the uh down below where they have the headline or below the reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this other automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political\nUm this tasteful rhetoric that when you couple that with the things like Madonna said with the things that are these politicians are are\nAnd carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words are so uh inflame it's not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and\nPump it up to something that he never made it to be\nWe're gonna have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum author of sheep no more thank you Danielle McLaughlin attorney\nA and a soon to be a mom for I Believe
