I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is orange intimate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him\nBut in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says what other information do you have that's legitimate question because\nThere is none and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have could have it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no corroborating evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I I think I think people are emotional for for ...\n\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a\nMedia hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their playbook I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say\nIf you're going to make the girl is accusations against individuals you better be able to prove it\nBecause if you can't prove it then you ought to be held financially liable because re Donovan once famously said where do I go to get my good name back after he was run through the ringer in the Reagan years I don't know how you get your good name back you know I I Know Clarence Thomas I've met Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas\nHuman being I've had I've met in my life you read his book my grandfather's son than you are going to be done that the life lessons you can learn from that book\nWhat he went through it still comes up twenty five years later and I would say there's two things we need to change legally in the country we're going to have tort reform of any kind loser pays you want to sue and you'll lose you got to pay for the trial and the second is I think slander laws in the country\nNeeds to be adjusted as well you cannot just say anything about a public figure and the bar is so high that you actually have to get into somebody's mind to prove\nThat they didn't have any malice whatsoever that it's an impossible standard to ever meet and I'm not even saying look I expected in my life my career it happens all the time but um I signed up for this I dish it out four hours a day but I don't think Brett Kavanaugh signed up for this when he agreed to\nAccept the president's prestigious nomination to the U.S Supreme Court not this\nNot what his kids have gone through now with his family have gone through anyway Brandon thank you appreciate it a eight hundred nine for one Sean toll free telephone number ... uh Michelle was in North Carolina next Michelle happy Thursday glad you're with us welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nThinking shot at all they can continue on I wanted to say I absolutely agree with you I think something wanted that are there either lighter so desperate that we all those red eye and then very ... because the Democrats had systematically raped\nAll over the checks and balances the trends that tree branches of government they are now the thing that you ... ...

I Believe that\nThe man has spent his entire life wanting to be a judge and get everything that he needed to do to get to that tradition and he is also like you said on multiple occasions the justice system flock to itself it\nIs intended to protect the innocent and instead what we're seeing if he is absolutely being attacked by them very laws that she has spent his life upholding which is you\nKnow the that defendants does not have to prove their innocence is on the prosecution to prove someone's guilt and they're completely flipping the tide and we cannot\nSue for a second Michelle that he gets on the Supreme Court\nAfter going through this experience and he's a judge and\nNow he more than anybody I think it's going to have a heightened sensitivity to the idea of the presumption of innocence right I I Wonder in many in a weird way God works in mysterious ways\nThat he may not become one of our best justices ever based on this process and based on what has happened to him and his own life experience with this\n[noise] absolutely I completely agree I mean especially once you've been through the system and you can understand how it feels to be treated when you're innocent um you know end up against it and I mean he in the highest level in the land that somebody that they get\nPulled over on the side of a road you know he's being treated by police officers had many hits a light in the highest levels and did you just system with all of these you know it's the highest\nSecurity clearance that is available to somebody that's not the president United\nMichelle here the coach toward nuclear weapons or Eighteen days ago you had an impeccable reputation as character was never put in question Eighteen days ago boy is is like changed boy is his kids life changed his wife's life changed\nIt was hard watching his wife behind him you know crying as he's crying as he's talking about is ten year old daughter saying that no we ought to pray for professor Ford um I Know I wasn't that good a ten year old that sounds like a pretty special to me\nAbsolutely and we all need to be praying because this is I don't believe that this is just against Republicans and Democrats there's a spiritual more going on here and I'm sure it is learning\nA tiny or lie is Michelle I Hope you're out there in North Carolina matters a eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program\nMary is in Brooklyn New York the all new am seven ten W a war of the talk of New York New Jersey and Long Island what's going on a Mary how are you\nOh I'm good Hi Shaun how are you I'm good thank you\nI you know I have a lot of different questions I actually live on Long Island don't want them at one of the things that I've taken notes or it's how the liberal media completely distorts the facts and puts it out and unless you do due diligence or pay attention and Fox News um used totally miss what reality is I mean you have to\nAnd unless you just do feel a chance or pay attention and Fox News um you've totally missed\nWhat reality is I mean you have to go like from the Senate Judiciary committee review their timeline of investigation to show what they actually investigated before they even had this sevens FBI investigation you have to like\nBecause if you just pay attention and the liberal media you would think they did it get nothing that that that that didn't even\nGet Brett Kavanaugh that and instead they they vetted him so many different times at this point and now once now that's coming out that they have nothing more fully completely um the allegations are totally\nOn on substantiated and yet now they're going into the fact that are we trying some school and like you said they said oh it's true I said somebody\nThrough ice cubes at a bar in college I'm like oh man\nAnyway thanks for the call appreciate it I Want to remind you of the best coffee you will ever have in your life life black rifle coffee dot com slash Hannity look we've all been there we've been to these", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Yuma", "day": "04"}
