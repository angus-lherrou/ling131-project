like that and we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible but we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground show what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ... a testimony which wasn't even you know significant and uh they're they they just believe that because of the health they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd this is one of the things are so disturbing about this the obviously the me too concept is really really important and early ... important like it it really it it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is\nHere's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's lives which is an awful outcome where what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion\nIs that going forward or people like Phyllis\nWould it would be believed would at least be taken seriously not paying you've taken seriously just they have the evidence taken seriously and ... and then would not fear coming out because if you had\nA evidence and you had a a real story to tell it would be believed

you\nKnow fill us as you said you knew that the anger wasn't going to get you anywhere in life so you had to deal with it\nIf you deal with the is the situation um you have a chance to grow it is much

that I shall never say the things I Do not believe\nThings are not as bad as you think they are are they are bad but this is a bad this is a pivot point for our country and if we fall down on our job it will change and it will go away and I think it will become very bad however\nIt's not the battle but you think it is you've been convinced by media and social media that everybody is thinking this way there not\nWait a minute what\nDavid talk about a few of the millennials that we have had in for our two week you know training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile sense right yeah we have a number of Columbus skeptics here to disapprove of ... that were all wrong and\nIt's All right you know we don't we don't run from that situation which is raised them and say let's have a conversation as long as ... right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and it's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so once you ask the questions that lead them to the information\nIt's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions he got all the photo because he didn't know the answers\nHe now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned and all these classes it's amazing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an F\nThis is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources and she had him nailed down and so she had never here's a professor ... didn't know this stuff\nAnd economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then shut them the documentation\nAnd he said okay I I Want more because I clearly did not but that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys that come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them I'm quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm I Love language if we don't make fun of you is because we don't like it just so so you know we we we kid and joke and they have a great great time\nBut they come out transformed and there are some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good it is just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've notes this formally uh may I David go for it um we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February\nIf you don't think that's\nA little controversial um but we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides\nUh and it's black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows let's tell the black history that really nobody knows\nUh and that's going to be here at our studios in the month of February and yesterday we decided that because they're ... they're going to we're going to have do since we're gonna have people that are going to tell these individual stories about these people in the here on stage Nineteen as you come through and they're all going\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nYeah Ben Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans are moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German their truck started to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain because he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nGift simulation I mean ... ... Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in their early youth these old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation\nWill infused into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted mass\nHe says the solution is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this it seems to me necessary this Franklin seems to be necessary to distribute the um German there's the Germans a more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now\nThe Germans the Germans a more equally mixed in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick we settled I Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for galaxy blah blah blah they're great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing no Dearborn\nMichigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them reading a parallel culture where there's almost a no go zone out for for police Somalians in in um Minnesota exactly and we got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation\nYou want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move it to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever\nOne way to lose it is is to not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we know we're not into government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top now\nYou say that racial healing is fairly easy all we have to do is do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know that there are several things one is you've got to change the some of your knowledge base as to what we find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor said\nAnd we showed them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't their historical but remember all stuffy and what those are oh yeah there are several things of this the first permanent ... is permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... on other black men\nAre we showed the fact that a forty three percent a free blacks in South Carolina on black slaves\nThat wow one out of yeah nearly half\nA one out of eight a Native Americans own black slaves and major tribes\nAnd that didn't stop that and even though they masturbation proclamation winded slavery\n... didn't stop with Thirteen to ... when we abolished slavery because we only about slavery in the United states but Indian nations are their own nations ... when they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later before slavery stopped in Indian nations\nSo what we do show slavery is a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professors say\nIt has a problem and the way you view humankind\nSo we go through and and show for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with this thing where you invite other people from other races to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning and touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one person at a time change in the heart of the time seeing people different\nAnd not having this black white polarization that we often try to make today\nHow worried are you David about the level of anger now\n[noise] level of anger is a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these\nThings where we really don't know each other and once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials unlike with folks of other races and other groups once you start to an individual stuff that's where it breaks down\nAnd that's where you're able to demonstrate that you know what you thought about me or what you thought about this group is not accurate where individuals were made in God's image we have equality and we can get along great if we'll sit down and talk to what you're doing to your book Glen I'm an addict it outraged ... that's exactly it you you sit down and have conversations on bigger things\nSo real quick just one last give me the six things\nYou say are these are the six or ...\n... they're actually six searching areas what we've got to do an immigration\nFix things that you say are these are the six urgent steps\nThat they're actually six urging areas what we've got to do an immigration what we have to do in our relationship with Israel what we have to do with millennials what we have to do with the people of faith doing a terrible job right now is when people of faith or so we go through those six areas and let me lose\nTouch on Israel our relationship with Israel is pretty good ideas are now your concern in the book about Christians are starting to become anti\nSemitic their become an anti Semitic what has changed just last well we don't know the scriptures well anymore and that we have the highest level of biblical literacy of any generation American history\nAnd so we're ah we're seeing sixteen hundred anti Israel events a year on college campuses uh people don't know much about the Palestinians but they're told they're oppressed people in Israel is doing it\nSo we have a real individual turn against Israel and a lot of denominations are coming out against Israel the nomination as it used to be very pro Israel now you're only yes absolutely absolutely\nYeah these are the more liberal churches though their ... their water called mainstream the nomination so that that you know just kind of like the United Methodist Church yeah usa those\nSo they had never been anti Israel before but now they are they're they're coming out and they want to do the ... kind of stuff to boycott the best ensure and sanctions so there is a growing anti Semitic movement among people of faith in America which is certainly a problem\nNow this administration is an ... job on restoring science is just as if an absolutely amazed yeah\nBut that doesn't solve the individual problems we have a college campuses and at churches and people say\nDavid Barton and James ... of the name of the book is this precarious moment six urgent steps that will save you your family\nAnd our country we are at the edge of the cliff and as a
