it go away\nWhy yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and it's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit make it and just not flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter it's an actual texture within the drywall itself almost like a ...\nWhile I'd rather not go that route as the the the ...\nUm I'd like to add texture the paint just to get the wall something other than the mood drywall\nWell there's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you sort of dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and a lot that dry and then\nPut a coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you could do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian class\nAnd put a thinner coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you can do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing at and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's this waited texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the paint that makes that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rub softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual stand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back into the nice texture to they all have different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it because some of those textures or\nYou know kind of labor intensive forward the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I Will look into a a things you suggested here and make a

right away and then they started making deliveries animal now they are ramping up delivers the deliveries and actually\nThe biggest thing I hear from people whenever I hear Tesla mentioned even if I'm not in the conversation I listen to him talk and say well they're just going to go bankrupt one day they keep losing all this money and lose and all this money and I don't know what the\nWhole deal behind the story is all I Know is that the guy that owns that company has a ton of money and I see a lot of business owners when they build a business it costs them money to get the business going and then once they get going they're ready to make a profit because they've put all that money into building and even if they lose money to get started a lot of them do it\nWell Tesla as of the quarter three of this year\nUh turned a profit of three hundred and twelve million dollars they've ramped up production on the model three and they're making a twenty percent profit per model three sold right now and they even had such a demand on it they're delivering enough that they raise the price of the car a thousand bucks so\nI'm pretty cool am there uh it says they have a a stockpile of three

look at that diagram\nOn the Internet and see what's going on that will that's where we're here to educate you to ... you know our listeners to help them because if somebody says no this tires not ... but you know because he looked it up that it is go to another shop and then explain to that shot\nHey uh this here I understand we can't pass on the edge but that's\nNot on the edge what do you think and you know the shop the it's up to them and the final decision but still if you know you're one step further to\nPreventing a a you know that that help you out there ...\nThere's been a really really awful because I Do I like being a professional is jury I had no idea that certain areas are fictional surgeries or fiction so that's really made me understand the situation better ... appreciate it\nYou bet and they're just on lucky sometimes the they may puncture something right through a belt\nHad an elderly gentleman come in this\nMy first thought was this guy's getting scanned because he said the the shop I just came from told me I had three tires that we're not ... but my tires were only six months old and he says I Can't really believe that but if they need to be replaced whatever so he was coming in for new tires\nAnd we looked at the ... will check and find out in our guy looked and he says well that was not repair all had a screw right in the side will write right through it\nAnd the other two were within a quarter inch of the far outside edge like how does somebody pick up the guy said he drives through a lot of construction areas with houses and stuff that are being built so well that can happen but none of the tires had a puncture\nThe actual flat part of the tread they were all ... of the tire that's about as unlucky is you can and they were new tires to they were they were really there about six\nMy thing is sad so you can't do anything [laughter] [laughter] it's just what I can see where you don't really that will knock on wood you haven't had a flat line I had to have your talking why don't you why would you bring that are so so you haven't had one of the field goal all year [laughter]\nAn ethics five nine for for one five oh\nHi this is Steve I have a two thousand four hung up ... I was on my way to work no matter like came on and my battery went dead\nI tested the battery in charging system with the old battery in it what you read anything on the charging system but in the battery with that I replaced the battery testing to charge a system with my chest and that's a system that's good\nThe battery is good but the battery laid on the ... still on any suggestions\nAnd you're going to need to read scanned the vehicle and see if there are any codes in there because they they do have most of the cars may now we'll have charging systems that are\nPretty complicated as far as their metered by the engine computers sometimes the body computer a lot of them have a charging censor on one of the\nHigh current wires to the battery and all those things work together and they can set codes when there's a problem and even though you fixed it if there was a code and there may still be keeping the light on\nAlso um the it may have a a failure in one of those circuits maybe charging but it may have a bad charge censor there's a lot of\nThere's a lot more involved than it used to be when you just had a field wire a power wire a grown wire state or wire and you just you could see the entire system now it's feeding back through like rush said the computer there sensors involved\nOr sometimes the voltage regulator might be actually in the computer on the vehicle we had that just recently uh a question that came from a\nI think it was a listener down in Florida\nIt was looking to buy some parts and uh so we we just have to be very aware that these systems have got to be so much more intricate\nThan they once were ... they're trying to keep the voltage ... smooth steady state no different than you do for your home computer system right you you put on interrupted power supply in front of your computer to keep everything smoothed keep the power clean\nThey have to do the same thing for this vehicle because you're running an onboard computer network throughout the vehicle controlling multiple systems and if the power is not right it's not going to work rate\nSo other than checking the code to find out I mean is there is there anything that he can do without bringing an end is there any only gives you in times there will check it out and actions\nAnd yes I have some cars coming amazing how many Coca Cola into their tooth thirties loose tooth brush to clean up the ... yeah but there there's a lot of stuff that's this loose we have a car come in and see I've worked in all this stuff and it doesn't work and they just give me this look when I say oh well this wasn't plugged in and I plug it in [laughter] we're going to go\nOr serious [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nAnd sometimes I feel really bad for them\nManifold on the whole bit they've got all the coils and spark plugs in you forgot to plug the oil in no way you know\nI have seen that so many times where people have on their own ... listening to us we're trying to help you here we're trying to help you from yourself [laughter]\nIf it because I I'm this guy I have done it with a washing machine I've done it with her fridge reader you assume you know what's wrong and you come at the large operation\nYour gear up vigorous learn about ration your purchased parts for this large operation you spent half of a weekend day on this large operation you put it back together and it does exactly the same thing is that not frustrating and super fun and then you find out it was\nThe door sensor on the door and you just replace the top I mean on the washing machine whatever happened to be I mean it's just these are the types of things that people do all the time on cars where they they make this decision that All right I've got\nI've got a bad intake gasket mhm I've got to have a bad in the gas\nI had a guy replace a transfer case shift motor on a Chevy Truck\nHe replaced the four wheel drive shift monetarily replaced the switch and then he replaces the transfer case because the the transfer case would not go into four wheel drive load he just absolutely had to have that for Boehner's vote on the water and he came in he says I've done all this stuff I Can't figure out what's going on I said well what do you do and he goes well see I pushed it and it doesn't do anything just flashes\nI step on the brake put a neutral hit the button and it shifted and he says well\nHow did you do that so we got to have a neutral and step in the break oh he's trying to go to for low and he says no you know I said yes you do we know you don't\nYes you do what do you recall\nHe could have started with the owner's manual ordering down his son vice president\nNeed anything it was working perfectly at age six five four four one five oh let's talk to Mike in Idaho Mike you're on the end of the who'd show what can we do for ya\nI ah haven't two thousand three Corvette and about a thousand miles to go out with a new Alternator on it and they set the battery was about fourteen months old\nAnd it was good\nAnd now it's sitting in my garage up north here in Idaho\nAnd draining the batteries just grainy how quickly it could end\nUp how quickly or maybe three hours I wouldn't be out driving around and I can watch the whole Mader go for fourteen point one Thirteen points seven years old so I don't even want to shut it off anymore and so overnight in my garage I have to charge it\nSort of going on down while you're right that\nYeah even while I'm driving so there was a draw somewhere and I'm just curious what's the trick\nTo it if you had if you had a a just a standard let's say you know nine PM Alternator or a hundred probably just over three hundred and fifty ... well yeah my ... you gotta you gotta standards they a hundred and thirty ample later on they're\nCharging at full capacity if it was a good Alternator and it was actually losing current as it was driving to being driven\nSomething would be on fire and then [laughter] it would have to be that big of a of a of a short seriously I mean it would have to be like the starter on and running continuously\nLook hold on the right there Mike stay where we are yeah there's more ... Mike from Idaho as a two thousand three quarter back we're going to get to his problem when we come back on the under the hood show\nMike thanks very much for the call good luck is is it worse being stranded on the side of a road in a Corvette than in like a ...\nIt's more embarrassing yeah I think so they're like right people look at you and go look at ... curl up in\nThe back seat of the precinct leaders could just say I'm done for the day I take a nap [laughter] eight six six\nFive nine for for one five oh let's talk to Iran Roger you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nYeah I have a two thousand four vehicles save Ruth ... thirty eight hundred engine and the plastic\nTo come out of the manifold\nGo through the patch or are are bad so I'm gonna replace them\nAnd I'm just wondering I have two related question as long as they got the part that far as a hundred and forty thousand miles on it today to replace the water pop at the same time and if I Do what did he do you feel it on the ...\nI'd be more concerned about the into gas gets in the water pump but you know at this age we do put water pumps on those cars we put one on this week and it at least so long that killed the ah had guests gets on the car\nBecause it was all living they like it hot too many times running out of coon yeah and that doesn't help that their gauge and their dash has been broken for but then the gas is they are definitely in our in our especially in our northern climate they are the\nBigger culprit of problems in a water pump go from ten below zero to two hundred degrees and back and forth so many times that the expansion contraction but those those cooling bypass too you're talking about those things right out all the time very popular item\nWater pump if you're if you're in that area it's a lot more work to do the pump than just the the tubes\nYou're actually taking on another operational rice in all that of almost two separate is not in stream with what you're doing really and on water\nPump bolts anytime you pull ... out of a block like that you want to\nRice and all that of almost two separate not in stream with what you're doing really and on water pump boats anytime he pulled both out of a block like that you want to put New Zealand on anything that was sealed when you took it out sometimes you'll find both the longer ones you pull them out you'll see that threads dealer on them they need to be completely cleaned\nRe sealed and and put back in\nJust the ones which dealer if you get the sealer on something that does not have seen it on it you can actually break the block by twist and something in from the hydraulic pressure of the boat going into a whole like that\nThat help you out yep thank you very much appreciate\nThat very much for the call eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Jack Jack you're on the end of the show we do for you\nSay you know or you're a member of one factor hair high school days mom found out checks to compare in your closet and he said for keeping up for somebody else\nNot me [laughter] never happened to them calling [laughter] I wasn't I didn't bring it in the house [laughter] I can hide it in a car [laughter]\nWell I'm calling I'm calling for a guy or gal oh I'm dark I\nSaw that you know we got a two thousand two hundred and fifty three and it's got about a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on it and that you can get like try and they asked how does somebody ... fat and that she had always lean on both ...\nNo ... for ... ...\nDid you say jak two thousand and two is it a five point for\nFor for a true oh it's the four to six cylinder\nOkay look for vacuum lines leaking on the on the edge and look at the back side of the intake manifold where the PC valve disconnected were hidden and you can't see it there was a rubber boots on there those boots tear often\nJust from age and when they do they'll they'll loud too much air and the engineering will give you a lean on both thinks that's the first thing to start with look for look for symptoms things like that that might cause it to run Leno we've mentioned it before but\nWe've had a some people that have used the they've either never used it before\nAnd made the switch to a ten percent ethanol or they've always use ten and now they've gone to Fifteen and because of the nature of it it causes field for him to run a little higher on the engine which is perfectly normal\nIt's that's what the engine filtering through four to adjust for different fuels and things like that but the vehicle system is ... dilapidated enough you're yeah you're right on the edge so you know when you're in your situation\nYou're right on the edge probably if you were to read feel terms with the scanner of no light and light so now you're into that light rain so if you fix whatever was causing that little league your fuel mileage is bound to go up as well\nIt's probably just a ... first thing to start with his look for those back give it a good physical inspection and also look at the masterful sensor and make sure it's clean because of dirty masterful sensor can give you that same issue a couple of things to look at hand\nThat help you out there jacked up\nYeah thank you very much thanks very much for the call we're going to take a quick break you're listening to the under the hood show with the
