kind of you know towards the end of it that oh wow uh this is all about memory and I've learned\nThat everything I thought about memory is probably wrong I'd like to tell you what it was but I don't trust my memory anymore so Malcolm Gladwell is here hello Malcolm how are you\nHey Glenn I'm doing very well I uh ... thank you for your podcast there's just so great um I don't think that's very kind of you I I wanted to I've been thinking about you a lot lately because of the Kavanaugh hearings and and everything else and I don't want to get into the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhen I Do want to talk about is our memory\nAnd how it can be changed manipulated how it's natural for these things to happen\nI mean you explained the uh Brian Williams story in in such a different way because you didn't can damage him [laughter] I knew didn't exonerate him you just said let's look at the facts on memory yeah can you take us through it\nYeah the so memory is something that in the last generation\nA psychologist has spent an enormous and they're all just I've spent an enormous time\nI'm amount of work and effort trying to understand how it works and the more we learn about memory the ball we realize how valuable it is\nAnd we more and when we systematically go back and we test our memories we find they don't do very well um so there's a famous set of studies that are called ... studies where a famous event happened nine eleven\nOr the challenger explosion and you go to a large group of people the incident happened and say\nTell me everything you were doing thinking\nOn the moment when you heard that news where were you who did you talk to first how did you feel you know what happened that day and then they go back to the same group of people\nA year later five years later ten years later they asked him to same sex question and they compare their answers and lo and behold what you discovered is that not everyone that many of the people substantially alter\nTheir memories of the event without realizing it and there was they are the first time they'll say when I heard when I saw the towers fall I was standing in the streets of Manhattan with my best friend Jim tears streaming down my face\nHistory seriously\nHave you heard from Brian Williams sincere podcast\nNo I have I threw out one day I'll read it read it yet and I mean he he can he can't be can't publically say that's true that's great but you know poor man I I think he was like part of it I'm sure it was like I Can't believe it's breaking up again\n[laughter] Malcolm thank you so much for being on the program that I really appreciate it has all this you about\nMalcolm Gladwell a ... well and also if you have not heard this mud cast it is so relevant to what we're going through right now a it is especially listen to a wish I would have asked him about the German or the spies oh my gosh is a great story [noise]\nUm but listen to on it's a two part about the German spies listen just even start

makes you uncomfortable listen to this because it will give you especially if you think that Brian Williams absolutely is just a pig or listen to this because it will challenge you and you if you're

that\nThey were just talking about memory but let's talk about another thing that is a misunderstood or underutilized\nYou know are gone flaw forgotten in American that's bravery\nI have no idea what Malcolm Gladwell political benches I don't really care um I like him I think he's smart when he votes for I don't care I'm he could be conservative we could be liberal do no again don't care\nBut let's let's just say maybe he's liberal maybe fifty fifty shot\nHe just came on this program\nAnd he talked to me\nAbout a portion of the Kavanaugh hearings with out expressing either condemnation or support\nHe spoke about memory and how it applies to both Kavanaugh and Ford you know how dangerous that is for him\nBut it was you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to him about Kavanaugh strike too you didn't say an opinion on Kavanaugh strike three you're out yeah I mean any weather ...\nRegardless of his personal politics a lot of listeners would be from the left um\nAnd so you know but that's like but he doesn't care the ... well he he doesn't care it's something that we need it is it something that we need people just being willing to be honest and and just talk about talk about what\nWe can talk about things without making everything about politics\nEven though this story the reason why I had him on\nIs because it's very ... today but that's he did the podcast before Kavanaugh yeah nothing to do and nothing to do with it and so when we talk now in light of this can we just talk about what you found on memory right because it's important it's the reason why I honestly I Would listen\nTo him on Brian Williams yes because he's credible if you reach all mad out came out and so I understand or did that I wouldn't you know you never but like Malcolm so credible because he's not doing he's actually looking for an answer right\nYeah and that's what I think it is so absent\nIn so many places you know right now I mean it's you know it's it you don't oh wait beer sides not always right um but\nIt it's okay to keep your principles and and maintain your arguments and and believe things are morally correct the way you do\nBut there's no reason why you can't entertain and be challenged by someone who has a different opinion I feel like that's what you know one of the things that's been interesting about the cabinet thing because those on the left here and you know the prominent ones on the left\nHave been so\nI mean I Want to use the technical term bonkers on the story so over the top so ridiculous and so many ways\nAh thanks gave I mean I I just made a book out to eat I'm gonna send it to you addicted outrage will a pop it in the mail today real quickly let me go to Eddie and South Carolina then pappy your pets here from the

I Can't add this king ah\nYeah I really support us okay go ahead but\nHe made the statement right before he got his low ball and he is the name play ... the room he said I was in senator Feinstein's office when she got out of four letter\n[laughter] yes the pretty thorough agent they're All right\nOkay so did he know that the letter to\nYeah I I mean eddy hit is really clear I thank you for your phone call um and it's kinda like talking to Lindsey Graham is [laughter] um uh\nThis leak came from somebody I personally think the the you know the the authorities should should look into the leak I think it's really rotten what ah what happened to Ford pat\nWelcome to the program and thank you good you know you hear it it really it it it it really is you wouldn't you wouldn't just say that I Know and you can't think of any other place could you know that I'd rather be yeah no so your experience with Kavanaugh because we went into this last night on the news\nAnd why it matters if you if you miss last night's broadcast the news and why it matters you should listen to it because uh\nThere was quite an expos they really do nights ago I Believe ... violations go before last night before last starting ... ... ... and you notice the press never picked up I Know I Know I went to yeah they don't they don't care yeah or when this happened to\nParticularly men writing can then men on the right right they don't care they don't care and uh I'm not going to go into it here but when you were there were there I was you know it I was there so well we live\nVery near a Yale for three years and I went to you when you went to Yale\nYeah so um San salted Kavanaugh and I distinctly remember yeah oh I don't even want to bring it yeah don't even I wouldn't have July I have a a a fan in my uh bathrooms\nYou know when you turn on the light of my bathrooms I have a fan there yeah every everybody because of of that memory but anyway so [laughter] so what he really yes I'm ... so uh do it washes code so [laughter] so [laughter] so I'm pat\nWhat's on your mind today a well of course Kevin is on my mind he's always on my mind never far from my thought and uh and uh\nI it's it's fascinating to see how are you know just kind of outlined how the Democrats wanted investigation got one wanted it expanded still got a ...\nA wanted it delayed so it was and now now that it's all been done and we're wrapping up and they found nothing now they want even more investigation and when would this ever end\nI think in two thousand twenty is when it when it if you if you are yeah I let him continue this process but ah\nThe latest thing from the roommate who knows who knows for a fact that cabinet was lying about his drinking habits and those words in his year\nBook in high school ... do bring them up uh\nIowa do bro don't bring up the word no do move do so it's by hand devil's triangle don't\n... 'cause you know what those are about obviously they're uh well at least his roommate knows that\nThey were um sexually Mm charge words and which would make a huge difference in whether he should be a Supreme Court justice forty years later if you if you ...\nTerms that were about ... he asked the Supreme Court as ... then it's OK yeah as a teenager right as a teenager because nature's don't do that no only than there was reckless heinous serial killers they usually start to show signs of serial killing ... around sixty\nYeah that's usually what happens most serial killers or I Know I think we talked about this the other day do you guys are you familiar with the word moved 'cause yeah I've heard in the middle ear with that it's yeah it's pretty widely understood to be flatulence\nIt's interesting all three of us off is a different thing yeah all three of us had never enough\nUh recollections of what that word meant India might actually was the sexual use I remember once at both yea or boss both buff I think both sides both would be really a kind of\nOkay and what is it ... but like Glenn had a a drug reference yeah and I thought maybe I'm wrong but I looked it up and they are making an area and it is it's also a drug reference and then pat ... yeah\nI mean I honestly when I read that I was like ... he's probably trying to cover for himself because it might thought that is actually what it was it was like a sexual term but\nThen I ... I mean we all three of us young people have different recollection of a different area yet right different schools where a different backgrounds different you know I mean like that so it could mean anything really good they're not going to get thrown in jail I never heard of I don't know what that it yeah\nI don't know what that is well let me explain [laughter] ah but that's the way the way everybody cares about this stuff when and I think you guys mentioned this early in the show when there was a president\nWho admitted to far worse than this stuff\nNo nor worse than we don't have it on tape and if we did have it on tape gonna lay it right now\nI think I was a thug [laughter] for a for a big part of my\nGrowing up I Know I I was I think I was a very typical uh uh a gang rape is areas

and six pack in the hour before class yeah and in and out on a soapbox and go to the last drunk yeah\nI mean nobody cared about that stuff no\nNo no don't worry about it and by the way where was that stuff when he was running where was that right where what we have to we have to have an ... calendars uh-huh but uh this guy has that the press never did it and no one in the press and they would be the right\nTo not do it would would hear that and say oh well he case look at you look at his temperament I mean he was right he admitted to fights he admitted to fights he admitted to chugging beers we didn't have any and illegal activity his\nTemperament they would've never said that and which is more important he is\nThere's only one executive cabinet I was going for a position where he's won nine of the court so far more important for the one guy you know to be able to have that disposition to be able to have that temperament and be able to have that John you're like here's why here's

emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free from the bondage of the fence\nYou're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not shutting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to the\nYoung lady called a

come clean for the last two\nGrotesque violent unbelievably violent crime\nI Can't imagine can't imagine going say something like that\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from

ever\nTo someone who raped ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with them you know someone steals your wallet you can forgive them but you're not gonna\nYou know leave your wallet with them later

of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what

over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us on the leave all\nSo he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous any seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that may not have control and they don't have any\nWhile until trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild

anybody else's and so we're not gonna treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you too you prove
