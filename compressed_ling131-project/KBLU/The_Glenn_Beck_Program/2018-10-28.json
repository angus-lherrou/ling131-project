and a\nCouple of things I don't like about that one when you do that you're not really getting the experience of spending your actual money for a phone so you miss out on the fun of spending a thousand dollars on yeah [laughter] well but I think that these phones are so expensive now it's important to feel that pain\nDo you think there's going to be um this is a personal question but do you think there's going to be any Black Friday deals on iPhones never [laughter] oh darn\nBills they give you are so pathetic it's good to get a ten dollar armies record\nWell when I bought this three

we'll find out if we're getting close\nOr the other thing I Would reason I buy these phones is 'cause you can't in two weeks really get a sense of what it's like to to use the problem is now I don't really want to carry four phones with me\nSo I'm trying to figure out some rotational method for phone numbers or if I if I Do but the limit is five 'cause I use Google Voice and you can have a one Google Voice number call five different phones [laughter] so that's kind of what I Do and that way you ought to be\nIn here when somebody calls me all our phone\nRang and they all have different isn't it ring tone yeah where they have to otherwise yeah\nJohn Will call you right now let's let's test\nThere's no I've got 'em all new to talk of the other downside when I get to work I got a lot of work to do to mute all these phones yeah as I say all really look exactly the same they're all just like black last slabs kept always think\nMute this one this one is easy with the I have ... yeah thank goodness the apple still have a physical switch\nWhich is really at the right way to do it anyway and that's about my phone situation we have real telephones people can call a da da da da da\nAnd Virginia thinks that one of her friends Scott Facebook hacked or maybe so she's not really sure oh dear what precautions you\nKnow she wants to know what mine from just deleting it like you I guess yeah thank you Ken Hi Cheryl Alexandria, Virginia welcome we'll report the tech guy\nThinks a whole lot listening this morning I got a\nFacebook Messenger message I'm from somebody that I knew casually on Facebook friends with them and this was a first Facebook Messenger is that I had ever gotten from Lauren in except it it started a little bit of conversation on that thing got suspicious and\nSadly this couple had built their retirement home in a New Bern North Carolina\nGot flooded so badly and or\nHopefully this couple had built their retirement home in a New Bern in North Carolina they got flooded\nSo badly or ... or ... you know somebody trying to take advantage of that with money that\nWas it was a state book that was how was it was it somebody she has a very common name to somebody just\nTake her name and in drinking the account and has has my phone learn about ... account like clean up their personalities she clean it up\nSo many questions so and I don't blame you for wearing these days we all know that Facebook uh was in fact vulnerable at least thirty million people got their Facebook account ... so the there are a couple of ways people do this particular kind of thing you're the first one of the easiest way for them to impersonate somebody\nAnd and that Facebook makes it fairly easy I've had it happened to me at least several times because if you have a Facebook page they can take you know anything that's public and for most people that's a lot the images the banner your you know personal information\nAnd create a new account with a slight difference they can't use the exact same account name [noise] but they but since a lot of people don't assign a name to a Facebook account it's pretty easy to do this\nSo 'cause they can make it the same name\nYou know the public name it's just the the the Web pages has to be different you know the the official link has to be different so if your name is Emily ... Johnson\nA ... there are maybe ten as you know there may be ten thousand Facebook pages for an Emily gee Johnson and if it has the same pictures St profile picture it's almost impossible distinguish it so that's the most likely\nScenario um the second most likely scenario is that they got hacked and as I said Facebook announced thirty million people were hacked due to a flawed Facebook\nThey reset all those accounts so even though they had been hacked unless somebody use that opportunity to take the account over uh it's it's not and it's hard to get your account hack although\nYou know if you use a password like monkey one two three and easily guest password um that's also possible\nSo it might not be a bad idea to to contact or that person out of bed you know on a phone caller message or email message and say hey just question do you know was this huge we have a conversation sounds like you know that it isn't so that's that's a case where you might say it's happened ... now have you been hacked\nUnless you click the Lincoln downloaded something or were taken to a\nKind of fraudulent page no just getting a message is harmless but to be careful about links in these messages because they can link you know the bad guy wants to run appropriately\nSo they can link to\nMilitias pages and which programs to impact you we'll report\nFive sixty maybe oh yeah oh\n\nWow you know the IMAX has one of those centers here in LA and I was thinking about going to one that was ... everybody was thinking thinking about\nYou know most of the I looked at their website actually and I saw that most of them are you know shoot 'em up type things are really scary action movies yet or action yeah up and I just want to go and and you know be in a world and they have it be beautiful but then you know I guess I don't know [laughter] I ...\nI should I I misspoke not movies but we are experiencing it was right\nNear and dear yes correct but you bring up an interesting point and that is I've always thought it\nWouldn't it be cool to put on a a high resolution VR headset and watch a movie as if you were watching a a you know a fifty foot screen at a at a movie theater right up to ... and there I had been a couple of people who have ... a couple of companies that have tried to do that but it never took off and I think one reason is\nEven now VR goggles the best we are goggles you could buy are still pretty low risk right can see the pixels yeah because they're right at\nTheir inches from your eyes approach ... you're right ... so I don't I ... it takes me right out of the action right out of the story of the the movies trying to tell me so I I just say nah\nDoes anybody sell a non for K.

in music not anywhere else just end the call we've done everything from shutting off wife by two week setting them re storm doing everything and I figured\nMaybe yourself maybe the chat room maybe someone out there might have an idea as to why but a lot of us are facing the same with oh\nSo there's two there's two different Bluetooth profiles away or when you hear Bluetooth you choose a profile the one you used with music that actually several most comment is called a too deep you there's also ... he's a fool frequency luscious sounding Kodak\nBut there's also a Bluetooth headset Kodak that is terrible it sounds like a phone call because there was no need to use more bandwidth because well that's how phone calls sounded\nA and they do sound clip being distorted and and and scratchy\nFor

handle it\nSo I'm not sure what Apple's doing in terms of profiles but normally when you use\nBluetooth anything there's different profiles depending on how you're using it and when you're using a headset profile you know you wouldn't you wouldn't want to listen to music on the headset profile that sound like a phone call\nSo I'm not sure if that's what's\nGoing on now there are um and and

a too deep you mode\n... you would think that apple their pods would be as good as it can get a but I'm not sure exactly uh what Apple's doing overall and I haven't I haven't heard that you've seen people complain about this in the forums and so forth\nOh yeah I've done my you know mainly I always make sure that if I asked a call\nKim was very kind to let me on today but you know I also noticed something else I Believe or at a five point zero but they're using for pointe shoe I Believe it is\nYeah there you that's it that's exactly that's got to the ... yeah why not what's going on there apple so\nI let her going out to the company to say why is it your behind the eight ball where we're not using the latest and Bluetooth\nTechnologies airing calm and this is a I think people sometimes think Apple's going to be a tech leader they're not they're ...\nThey never want to be the first one to use any technology so it took them forever for instance to use\n'em NFC near field communication is well all the other phones are\nUsing touch to pay and you were able to tap I'm On a Bluetooth devices to pair and so forth apple only started doing that a couple of generations ago and even then only allowed for Apple particular uses apple pay and specifically\nAnd only recently have they started to open up the NFC a PI so they're way behind same thing with wireless charging same thing with a lot of things it's so\nIt's not at all surprising that their paws would not support Bluetooth five\nApples a funny beach because of course they count the fact that we're we we develop the W one ship\nJust to make sure Bluetooth sounded better and worked better actually they didn't say sounded better I think the only said worked better on the Airbus\nEverybody thinks there's an air pod second generation just around the corner maybe they'll announce it on Tuesday although I'm not seeing the rumors of that uh I Would I Would really expect the second generation and until then I don't think the airports are the best Bluetooth headset you can get a Bluetooth to me is really\nTroublesome it's one of the reasons I'm Still angry that apple and Google and others are dropping the headphone Jack really bugs me of the\nOf the four phones in front of me only one has a headphone Jack that's the Simpson nine really drives me nuts 'cause honestly wired is still better you can always sound better and it's not going to drop out and it's not going to have problems\nI noticed that yeah so blue to what point rails on things and well yeah I'm with you but you yeah\nAh apple apple will adopt Bluetooth five later\n[laughter] I don't know where we don't need it\n'cause when six comes out which is five ah is fairly new uh ... it was it was uh the phone supported by the way um they have Bluetooth five in the ... everything from the iPhone up so they started\nLast year um but I guess they didn't you know maybe they're ... came out a little earlier they weren't developmental earlier and they didn't feel like\nGood that's just apple and I\nI don't think people by you you shouldn't buy apple to be on the cutting edge\nThe theory that apple lives by that most apple observers say apple you know actually in bodies is we're gonna take existing technology and make it work better\nThat's where the you know the W one ship in the air power in St Louis is we're not going to check which is five big blue do to make it work better um\nYou you you iPhone is not by any means cutting edge technology\n\nIt doesn't support five gee for instance uh although no phone yet supports five gee the only one I Know it was the Motorola\nAh I'm at the G ...\nPlay no this is the Motorola Z\nThree which has a doesn't really support five gee but ... has a place you could snap on a mode of mud that will give it five gee if that ever comes around\nApple won't do five gee first they won't do any technology first but their theory is but we're going to do it better so you might as well wait I Wish apple\nMade an iPhone that was three hundred four hundred dollars as well as always expensive was because then I could very with great happiness recommend\nJust don't even consider any other phone just by phone but\nHonestly they're they're so expensive in fact all of the stuff is so expensive there are better Bluetooth headphones out there in fact I'd love to hear from you which ones do
