E. these\nEight had been counted so far\nThe Clintons the Obamas Eric Holder John Brennan care of CNN Debbie Wasserman Schultz George Soros Maxine Waters and Robert De Niro all recipients of these extremely ridiculous I eat these so\nFirst oh these pipe bombs to get an accurate\nComparison you'd have to watch a a Warner Brothers Saturday morning cartoon to see anything even remotely close this I'm shocked that they don't say\nAcne back me bomb on it pipe bombs are made from Steele why\nReason steel is used to because the entire purpose of the bomb is to utilize the steel shrapnel went and explodes you put the explosive inside the pipe when it blows\nTo utilize the steel shrapnel went in explodes you put the explosive inside the pipe when it blows up the pipe breaks up and you have shards that terror people apart\nWell [noise]\nThe attacker who\nThe press is saying it has a real level of sophistication [laughter] what world vis attacker who I'm giving the code name Wylie coyote has\nMade his bomb out of plastic PVC pipe plastic so when it blows up it vapor rises the plastic it does it defeats the entire\nPurpose of a pipe bomb also v devices had protruding wires coming out of the PVC pipe with a big ridiculous looking digital timer tapes to it\nAgain this is not something you go on the Internet it never shows you to build a bomb this way\nAll of the wires and the detonator usually concealed inside the pipe I don't know goes through an x-ray machine just see a big metal pipe probably is not gonna make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their home\nBut if you have a long pipe Blake thing and it shows wires and in the X ray you can see that there is a timer on the outside it's definitely not going anywhere\nAnd and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely\nBe school until I tell you something I Know this is true because uh I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from the get the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home

it\nEnough she is\nI mean she's she's not even in Congress anymore right so\nAh but she they sent her to the office or that it was sent back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact check their claim but that was what they were attempting to ah to pass off a sophistication I I've never built a bomb no one don't intend to in my life\nUm but it\nWould you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because we put a big metal pipe is going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to\nGet past screening that's good but that shows\nThat you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ or your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I don't even know but\nThe shows that you do not understand why a pipe bomb is destroying\nThe answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will ... it'll still be detected because and that's why he had to in my opinion that's why I had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing because like you you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in this bottle of water you know like ...\nYou know like if there is no slipping this past the screening right like that ... that I think to the other two things\nThat back this up our one a ... you made it in in a way that was so none of them blew up right like yeah ... percent ten bombs around the country none of them explode right like so it seems to be that maybe you didn't want them to explore possibly the other part is why do you put a sticker with a mean on their\nJobs and less it's not going to explode and people are gonna be able to write and I want to get into that and I also want to ask the question why would you put an alarm clock on it in the mail you yeah I don't know when it's going up you don't know why is there a clock on this thing

I Love this\nA ... the headline on CNN Trump a Trump I'm a mocks media as explosives investigated well\nWait ... you guys were blaming Trump mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs or even found you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN is there is really irresponsible he doesn't have gone over Ella edge they worked a target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't know like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there is a political motive but that's a ...\nA political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who was mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS mean right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um but it it seems to indicate someone who wanted these things to be seen every single part of this that we\nJust talked about a no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and de ... like that because the postal service is not an\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but\nThey are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nYou not to say that you know\nThat that that it's a it's a it since we're proving anything but you have to at least keep your mind open to the idea that there are no jobs on both sides with crazy motivation in a intense time look what they did the freaking capping off with people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it\nHere's here's the amazing thing do you remember the time\nRight after nine eleven for the first few years when something would be saying something would happen and we would hope\nThat it was somebody from the middle east you remember that ... where we didn't want it to be an American no matter which side they were on we didn't want that to happen\nNow we just our dog piling on it for them it's them whichever them if you ... you know helps your political position it's them\nWe we don't even consider anything else we don't even consider that modern oh maybe the Russians are involved maybe this is just\nA an outside influence yeah probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd everyone is the media is just condemning the right you have no evidence and I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is\nMentally disturbed and has no real\nAnd and I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is mentally disturbed and has\nNo real understanding of anything that he's doing or he's left you will not hear that they will change the narrative immediately to well it is kind of thing happens and it happens all the time and it could happen where it where it didn't go off and it could happen where it is\nA right wing extremist they'll just change the narrative it won't slow them down at all\nWhat did you think what was the part of this that's a that's ... ... getting your attention but well the first of all the fact that none of them have gone off yeah and the list of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical I wing target\nI have this bomber ... code name Wylie coyote [laughter] the only thing he didn't do is leave a plate of bird seed next to it and yeah I mean it's so obvious it's cartoonish to start\nWith George Soros a and to include Robert Deniro and all\nOf these ... scene waters all of the typical plays it just to convene it's too much for they don't\nGo off and it's that perfect list of the people that the right really doesn't like that\nI live in a car to ... it is it's a cartoon list it is\nNow ... so it could ... don't don't get me wrong\nAnd I think you're probably saying this to it could be it could be a left a a right wing or it could have you are right wing ... we have no idea if it is a right wing person\nThey live in a cartoon world yeah they're ridiculous ridiculous they they they're so in that\nThat they can't make a but they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's chagrin when they said yesterday well shows the level of sophistication tacit ... here\nNone of them went off and like there's no if you can't get one of the tend to go off what level of sophistication you have it right low and it's so cartoonish there's no level of sophistication I I like this\nCan you guys help me figure out the needle CNN is attempting to thread here they write this is a from Brian filters newsletter thought she's most of the recipients were prominent Democrats or as the ... or Washington Post simply put it amid incendiary rhetoric targets of

was okay as long as you were dressed up like a character there was a controversy on the real housewives of New York would land as she got is Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd I felt like she wants to look like they interrupt or one day I I don't know how like that got raises on Halloween\n... amazing and is it is a is such a\nQuestion that you should be drummed out of all society right\nBut that's what's amazing about the first of all we should point out that there's a lot of people died of NBC\nThat wanted her up for other reasons actually only you know you do to pushes logging Kelly this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded\nHad she not come from Fox that she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever that crowd would've applauded her young and I think that there's a lot of people that it didn't appreciate her coming out against\nNBC personalities on the sexual assault stuff as well but just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exist and talk about back but actual conversation her point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation\nRight the motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important what's go further than black face for a second\nThe N. word right\nN. word when fed by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock does it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation is not because he just terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in the spring starts to Charlottesville who know their name just spit on to this with racism but I mean you know we are talking about here\nThe the if you have an outright figure you're Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist thing be and what it means something different and the motivation is different in that it's important\nBut it but I Will say that it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody you don't get drunk out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred racism another example is\nBecause everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia is a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history fourteen season it's going I signed up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episodes where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface what they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a liberal icon of a program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nWell for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they have a situation where they all wake up ... after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know then the animation but it's still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of theirs happens to be black and they don't stand up comics right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well\nYou'd think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him said that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay he said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos\nMany things try to buy a ... and his party deliberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis is just the latest stunned and ... a blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through\nThis is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala\nBut there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nThis is really sad and frustrating because many migrants ... a has been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with the hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre or might have been the organizers of the march we'll take advantage of\nPlease keep spreading the truth about this situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller in a world of lies God Bless you and the family at the blaze for all that you do\nFrom someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras that is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we had can do you know just as [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] you know I was gonna say you know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists because they're not really a journalist but then I thought of\n...\nA he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and it's that everyone keeps saying\nIt was but then I thought of ...\nHe's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and that's what everyone keeps saying I I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he\nWrote five five five columns for the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ...\nFive ... I mean you'd probably written five columns out here to have places like the rest of ... I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to the yeah I notice now you're a journalist or journalists aren't\nDoing their jobs the ... news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that care of and\nUm we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in a Congress in the Senate and what the president can do a and how we\nCan hold Mexico accountable and these other countries accountable if they just passed their problem on to us\nI feel for on doors because these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country and they're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd our press is not duped by them\nThis is why it's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the\nPeople yeah yeah I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of the truth and whether that is intentional or you are just unbelievably a\nLacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable\nIn how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling you in the next cubicle what'd you all just are agreeing on\nOh look at this bombs come in there's ten of them none of them have gone off they're they're they're not even pipes there's they're PVC pipes that defeats the reason of having a pipe bomb you want the shrapnel\nOf the middle of the pipe as it blows up while yes but they put glass inside a glass glass is not the same as ball bearing you put metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a tie him or why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nWhere do you expect somebody to open it up and then like I guess I should set this for two minutes ... that doesn't make any sense\nThat kind of seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up saw that it was some device\nWalked it over to the woods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blow it up right but I mean that's like ... if this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened\nDoesn't seem that to be that there was a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't set a time through the mail adult attendance is ridiculous very strange ridiculous\nUh let me go to Kim in Virginia who is a US mail carrier or hello Kim\nHey Ryan I'm actually from outside of Charlotte shell [laughter]\nOh what a hateful racist even those\nThat are not city I never I never Dan\nYeah well I I just want to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so just in my\nFamily I could not family but I Try to catch it\nWant to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so\nThat my family I said my family to both protests not because we want to be a part but I wanted my kids to see it 'cause I'm like you're not going to learn history unless they go to these places so wow well\nAnyway so why is it anyway yeah I'm a mail carrier in about three years um I'm not buying that it's being shipped to them and they're being sent to the mail at all um it's about three fifty to send a first class parcel\nUm I heard some of the news yesterday saying something about that like excessive postage and all this on it but it forever stance you know it's good for whatever you know the prices that goes up to um to me that six chance they're not even three fifty um there's no cancellation marks so there's no way\nIt went through a processing plant and they cannot have Donald over the counter because of the courts where I picked up on that if I'm deliver it now and I come across something like that I don't deliver it that it had not been process\nI take it back question at you know anything a letter or anything so that that's like all these red flag like what what how how are they getting delivered if it's not the postal service well that was the one that I saw the picture I watched it and say oh\nYeah well there was one today that was found in the uh postal office in Delaware I think there's another one\nYou say that yeah so\nBut I I I I Wonder the same thing I look for the cancellation of insulation\nWas supposedly delivered by career which would be completely from the U.S postmaster\nYeah yeah 'cause they say we're pretty you know we're working I work for show and then you know tall you don't get anything like I say even a letter with no cancellation march we deliver it get sent back against you know return to sender it we we don't pregnant the clerks to do what they're going to do with it up\nLet me ask you if you got a piece of a package in the mail and it said it came from Glenn Beck and it had assigned book it it would you open it or would you just immediately throw it away\nHad or what if you had assigned book from Glenn Beck a in a well I Would I Would I Would open it all out and I know that I'm going to make one I'm going to make one word it to him I'm going to make this an\nAn act me book [laughter]\nA lot of Jim I appreciated your copy of the outrage is on the way\nThat's ah that's cool I mean it seems consistent with what I've heard

sleep you're looking for a new mattress you owe it to yourself to just try it\nNow here's the way a Casper mattress works you don't go to a um you don't go to a mattress store\nBecause it's a mattress
