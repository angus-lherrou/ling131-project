these pipe bombs but it is it's unusual that none of them went\nOff highly unusual or it is highly unusual but they were made with PVC pipe which shows that they were made by either a moron or somebody who didn't want to do a lot of damage because the ...\nShrapnel that uh is important for the pipe or they also didn't put ball bearings or anything else and if they put glass which was not again not as effective\nUm if you're making a a pipe bomb they also had a cheap timer a wired to it why would you put a timer on something that is going through the mail\nOr the wires run the outside ... it just doesn't make any sense this just doesn't make any sense if you wanted to kill people\nIt also had a a a a right wing name on it a had a the Arabic flag or the ISIS flag and underneath that it just said get her done\nWould you put that on a pipe bomb and how come none of them went off\nBecause they're not hard to do this has happened before in fact it was it was really quite bad Nineteen Nineteen\nMayday Nineteen Nineteen uh\nAnarchists and communists decided that they were going to target um people that were in the FBI the Justice Department newspaper editors the mayor of Seattle who is anti union at the time and magic that\nBusinesspeople senator of Georgia received one of these bombs his housekeeper picked it up when she tried to open the male she opened in blue or hands off the senator's wife lost teeth her face was horribly scarred from fire it was\nHorrible horrible twelve bombs went off twelve bombs went off\nSeventeen were in the mail that they caught before they were delivered\n\nSo this has happened before\n\nLater the next month of June eighth bombs were set around the country in major cities did massive damage these were all to protest the anti immigration rules that had been put in\nThey were saying let's slow down on some of the immigrants coming in because we have to know if they're good guys or bad guys because we're bringing in a lot of people that believe in socialism in communism\nAnd they believe in evolution and we know what happened in Russia we can't have those people come in here\nAnd that's why the communists the immigrants in this particular case were\nBombing when the bombs went off\nIt's interesting that everything there was a ... a note came with all of these bombs see if that sounds familiar it's as war yes class war\nBecause you're the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order and in the darkness of your uh laws\nIs that something that could be written by the left today\n\nIt didn't just happen once the next year September sixteenth Nineteen twenty but Wall Street bombing\nOne hundred and forty three people were seriously injured thirty eight were dead\nThink of the impact at that time\nHundred and forty three seriously injured thirty eight\nThis leads me to if I'm ever\nIn New York and people are have not been to New York there's a few places I like to take them and one place I always take them is twenty three Wall Street across the street is where George Washington gave his first inaugural address\nCross the street and the other direction is Wall Street the New York stock exchange you know where that is then there's the building it's called the corner\nAnd it's a building if I showed it to you you would recognize that you've seen in a million times it was built in Nineteen Thirteen by a J. P. Morgan it was the Morgan house if you will his office was in there\nOne of the bombs went off right next to that building but Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything thirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured\nThe bomb went off just off of the sidewalk and it didn't affect his building\nExcept there are ... marks from the shrapnel in the building look it up twenty three Wall Street\nYou'll see the shrapnel on the side of that building the pocket parks and Morgan said we're not going to repair it leave it there\nAs a symbol that no one scares us no one is going to push us into a revolution no one is going to scare\nUs leave it there don't try to hide or cover up those pockmarked now I don't\nKnow how many people in the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the right historically speaking it's almost always the left\nNow this might be the right those might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done uh\nAnd so this guy built these bombs and built him in such a way that they were never going to explode\nI don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\n\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off remember Nineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off\nSeventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could go off\nThis time not a single bomb went off we're\nDealing with somebody who has not just the lack of sophistication but is completely incompetent and may be crazy and I thank God for that no one was hurt or injured but there is the other possibility\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get here\nThe odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event and it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nMike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid have been following the news or on the caravan here locally\nUh been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a\nA lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government\nEver since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his ... which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis latest sons of as a ... a blames America and has made America is now reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we uh Hondurans are living through\nSadly the migrants have been lied to and have been told that America must accept them in one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them some of the migrants have returned home\nMexico for reasons unknown as of yet what's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a told that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrive in America\nThere for many or good with hopes of a better life but this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\nSomebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the Caribbean or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarified that you cannot claim asylum simply because your home country is unsafe\nBy definition by law aside least face\nIn individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in the caravan to remain of the United states ah we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this statement you just read is part of it is\nA narrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem and I think it needs to be called out at such just because they have a country that is a mess that it is a government that has made life unpleasant for everyone there\nDoes not mean that any particular person necessarily has a valid claim for asylum in the United states\nMike have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On a that Venezuela is behind the funding of of this\nUm I had not heard that but ah we're hearing all the time different theories about who might be funding it ... that is interesting it's an interesting theory that Venezuela might be doing it begins Venezuela is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make it to the border Mike I mean the male the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number has no fourteen thousand I think that's hard to believe but you know even have five thousand people at the border what do we do\n[noise] it's um difficult to say I hope and pray that it doesn't come to that because\nFirst of all think about what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near getting ready to handle that kind of volume but nowhere near ready to be handling the kind of volume that they've already\nGot a and so I I suspect that we will need to um bring out a whole lot of additional human\nResources let's just say in order to make sure that our border isn't completely overrun and that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there was um [noise] and that kind of stampede coming in all at once so we've got to protect our border\nSenator Mike Lee last questions any any comments on um the the multiple pipe bombs that were delivered\nBut tragic it's frightening I condemn anyone who uh who did it then I condemn anyone who says anything ah to applaud or encourage your support that kind of action\nA basis I'm not something we can tolerate in American political discourse and I look forward to that\nThat's ... and I think they should be punished to the maximum extent possible under the law\nYou would classify them a ... let me rephrase that I Would classify whoever did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists\nWithout question without question and they need to be punished the such\n... thank you might appreciate it Senator Mike Lee author of written out of history a great book or if you were looking to learn about the great people and our uh in our country that have passed the people who have been written out of history it's a book is out now Senator Mike Lee\nAlways great to talk to you sir I think you know we're not too that are breaking news that a dramatic respected to\nApprove a request for eight hundred US troops to travel to the U.S Mexico border to provide logistical support for border agents\nOr as the caravan approaches and as a just happening now expect that to come down at least later on today eight hundred\nTroops they think that's the first the first wave that was the what the department of homeland security Nassau requested okay good good\n[noise] All right I Want to talk to a little bit about liberty safe [noise] um I was um\nUh watching a video sent to me by a friend last night of a good friend of mine got fact guy I just adore um who\nWas really\nTruly an amazing mentor of mine Michael O'Shea ... when I was a kid um he owns a group of ah the stations down Santa Rosa California and there's this documentary that they they made and\n... you know the fire started at like eleven o'clock at night\nBy three o'clock in the morning ... everything was on fire I mean it's when you watch this it's really we're not getting a sense outside of California you're not really getting a sense of how destructive and how fast this thing was spreading\nUm and um they showed the footage from inside one of the fire trucks that were called from the outside and they weren't familiar with the area and um they said as they were\nPulling into this area which was supposed to supposed to be safe when they left the firehouse\nThey said go meet us here when they got there it was at Kmart it was the whole k-mart was on fire everything was burned down so they started driving away looking for a safe place like thirty forty minutes into it they were looking in this in the dark and they're seeing for miles what they think are fields\nThat have little fires burning around mhm then they realize that was a ... those were homes on my gosh they were holding complexes and they've been burnt entirely to the ground and those little fires are just what's still left burning\nIt's in rebel and\nUm [noise] the things that you you see what was amazing to me is again if you um\nIf you have any valuables I'm a fan of liberty

know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure\nOkay All right well you can open some mutual funds as little as two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay but you can open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of that you can't be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nOK you can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to go to maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of help things you\nCan't just check in with your smart vest or pro when they can help you get that done Lisa is with us in Austin, Texas Hi Lisa how are you\nSigned think happy I Am having a good day sure I Am how can I Know I'm just starting your program and I'm I'm not sure how to do it when there is no money left she said at the end of the ...\nAt the beginning of the month or any of them [laughter] and I was homeless\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us from Singapore\nA big ball thank you very much and good afternoon how are you going to get a better than I deserve how can I help\nYou out so our first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together\nGreat um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ...\nA voluntary retirement scheme that um is an Singapore so I can put up to thirty five and seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that\nBut that's going to a year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars of doctors mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand jumps cash flow I guess my salary\nMhm what are the penalties for\nRowing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what you're\nYeah it's about fifty first up ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky picky thousand and put into that I can rebuild my return my emergency founded about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that as a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expensive\n\nIt is about twenty three thousand\nOkay that would ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be six months\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen of here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm\nI work here I'm an ex patriots and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to\nEmergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range then I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it is emerging she found is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you gotta decide your definition that is what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash once and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nThat's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student\nI'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the

you think it still possible or somebody like me to run their type of fitness but maybe you're biased on the best business model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we certify people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know\nThe commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so\nYou might explore that angle because truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class where we started doing other

here's the New York times\nOr none of the devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them\nCould have late so these are ...\nAre very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophistication\nI that's what I heard from CNN these pipe bombs show a level of sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices instructed to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh\nYou may have read the story from the New York times\nI had no idea that well they never gave us really any details on ...\n... ... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four ah that's what I like ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left or right Mm okay mhm I with the New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up\nA lot of good stuff towards the yeah when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it it's funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean ah some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonated almost like a Wylie coyote kind of almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... of feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but that's the theory in real life I miss the ceremony in fact the fact that go on the New York\nI'm makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really cheap from tipping off their target and know about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock because they were sending to these people for their death that's what I thought oh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nAll it is that it got an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to kill us they want to do that if they\nPull you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong Italy horrible despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do they don't intend on a you know you saw what happened to for example Dana lashed right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God\nRight so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often ends and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would uh execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I and I just take it\nIs so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make can be big media circus you think they're all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nBut the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah\nYou can spirit is a wire lady for mentioning it but you know let Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy found the top but place in your network so what she said\nWas weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana\nRoss she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question he's ... yeah\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday Glenn I thought about this as we were getting close to we're getting close to Halloween\n... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally African Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally\nThey have one finally after all this time we have in them super hero and one that actually people want to be white kids and black here right now I Want to be so if you're white sun decides he wants to be Black Panther 'em and thinks that it's\nNow of course as a father I Would be like sorry dude you're going to be surprised to hear this but knew you could not do that like we have no awareness\nOf race but I mean if it what he's trying to do is to you know the the one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously noticed is the difference in characteristics that I mean is that a\nA horrible horrible thing for a child to consider ... not to be horrible of a black person dressed up as Superman\nNo no no not that way if they put on white face as Superman no I mean it seems it\nSeems ridiculous you wouldn't do it because you don't ... I don't see a Superman is white or black\nHe's just a Superman it doesn't matter but because of the name of the show was white Superman right black Lance and tried to maintain and just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I Am not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted OK\nGlen what about white face literally this morning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially at [laughter] people will take what's supposed to be funny or and there'll be overly offended by it\nBut none of us need uh we live in a white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later\nNever thought I'd have to tell my kids that from an African American [laughter] miss a thing [noise] amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash we're going the other way for blacks dressing in white\nFace that movie came out depends on your hands on the political climate now yeah there would have never been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are you know you can't even talk about it this is Ken so what did we learn from Megan Kelly\nDo nearly Jerry even ask a question ... chair even asked the\nQuestion here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor\nWe all worked with her we all know\nYou screw with Megan Kelly and she will not Utah ribbons she is wicked wicked smart agree oh ... okay yeah so here's this woman who is working\nAt a place that hired her and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's a great investigative reporter she's great as a interviewer said get at the time they were in a bidding war yeah she was a huge get as soon as the end they all thought this is going to be great\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the network it outside of the networks my goodness how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they realized oh crap\nWe're ... we're in trouble now with all of the fringe but we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have persecuted her persecuted her\nAll the way through so\nWhat happens they see this opportunity she's asked a question that's it she's just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn that even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women\nIs so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC but the very next day this very bright woman\nWho knows who she is goes on television crying literally you can see it in her face\nCrying she so frightened by these people that she says\nI'm Sorry I I I've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look at I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely\nPat stew can either of you give me a note on politically correct to reason why this is so offensive to wear black face like Diana Ross if you are not\nMaking fun of her you're not you're not you're you're inspiring to be someone you admire right men either of you give me a non politically correct\nAnswer in other words you can use political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why ...\nWell the only reason I have is is the one from our ochre and ah which is ... which was that this was used to sort of as a battering ram against blacks in the twenties and thirties\nOK okay they'll hang on on of right sure apps and it really him or the top impersonating exactly right exactly right and that's the twenties thirties ask any millennial ask anyone under thirty who's Mr

the caravan coming from a Honduras\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and

let us be let us be appreciative why does count are blessed\nTo stop I let her take many more bill\nWe're within six hours my crack team found out who these people were what the real intention was\nA

a while on factor on Fox I'm a good man a variation shared their jobs\nAnd a very sincere that nice job running a Ohio but John ... is a theoretical guy\nHe's not a real world guy and people want to know that\nSo he basically saying Americans we have to put ourselves in the position of somebody in Honduras who uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control okay\nBut then what is the point of that exercise governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEvery one\nAnd the same thing with all the poor countries in the world\nBecause that's what your espousing by saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe would leave ... now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight three year backlog right now of asylum um\n[noise] uh hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here for three years

that system governor casing do not understand that\nSee I can and that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer for any of that\nBill tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um\nBecause that's who was on it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified em\nWe said no I'm he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent man so I Believe that these kinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras\nBut I Believe they're behind the biggest ... big money behind it as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what the even the president of ... saying\nI'm this is this is backed by a Cuba or Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and\nAnd they're going to because they're responsible for this ... this is a Marxist a revolutionary uh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now he Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formally known is all about but they are pissed at the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth the joy chores or people like him did this but if\nYou know it's it's one of his things they've done in the past yes but the the government of Honduras should be able to trace foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here so\n... I Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like if they do arrive\nAt the border are and how the press is going to treat this and what do sing Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster for Mexico these people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah\nSo how do they would love shanty\nTowns there with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nNeeds disaster but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tents\nYou in the media would care no\nI don't know it all I Want to know no pictures of the poor baby and you know older and you know but the mother known in a building you\nKnow they care so much about the humanitarian side of this you ... you would think that they would find out is there enough baby formula yeah who is paying for it\nRight or I look we've been over ... over this one over this we don't have a ... a honest press in America anymore which is enormous story that is not being covered by the decide this president going to cover themselves\nSo these guys like you and me we do it but you know the most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on us press and we don't\nWant any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you touched on it about the um one in for college students were in Korea all distress I ... in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P.
