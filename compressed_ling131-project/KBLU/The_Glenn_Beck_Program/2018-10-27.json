L U [noise]\nWell the FBI and may have um arrested while they have arrested a suspect uh in Florida it broke about an hour ago that they were bringing somebody in for questioning now it is a raft of a suspect\nUh his um his a van is covered in stickers I mean the guy's nuts if I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's van looks like you would have picked but yeah uh it covered and\nDecals and seemingly political messages I it yet I Can't quite zoom in to see exactly what they say\nAnd I have covered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it yeah uh but\nUh it do you we've had a blurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nThere at least a ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's certainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be a ... a picture of Trump in the presidential seal mean could it be\nA it could be either to be I don't like this guy's president right I mean I Know it you know again this is what people are speculating at this point it's it's hard to see honestly from the pictures you'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure\nI'm you know they were going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea\nThat he was an as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy I mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is it you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah\nSo we'll see we're going to do fairly quickly\nI think oh this guy may be just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders\nGuy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this maybe our version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\n\nYeah I mean I mean if if if that's true what the van ... and we don't know and should be noted of course he is absolutely not guy [laughter] you know I Know and then if it was but there were ever going to say he's not my guy either yeah um but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter\nIs like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so a terrifying it's not going to beat a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're gonna be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh\nAnd that's what's frightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from Bernie but that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAgain as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for our for shooting Colorado baseball fields endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this\nA product of the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are ...\nWay you're you're you're going to be kicked out you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof did at all of the neighbors even the navy you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family ...\nAnd the pope and all of the pro life activist from all time right\nAnd you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we\nHave standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van [laughter]\nYou know he comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just treat me like I don't believe this guy there is no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right oh maybe that's how that's how he does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I Would [laughter] [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough you would have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh wow\nPlug your to broker he'd be the guy who would try to say we should round up all the people out of hand the anti Christ would be the first one to go [laughter] you know these people are nuts\nI Would be a good suspects I don't know why it's such an irrelevant\nSo I'm Out to see what a what I was certainly a settlement wow I didn't see that one coming that's like what like the really\nBad like lifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time\nThey put you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery store is the guy who did and you're like come on of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody well You're welcome on the anti Christ there you go wow same plot twist\n[laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bomb suspect that's just been arrested in Florida\nYeah it's I I cannot believe there's not a journalist who was taking the high quality photo disadvantage\nHouse it's possible they're all zoomed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it says I Will say you know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda now it's it's sort of difficult to see\nYou know like for example a\nThere's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message to under at that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you think I'm just trying to fish in pretty deep picture I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after I you know like you try to find okay what is the one circumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to\nBe a a his face in a presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know\nThat the media going to try to make this out to be well all from ... or you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter known say all people who have ... we didn't say I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah and that guy was successful\nThat guy actually almost killed people this one didn't there's some didn't and we didn't say that when we could live with\nThe Bernie Sanders guy and you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels\nThere are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on the very harsh left\nOf going back to you know examples like Bill errors in the winter weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street\nWhere there is some idea ideological reasons why certain types of pilots come from the left more often but still there's crazy people all over the spectrum you just said hey you don't want to do it because your sides probably knew something dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just ... correct\nWhen people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to is not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it\nNot to mention it may or not may have nothing to do that at all and it just because you\nHappen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's making Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders\nBy the way that just a fan but campaign volunteer because you're working to get the guy elected\nWho then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault yeah at all not his fault at fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be it would apply here if this is how this thing turns out I Will tell you there's more to find out\nI I Will tell you this think how fortunate we are in a couple of things um go back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland you remember about that you remember that and even remember anybody\nRemember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even wired did they have any of it wired but they were going to blow up bridge in Cleveland\nAh and they had the capability of doing it\nAnd thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know it would have made huge news of the Tea Party would have been doing that right but they didn't they you know Occupy Wall street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just crazy kids um\nBut seeing how fortunate we are that that didn't happen how that could have torn apart think about\nThe blessings that not a single bomb went off that this guy may have been so damn crazy that he really thought well I don't have any gunpowder by I'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot [laughter]\nUh you know this guy is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off\nAnd hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side the world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy now well [noise]\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy\nYeah it's interesting and now they're starting to you know\nWe're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer\nIf [laughter]\nIf it had a combination of things to be\nI Would I Would I Would not assume dons a big soccer fan but who knows a but will ah [laughter] I Will say these things check out again everyone roasted soccer people well we said how long have we said that yeah I think we blame a I think we blame the world cup\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh my gosh the world's top\nBoots and there it is out there it is all going back to the Trump Tower and a meeting with pollutants ally yet this is the mother immediately hit

letting it take over my life\nGood um my question is is how do I budget um for my deductible it locks but recently I recently switched health plan for like ... started again\nI think it was\nLike a chronic illness you're going to get the ...\nRight I'm ... thank\nGod it's nothing on the go it's it's not at all the dance not life threatening are you going to do it every year\nNow okay so ... what what is the nature of this ... also naturally illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that Iran is a it's a pain conditions at the doctors and ensure an award comes on soccer God and so it\nWas a year but I Do is really aren't\nSure because it's relatively new yard I yeah\nWhat I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year and the more experienced got help you that you have with this the better your estimate\nSo it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting

not eating you know\nNot eating outside and you're paying your lights from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shoulders loading in transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as fell out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in here for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying right actually I've I've got ... medical how do I prepare for it you're saving coverage so now that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out\nLong term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career

and we're looking our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding I don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that\nWere not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay off that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... of all I Want to get your input on here\nWe have our ten percent by it but we want to live without thinking about putting data and given back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um\nOther charitable organizations that we believe in that are about doing that the uh you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but and she's on the other hand want straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not um ... and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about either yesterday it was\nI was on the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty if it means to him now you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout\nThe Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed as in the New Testament is a time of the tens of you're in some evangelicals have taught and believed for Fifteen hundred years at that time is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical your wife argument but she was correct biblical

I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got piled the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are ending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do St\nLouis to enter your three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her\nCar today I Would show your trial today and I\nBut I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that out when I make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of that making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and pay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her\nCar\nBut if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nShe's not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you ever marriage problem\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mama's car is not way good way to get mom on board\nLet's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nThan you might be looking at a different career and he's going to be looking at us on our cars and you get her car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this ...\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAnd we look at us on our car and you get her car to drive you drive a car where we get this ...\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply add more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit team dot com\n[noise] Bill O'Reilly on the Glenn Beck program and that's why we're\nKilling the ss because Germany before World War two is not different than the United states in two thousand Eighteen shame people doing the same things to try to struggle to make a living in an atmosphere that was increasingly difficult and what did they do they surrendered and ... and you need to know\nWhat happened there because it could certainly happen here Bill O'Reilly on the Glenn Beck program [noise]\n[noise]\n\nIt's time for friday night football five sixty TBO you present the high school football game of the week our coverage begins with the rebel and wrote pregame show on five sixty ...

heard and he needs to be a he needs to be introduced to a larger audience how ... what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground you've seen the longtime um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a than a fix our calendar\nOr making sure people show up social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team on everything Youtube video production\nAnd whatnot and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue\nThe last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent\nSo you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time searching they're not ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent could win this\nThing so I'm nine points above victory that's to me I get a hundred percent there is the hard part writes a math equation can I get to a hundred percent and\nSadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yeah well I guess really is as well get get remember as third party in general the system is act against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell was stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure everyday this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day is as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him is Tim shelling is his name he there's decided no lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided\nBallot WCBS they got him ... his name he decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the average human as all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think the ... so this is a radio debate yes again and they're just deciding no we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be me should also be the Green Party and also the party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nWith all of this which you know roaming and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law say if you I Know what am I going I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get well okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how to use all health care will do that coming up in a\nRight in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions do true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who worked their whole life and were promised ally\nYep what do you do you see it here in Texas was your belief for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already I already happening all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so pension is a critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nIt's double Florida and Florida has more people than us\n... yes for his about eighty five billion they're more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a four to five deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad anyway you add that people always telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the ups they upended doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall sorting well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is in the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response time is not Larry's and the constitution yeah and I get
