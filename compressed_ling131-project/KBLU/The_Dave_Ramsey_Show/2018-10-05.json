can't buy life insurance on the entire group\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance or benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI it's okay to buy that it's usually if you are buying it and that was free of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for and it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in insurance world as you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or mine or heart attack and now you're not sure if\nYou get diabetes now you're not in ...\nAnd you leave that company you

recently this week a found out that uh my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are also kind of this plot to their face you know kind of found out this week with last weekend\nSo pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I gotta take some credit because I never kind of went and looked kind of a paid any attention and this is the second times about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was\nIt just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nThe hundred percent okay yeah yeah is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd the ... ah but basically she was out of control to know what to do and uh just borrowed her way into a mess and\nNeither one of you had your head and the game\nCorrect okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I can show you how\nA hundred percent um\nSpoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay well let me ask you this then I'm it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandon her or is she taking ownership for the shame the\nFact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was growing up\nYeah we we had a couple of conversations a ... for a church and we have some a murder intimate stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that to kinda get up in fact I mean I I don't want to ... you know you've got to talk to but I think that yes we accept the responsibility\nCall is very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity read but magazine to the service at thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why your marriage wasn't topping out\nI mean it can be a little white lies the target bags under the bed Snickers snake or write\nOr or it can be big time credit card debt it can be won over years running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream is turning into a nightmare\nLet me just kinda clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse [laughter] was that helpful you didn't\n[laughter] was that helpful you don't already know that that ... [laughter] yeah [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by\nEar earlier all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it goes up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly [laughter] so here's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse\nA purchase or a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaire as times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk show and hey I Want to\nBuy this toy I Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean yeah and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those who got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share in about this she gets ready to buy a person's too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys is too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to one of those guns [laughter]\nUh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money\nEven where there is not a stress on the finances\nHave it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it\nFrom you most\nOften we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling them well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is\nMultiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty condemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money in which case if that's your spouse you you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of the both of you should be involved now one of you again can carry that ministry of weight wants all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff so you probably\nBut every body ought to know where every dollar is going pretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who had almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get all I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remembering Larry King was on the air and Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] that's what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under zone Ruth these free can clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes earn a biology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the blips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her as Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegate it in business you would always inspect what you expect you'd never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nYou sit and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying 'cause she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got a grand in debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them\nAnd then and then you cry because they didn't do it right\nAfter you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave goes Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out well the rest of the show but we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years sit down\nBasic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month begins a unique budget it takes about\nTen minutes once you've been doing it a while\nBut it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation\nTenfold increase their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nTenfold they begin to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof and you'll feel like you've got to raise when you learn to do this together on paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nThe best for your phone every dollar give every dollar a name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success with an e lp\nAnd you know I think that's something that could have happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because\nWe didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans you thought how are we going to pay this off\nAre we going to get home do all these different things start a family but um you know definitely goes on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this and those pretty good ...\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will do I know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity this required cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind\nMean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was um mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that\nUm we weren't going to do that and so I had um we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was the normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nSallie Mae's going to be a room mate for life\nRight why why do people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could put this into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out every dollar had an assignment\nAnd every extra dollar went to a student loans so we were making payments like in the grand we're making payments to have to do is a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards it and we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years like and that lifestyle you know but um I Would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in the spirit um\nTo really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you kind of he had countless hours worked countless hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days for weeks and months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prepared\nState in prayer to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the pains of it was it worth it [noise] um yeah I don't know you're completely free yet good\nYou know what else should get out of this is like when you climb a wall that's that tall you kind of come away going we can free can do anything [laughter] yeah I'm going to crush\nThe strengthens me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns\nYou went out killed a drug at home and paid off four hundred and
