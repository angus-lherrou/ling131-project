satisfaction guarantee but I'd never heard of a satisfaction guaranteed that includes if\nYou screw up it's a customer screws up\nAnd you're you're not satisfied because you messed up well that's kinda like on you right not what these guys if you missed measure the blind or you pick the wrong color they'll replace it free wow\nThat satisfaction guarantee that I'm telling you shocked wide savings are happening right now let's take an additional five percent off that blanche dot com slice Ramsey tried to get the deal blinds dot com slash Ramsey Linda in Tennessee says unfortunately I allowed myself to fall\nInto the credit card game\nI have two cars were the same balance card one chargers twenty seven point nine percent approached card to charge them point nine which one do I attract first or if they're the same balances you pay off the interest rate first\nBut I think there's a bigger problem window\nThe Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks what's going on inside of you causes you to choose the words that\nYou years you need to stop talking about you're talking\nAllowed myself to fall into the credit card game no you didn't\nYou walk straight up signed up for the card there was no falling you're not a victim you walk straight up and signed up for stupid\nAnd you did it on purpose\nNo one's ever forced you to do anything they didn't have a gun at the car dealerships by a car I'm going to shoot you there was no collusion there was no extortion you weren't forced to buy a car you wanted to freaking car and you rationalize the crowd out of it\nStop lying to yourself it's one of the steps you have to take to get your life straightened out\nSo you didn't allow yourself to fall you walk straight up and signed up for stupid say it\nLike it is and they will help you in the healing process I Know 'cause I had to go through the same thing to me now is whether it's New Jersey I mean how are you\nHey Dave how are you a better than I deserve how can I help\nA person Oh thanks for taking my call 'em my question is I'm at I'm of course but actually the first one um I I make about forty to forty five ... a year\nOr I support a family of four and I wear a ... foot boat to serve if they have and get a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [noise]\nAnd um I have two friends one of them as I'm\nAsking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I think one apartment uh he thinks the other\nAnd it's going to be of course with a mortgage lonely too so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... okay well we tell folks don't have to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much\nThe shortest path to wells and peace in your finances just to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\nSo um what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both of these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of these stories is a nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners with somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your over can't pay your have is a precursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works\nBut you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology\nThomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies\nI I've [noise] through the end of my last year of school I got very turned off the actual science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything 'cause everyone should have an aunt you have experience and I don't have the experience and I\nI graduated early so I did I did summer classes and it can get internships hospitals are so tiny animal angel job or you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been\nEven doing accounting like account male any ... you know entry\nLevel stuff mhm are you there is get your foot in the door I'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you can call them and I'll tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless um I'll give you an example uh we have\nEight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year\nWe had Fifteen thousand applications\nFor those honored hires you get lost in that ...\nAnd it's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable and so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are\nEver but we would give them an interview and pull their\nPull the resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kid play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you\nTo at least to get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get off something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about you and that would be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investing or looking for at least we'll all go and get their resume out of style\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen we can all Michelle we'll help you and all this stuff is very very just falls out there but I think you can leave some\n\n[noise]\n\n\nIn the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage\nYou really think he cares about your longer money goes boy doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine but let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust in order taker\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYou know who knows I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably well for him so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one oh\nWe'll just fabulous into congratulations I guess I'm so proud ... who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you have to have the tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents ah my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely on them it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't\nReally have another planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years\nAnd stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible\nBut you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely leaned show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're getting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in more you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there is no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then need to do what he was supposed to do it let you know that there's just going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get to that and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income is much less I'm sure they know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card ... I'm ... smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense a character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this as what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good one proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story and we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be about twenty minutes and uh and outrageously generous as we\nGo along well done very very well on\nTouch down April from state College Pennsylvania hundred and eighty thousand dollars paid off in twenty two months making four Fifteen E.
