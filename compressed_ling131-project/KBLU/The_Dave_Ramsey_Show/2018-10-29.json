one broke yeah so [laughter] so the results are in\nThey collected data I'm over five hundred thousand vehicles are all I'm simmer report members and\nFrom that data they came up the results so what\nThey found in the number one thing they wanted from their words was the survey reinforces our recommendations\nOh that consumers should avoid brand new or redesign models and wait a year or two until the auto makers had a chance to work out the kinks and headaches sure did authorize you've you guys ... and we brought down and therefore but many times sometimes you just can't wait\nI'm here

rally auto parts better parts better prices every day\nDo you want to go back and they were\nThey talked a little bit about this the Asian auto makers obviously we're very strong in this report from Consumer Reports we mentioned at the beginning of the show and so Toyota Lexus leading once again this is the sixth year in a row for them to be at the top of the report\n'em so they they are and they thought there is sufficient data to do it so that was impressive and Vermont stood a move up nine spots um\nThe automaker figure it out some big problems they have their ... that was dragging down they're saying and they're M. X. five me out a road stir so they they must have\nGot their arms around are you at are you being an apologist for Nissan are no I'm not Consumer Reports of course they what'd you say five hundred dollars a month or I'm not ... yeah registered people yeah but I don't know whether they send out a survey if I send you a survey and you just had\nSomething fail on your car and you're really frustrated with it or you could be a hundred per cent honest and say oh yeah it's been a great car you to go you're I had a real for this and I also buy cigarettes ... I've seen where they show the survey though Russ they haven't they ask particular questions about you know how's your audio visual system work how does your\nYou know what's the have you had to have any extra maintenance outside of your warranty how do\nWe go back on under the hood many years remember in five or six is that people are all answering the same I mean you might be right but that would be across remember what happened with Ford when they came up with their new infotainment says in Raleigh all five or six and they got they actually went way down to the ratings because people didn't know how to use\nIt mhm that's right they hate us and you mentioned Honda when I was reading it worked hard and he was ... reliability is bogged down by some of its new and redesign models\nThe odyssey mini van had much worse than average reliability with problems including the infotainment systems and the door locking in unlocking the the RV SUV and the new accord dropped to average\nWith problems including the infotainment systems and some small interior rattles Hondas clarity line of alternative fuel cars had much worse than average reliability reporter problems included electronic glitches and so that's where Honda as a group got bogged down ... some of it coming once again from the infotainment says\nI got one of those new Hondas and I was like how do I turn the radio on there's so many as I was so just to finish and put a ball on this\nThe domestic auto makers where where they where were they act and says I'm just read\nSo just to finish and put a bowl on this the domestic auto makers where where they where\nWere they at and says I'm just reading right from their story or Ford and I I did printed this off right off the ... number one they're off the scale right now [laughter] for is the\nThis brand was the best of all the domestics but they were at Eighteen the tourists yeah we're in Eighteen or Nineteen whatever it was the tourists the oldest model and Ford's line up\nHad much better than average reliability well of course they've perfected it they've had a lot there forever well up but they usually reliable fusion dropped below average\nMainly because of problems with the ... three foot taste but infotainment screened freezing up\nThe whole thing and explore were worse than average both had some problems with the climate system and body hardware\nHere's old here's where problems are going to run in you can't just head on\nDown to your local audio store and have them throw in another after market radio when your factory\nQuits in most of the vehicles made today mhm so if you buy a car and you've got glitches in that system you\nBetter get it fixed well it's under warranty where they're responsible I'm going to spend the money on it because if you go in and say my radio is not working it may just staying at work and when they say well we'll try this will try that well that didn't work will try something else ... we'll start with a software upgrade them when I see that a lot and it's very expensive\nFears that I can only imagine that going back to what you were talking about their rushed to today the infotainment system must be the cause of the most headaches and a car manufacturer\nShannon if I came to you and said All right we're making this new car All right let's look at the infotainment system\nAnd the the young hot chick comes in he goes what we need this this and this\nAnd the the head guy goes well will slow down their slow down their son I've been in this business a long time it was he was white battleground yeah what we need this and there's no member last year we got knocked on those survey because people couldn't understand somebody only for the back room\nI\nGot to be all touch screen I hate touched me we have to have it be connected I mean just think a couple of years ago it has to be connected via Bluetooth around that area or many of them that are not another which we don't need it on our added back a volume now that uh tuning na huh\nSome cars have done very well with infotainment because they've made it we're when there's a problem you can simply just\nSimply Chris it'd be like simply you could take the cover off the dash the basil [laughter] and you can take a couple of boats out and remove the entire infotainment part and just you know you put another one in your program it boom it's\nSimply do that for all four hundred dollars out of weren't right but it's all one unit [laughter] which makes it\nBetter some of them do have three to five units that are separate and you don't want to buy all of them and put them in a program you want to know which ones bad that's where the you know plug and play and try and see what works happens and that's\nBad sir this is the top of the line Buick we need to have modern electronics son we barely need FM taking you hate colon if you're lifting we'd this this just dismantled the two thousand and Eighteen challenger was the eight and a quarter inch screen and each the radio calling if you're listening\n[laughter] eight six six five four car for one revival new here's a call that came in after hours\nEight six six five four car for one revival new here's a call that came in after hours\nHave a two thousand five week saver says thirty eight hundred three six and I just got it from a rural to passed away and it has over driving three to one and for the gear transmission years as ... I should drive that ... to\nOverdrive or three to one\nAnd then what fuels using this car I just got it you don't say were or will they just use regularly whether they ... or ... or\nWell the good thing is they have designed the cars for I met a say Thirty years that you just put that baby into that overdrive gear and you drive it it's going to take care of itself you don't have to be doing any shifting um I I might\nGive you a rare exception if you went into a crazy mountainous area and you wanted to try to use a little engine braking to slow down she didn't heat up your break so bad\nIn was that is that always been the case it seemed like when I was younger there was overdrive and you didn't use it unless you were but then there was a point where we're going to worry about an electronic\nOverdrive ... and ... most anything that had it over drive in it from Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety five forward and\nHas got enough systems in it that that vehicle is going to do as good a job shifting itself as you would do try and Emanuel engaged that shift or so especially on this oh five ... Sabre you've got an electronically shifted a transmission you just put that baby in overdrive in ... enjoy the smooth ride\nAs for the fuel you can put that in two thousand and one in a vehicle being that it's an old five so you can put anything in there from no ethanol content up to Fifteen and it'll equally and enjoy the fuel you don't have to be\nI'm concerned you're going to save some money on that card using the Fifteen and it'll keep things clean in there\nAnd it may be such a thing of the vehicle has been setting a while and it's an older car like it is with lower mileage you might want to consider a after you start using it maybe soon thereafter\nReplacing the fuel filter it does it needs to be done anyway you know is there may be some residue that that hire local content will clean out of the system so that car will adapt and run just fine with it\nWe're going to take a quick break you're listening to the under the hood show with the motor medics the under the hood show can be heard each week on great stations across the country had that under the hood show dot com\nUnder the hood has a new favorite tool for detailing our vehicles the brush hero but it has a ton of other uses to its water powered so it's safe for you even under water clean your boat daughters citing virtually anything you would clean with a brush\nBrush hero tackles easily I Love you usually get on my own truck wheels because they no longer cut up my hands the way I used to every time I wash them with a rag find out more about Russia hero at brush hero dot com that's brush hero dot com\nEd Koch star they repair hundreds of different makes an models but the name on the car isn't nearly as important as the name of the person who owns it because they ... they don't just repair cars they repair your car there's only one like it in the world\nWhich was that round seven eight thousand mile range for the light but they couldn't provided\nAnd unfortunately I Can't believe the number of people that come in and we change their oil we look at the old sticker as we pull it off to put the new one on and we say hey I I noticed your eight thousand miles over\nThe four thousand that was put on your sticker before is did you have a change somewhere else no I just hadn't got around to change it he's er engines that are very sensitive to oil changes Chris what they would be they should\nBe taken care of high feature high technical agents that does that help you out a feature high technical oil Kyle did we answer your question\nOh you did I was just go out and that's what I posted on the Facebook page a I have an acquired they ah Ninety nine forty four with the five oh and the ... the forty head low it that for truck once that motor does go it's getting a five oh conversion\nAnd will be fun that'd be really fun Kyle thanks very much for the call eight six six five nine for for one final and thanks for listening on ... ... exactly into let's Dr Larry Larry you're on the end of the who'd show what can we do for ya\nI've got a Ninety three ... and ah [noise] yeah I'm Out [noise] and I was wondering how hard they are decaying\nFuel pumps that one I have ... as far as I Know I've never seen the door in that it's like an ex Jay six yeah\nAnd I think that I don't know I'd rather than the option to grow their own I don't know much about it and I started right and that's the other day and I'm from ... now that that's why I like it and\nYou you might get fortunate on this I'm just trying to think we've dismantled a few of these through the years some of them have Monday I see I think some of them you can remove the backseat area and they had a ...\nTo ... door yeah adore a plate hatch they'll give you access to the fuel pump I'm just I'm about positive I remember seeing that in in one that we had to go fifty fifty because I'm thinking no one this model\nI I'm just I'm about positive I remember seeing that in in one or that we had so it could go fifty fifty\nBecause I'm thinking no on this model Shannon's thinking ... most likely yeah you could go either way\nBut it but I'm sure a resource would be available at once you go through the the uh like we have a ... Michel system at our shop a lot of shops have an all data system I mean there's different ways they do it but most all of them in their procedure manual if there is an access door they're going to tell you there's an access door\nAnd uh that makes the job a lot easier but what that doesn't do is make the fuel pump any less expensive\nSome of the British and European stuff\nIs quite expensive to get parts for if it is it something that's still in the mainstream where the after market is came in and contributed because I see that in our part side of the business that sometimes will buy a\nMid year British brand or European brand\nAnd we know that we're gonna be all ... parts of that longer even though not all ... then we would on like a domestic sure would cause people will hold onto them longer right and the cost of the parts doesn't go down as they get older\nIf it was a eight hundred dollar fuel pump from jaguar when it was new it's still an eight hundred dollar field jaguar when insult\nUm but there again there could be a\nA seat belt buckle replacement I mean it's just hard to tell who originally made that maybe it was a ... pump originally and Bosh has a after market replacement that is still an oldie equivalent so you just got to ask the questions and and then the final question you always got to ask yourself\nIs it really the fuel pump I mean do you write the fuel pump\nThat that that ... and when you're getting into eight hundred that's not something you want to you want to know for sure right you want to have done some testing is that something where I Would bring it to my local shop and they would be able do would you be able to go out and find out what kind of pump it needs and all that\nYeah you will you first step is to test it and verify that it's actually bad and ... and get messed with to repair the car we verify yes the pump is bad All right we've done that part of the testing it's gonna cost this much and a pump installed will be this price\nLarry thanks very much for the call good luck\nI was thinking that might be kind of fun to own a jaguar even though when they bring you know you got for for the while it works it would be fun but then I remembered I have a Jew Fox which is exactly\nThe same taken out of those six range rover so we'll see how this goes said you boxes exactly the same as a jaguar works great for a while and then when it doesn't it's a headache to get fixed because it weighs Eighteen thousand fans who you're listening to the show we'll be back\nIn just a minute [noise]\n... a long time always supplier is the leader in automotive thermostats and fuel oil and Kuhn caps motor red state of the art quality control and functional testing systems ensure high quality long lasting products as cooling system experts motor red delivers world class product development\nProviding all the parts that accessories needed to do the job right the first time\nEvery time motor red offers the best coverage of thermostats enclosure caps in the world for virtually any vehicle an engine on or off the road motor at leading the way in coverage and service\nDo you hear a tap tap tap sticky vows and lifters under your hood left on touch this could cause an expensive repair bill during normal operation of your engine gums and varnish is form inside causing the vows and lifters to stick\nOut a can of justice brothers engine tune up and totally eliminate sticky vows and lifters now justice brothers engine tune ups detergent action cleans the inside of the engine while reducing metal metal friction why put up with the embarrassing tapping of sticky vows lifters try a can of justice brothers engine tune up today\nYou know one in five Americans haven't disability that the new nation\nYou know today\nDid you know one in five Americans have a disability that the new nation wide screen Campbell letting you know you can help American with a disability obtained a freedom\nFry an independent getting back into the workplace\nSpread the message of in the in the ... is the leader in place in Americans with disabilities and disabled veterans back into the workplace you know someone who is disabled and would like to get back to work contact in the er at age seven seven to\nEight to eight seven seven or eight [noise] eight and a one to go online and in the\nCentral done in the ...

party is shift completely in twenty oh six Obama voted for a border fence that didn't Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer like twelve years ago the Democratic party wanted border fences to be built\nThey wanted illegal was out of the country when they started losing elections they figure it out well let's make Texas a blue state\nLet's flood taxes with the illegals make them legal to vote and then we can win Texas ... wins taxes and that guy is a fool and a clown over Ted Cruz something is wrong in Texas\nIf Texas becomes a blue state Republicans will never again when the presidency\nAnd let's continue with more coming up in about six minutes NYPD retired officer\nInvestigator detective Thomas Redskins will be here to talk about the investigation of what happened in Pittsburgh later on a Sam Nunberg will be here works with Steve Bannon on his way out to Nevada to talk about the Trump media a respect or lack there up by CNN later on as David re a fair federation of American immigration\nReform to talk about the medical conditions happening on the southern border and more aligned becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven\n... other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews and against African Americans every several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go but right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven magnitude since and blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still trying to think down and see what it is\nA him someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns now isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope being from the polish Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint that you would have gotten a call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop\nGene then it's on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours showed anything\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized that he was becoming what we call lone wolf\nAnd they was going to do something other than his ramps till right before you went in yesterday when he said I'm going in and if police knew about ... that'll come to light if they didn't then why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\nCommissioner asking you some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him in the nation at three hundred and forty million people ... and let's face it in America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth\nAnd this is the place or were were were were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful you know it's a faith and family because the connections to go some hard work because of academics disproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionally succeed in business and entertainment in finance and the law in Madison and I found it so it last year it said that\nThis afternoon on CNN there was an interview of a doctor\nWho treated Bowers who unfortunately lived in that doctor is Jewish\nAt the Pittsburgh hospital in a couple of the nurses who treated him and saved his life were Jewish ... isn't that unbelievable that ... that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould have been a Jewish cop who responded to the synagogue to to save other people people in their\nProfession to be doctors lawyers or in the emergency areas being doctors police officers firemen don't look at who they're saving or what they've done\nThey know what they're sworn to do and that's what they do and that's what the doctors in that hospital even though he had killed eleven Jewish people innocent a God who ... their prey\nSaved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what firemen do and that's what these doctors did and God Bless them for that\nWas talking about the summer say who was the\nMentally ill deranged individual they ran around in the white van I guess his band was he was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man\nHas those kind of a a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes on Hillary Clinton in bronco bomber that's something should have been done in your years in New York City as a cop Thomas ...\nHow many unusual situations like that did you observe\nMore than I can count but I Will tell you this you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them\nAnd maybe he didn't violate the law the\nFact that he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right\nTo pull him over and or a question in my last he violates some other kind of law and then we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him relative to his fan as of yet down there but you know at the point in time I'm sure\nWhere it went down to about ... aka\nA Florida with the bombs had been sent proved that distribution center and then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start\nPrior to the police come into contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print and that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying\nShy or is the potential bomber\nAnd you know these acts of terror are taking place sadly quite frequently just on Wednesday\nHey criminal who sent a rise in like materials\nTo the home of US Senator Susan Collins was arraigned on the Trump children the adult children have received numerous\nNumerous rise in on a attempted it looked like rise in and blows with powder in the mail including us defense secretary James Madison practically every\nHigh ranking Trump official has been threatened with death because Ted Cruz and others changed completely out of restaurants you had Senator Mitch McConnell in Louisville, Kentucky chased out of a restaurant\nYou have a ... a United States are congressmen and Republican\nIn uh in California had a switch blade pulled on attempted to stab him running for the Congress the candidate clobbered that would be assassin before the man could get the blade out of a malfunctioning knife\nThere are numerous examples in the last several months where powder scent where are the candidates are sent with their heads decapitated\n... and I I Can't recall a time other than the late Nineteen sixty sixty eight when the country repaired almost to be to be coming apart the Drudge Report says that the usa on edge do have a sense that something is different about the political climate now than it's been years ago Thomas ...\nOh yeah the rhetoric on both sides of the have become this rural and have become terrible and we have to dial it back I mean I've said in numerous appearances recently that if this continues on a leash or going to be busier than they've ever been before it's not\nJust Donald Trump and not just the right is for everyone has to understand the McCain way of thinking that we have to work together we can have our political views and we can look at things\nFrom different lenses that are different experiences and how we were growing up but we're all Americans we're not able to work with each other or help each other or save each other the way that they do after a hurricane and the way the police officers around this country to every single day\nThey don't look at the color or the religion or the person that they're saving they respond because that's what they wanted to do and they risk their lives to save anyone that they potentially could save because that's what they're calling\nI I don't know I like the president I I Love the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he he's a great political character I look at his results\nMore than look at his words but I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines of the words and they used as president then I hear on the left but the media covers the Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words\nAnd uh and I I Wish there was a quality between the two but as you said the election now is only a little more than a week away and at this point it would behoove all of us to lower down the ready rhetoric a little bit because there's hundreds of thousands on the left and on the right\nNow they're waiting to be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom Russ get needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution\nBut it does mean that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible for almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald\nWell for almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even though he's the only president in American history there Jewish\nGrandchildren the only one in today's CNN tried to tee up to us and Israeli ambassador the as the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had has been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful\nFor Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said that it's time to lower the writer rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept that in fact CNN and the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Yuma", "day": "29"}
