eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Tony how can how\nCan a thank you for taking my call so I'm about five years and see my career field in IT in cyber security and um I currently make\nA hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed a all of these baby stopped so I don't have a wife or kids\nAre and then this past Oh yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable either and uh being full time\nAnd it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a hybrid air to control thing and\nAh I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you could go and five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and uh but\nI I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know I don't have to support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either saying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome uh the the field itself I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going the job but like a Chihuahua or anything like that I I and I enjoy it so yeah I'm a opportunity to ah to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work that out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so it's consulting so I you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to be three hundred K. that's pretty clear direct\n... that that's even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\nOr ... ... ... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position on 'em and they they say that that's about average um yeah OK yet but they they've had some months for they they get a paycheck and\nYou know but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat that Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty you know ...\nWith by her position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stacked up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it but let's say\nLive on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where he can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I ... to celebrate tonight my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the ... love to be worked ... right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same as not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go\nOh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five this was a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for dates go to Rachel he's on line and Madison, Wisconsin right talking about\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now I'm working in the legal industry I'm but I'm not a lawyer my role and they're catching coordinators so basically I'm working with different more to help coordinate their program Dr Engel\nMy ankle ... however I don't want to work in lido administration I Want to work in a different industry\n... thing my current job would get me transferable skills how line should I stay and well let's lay down job ... and if I only stay wind a two year the next protection\nYou know you almost like a job hopping at all how old are you a twenty four\nOkay twenty four I forgot to write that down so here's the deal you're pretty much the average millennials who looks at a job we knew this from data\nThat looks at a job is no more than about twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping you left after six months you've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specifically where do you want to go so congratulations being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up so uh the first question you asked me are your skills\nThat you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nStew a quick example here tell me a two or three or four things that you do really well right now in your job if I interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go\nUm I Would say it's down there and and conferences and then\nProbably author collaboration or one of my big wrong very big jogger to figure out who is doing what program and then on the other side of of a nation or a man who is doing something similar and then kind of match them together and figure out how to hit the ball rolling traction\nYeah uh everybody in America as well so that going wow that's extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick the industry\nI mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I tell my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available than there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems in processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members that's extremely valuable I Believe there are people listen to the show right now we're going I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd interviewer tomorrow\nSo you need to have terrific confidence there now you asked me a resin\nExperience out there you're you're twenty four years old so they take that into account you don't have a Fifteen year work history you're twenty four mhm and as long as you are open and honest as to why you're moving I think a a solid hiring managers going to ask you why are you interested in working here and you just tell them\nHey I I was in the space I really have a love of administration I Love meeting people and systems and here's why I Want to be here\nAnd so I'm Rachel I Want you to go to Ken Coleman dot com okay right now and download my free resume resource\nIf you haven't already we've had over twenty five thousand people download this just in the last few weeks and we actually address what you're talking about right here what should my resume look like water hiring managers looking for the average average hiring managers spending ready\nFor this less than a minute six to sixty seconds looking at a resume\nSo it's not as important as you think it is what is important relationships in in this resume guys I'll teach you\nHow to structure your resume show you an example tell you why to do it that way how to use relationships ... wants to get you that\nIt's not as scary as you say to get a creative resonate exposure and it's got to be attached to a relationship\nThey don't care how important they just want to can you help me win [noise] what hiring managers or\nDon't go anywhere more of your calls in before we receive our\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your path\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and working I grow up what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there is not a fulltime job available because Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just shadow you for a day\nI'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nIn those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places\nSo again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you he needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention allergy and some ... that's all it takes\nTriple eight to five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line in Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nBut he can big fan big fan of the whole rest of the organization appreciate all you do thank you\n[laughter] okay so um I look at it I I I'm kind of continues you know what I'm Wondering if if what I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story now that's a good a job that excellent benefits to pursue at that with my passion I take about ... percent pay cut to make the switch\nAnd and I went to this new profession you know I'm I'm quickly right in that I don't know if the right thing for me I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get them in fact probably\nWell tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick run\nAnd then today are basically just knock out bookstores who I Am what I Do and you know try and get them to meet with me so that I can help him with a retirement plan and education so are you working for a local firmer gee open up your own shop\nNo it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead\nOkay why did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause in playing financially but your question was is this hobby level you know it's just the right thing for me and and and and I you know there is a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nWhy did you jump for this why financial planning\nSo you know I've been with the day for the last five ten years crowded and you know I've always had a passion for maybe that would help folks were the financial planning out retirement\nOr when I went to a very you know to kind of holding my story you know that you're given like a great and um you know just just you know trucks came across a ... I went with it in a shift that it's not working out\nWell did you plan financially from this\nAh somewhat you know I had about three to six months of expenses which is a quickly depleted ... and uh you know I thought I was gonna you know and I never got that always had I've always excelled so you know I thought that's really no different go in you know kill it you know and and and uh you know I look more on commission\nHave human animal well here here out the way\nHere's the situation you went after a a financial advisor role\nThat's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances with the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't know if straight commission sales is the thing for you\nThe reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders are and maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this isn't working in pretty quickly you got to make a decision on and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe not the right place because he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching\n'em and you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format the right setting to be able to do that so we get some feedback reassess let's get stable and find a better scenario but don't stop moving [noise] AAA\nEight to

what's the best way for them to go about that\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child and e essay and educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in the\nUm they haven't really decided a but growing up I was giving savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I could I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure\nOkay All right well you can open some mutual funds as little as two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of that you can't be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nOK you can in a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred

I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of listening to actually have a few dollars truck together\nGreat um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that I'm as an Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that\nBut that calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars of factors mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand jumps cash flow and get something my salary mhm\nWhat are the penalties for growing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for ...\nYeah it's about fifty first up ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEmpire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand of picky picky and fifty thousand a put into that I can rebuild my return my emergency founded about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is a cushion right and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty okay so what is three to six months of expensive\n\nIt is about twenty three thousand\nOkay that would be ... that'd be three months or six months that will be ... okay\nOut on my own cash because you've funded this thing\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars than the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund\nTo fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper miles thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money and retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies and don't monkey with it\nIs merge and she found this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally\nGiven the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around and so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nHey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you and makes me want to really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of fitness that maybe you're biased on the best business model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd it can be done but uh coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do ...\nSo that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're showing some on a home near coaching them into this house is going to you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission as a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore\nThat angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in
