Iran where they bring the outside receiver in motion underneath the shotgun information and the quarterback kind of pitches it forward for a little shoveled paths and turned into a six year again\nOn second floor it's another pitch to number twenty Zeke Rio's as he tries to stretch for the first down it's going to be close to meeting on where they caught the ball he needed to get to the forty five yard line\nAnd it's going to be spotted pretty close to that maybe about six inches shorter they'll probably bring out the change to measure here on second down a good run from Rio's again on another pitch from his starting quarterback heath of our views on like I said they are going to measure bringing out the chains\nThey got a march I'm clear across the field in high school football the chains are on the far side line and the ball is you're on the near side hash marks\nThey're going to see where they need to mark as if it's going to be third down or another first a gym with ten minutes\nThe near side hash marks\nThey're going to see where they need to mark as if it's gonna be third down or another first in tune with ten minutes to go here in the first quarter\nSo we have yet to see our visa ... back to pass yet obviously that had one pass a template that sell path but it's a\nThan a ... a little bit of a different look from civil\nAnd trying to establish the run and it was a real is on that place looked at me first and then from the forty five had to buy the nose\nOf the football bowl or using a lot of momentum you're trying to gain more territory further into the rich territory at the forty five yard line the ten minutes and eleven seconds to go here in the first quarter getting that play call from the sideline like we've seen multiple times before\nThe entire office checking their wrist bands for the play and RVs is going to be back in the shotgun with one of the backfield\nWedding on to snap he's got Ramirez in motion fake sand off now he gives it to Rio's who's ... and the backfield buy fewer ridge\nFor a loss of yards there are multiple either ridge talks on the ... good defense of coverage\nOf the first guy there was Wyatt Robin saying he ... a snare real spirit to yard loss and you know that he's a rich defensive line led by guys like this and um have has been strong all year we also got to keep an eye on the line backer the Angela Garcia\nWho's a just may play after play all year forcing turnovers making plays in the backfield I think those are two guys for sure that are going to be key along he reaches front seven\nSo here on second whoa we see our visa take the snap in the backfield as Rios he handed off immediately cheerios he's passed the original line of scrimmage now down to the forty\nTo gain guards there on second down to bring up about Thirteen ... for for civil law so good recovery play after a year the ridge had a good defense of stop there on first down\nCivil or responds with a good run from Rio's to bring up started\nPoor areas on his first for the averaging just over four yards of pop and that's something that's really important for civil as much as they like to go vertical and the passing game to establish the run early they steak that shovel past there and gave it away to Rio's and he was able to pick up about eight\nYet to see a true passed down field receive third and fourth eight minutes and thirty seconds to go wind up on the near side hash marks\nRVs that takes it and it's another pitch to Rio's he tries to get around the outside he breaks the first act we've got the first down now he's down to the thirty before he's taken down on the far side line a good run there from Rio's to break that first apple they just had him by the ankles he was able to hide stuff with a little bit get around the outside of\nThe line of scrimmage to move to change to bring up first and Gen forcible\nFantastic seat by real seeing able to slip through a tackle on the edge to escape from what would have been about no gain and he turned the corner ended up with a gain of about seven and a first down again first of all of their third of the drive\nThey're going to line up on the ... ridge thirty one yard line moving left to right with eight minutes to go here and the first quarter they're lined up on the far side of the field this time RVs is still in the backfield with Rios\nSakes they hand off it's a pass the number nine Gabriel cats the NATO completed and you get past the original line of scrimmage sidestepped the initial tackle\nAnd it gets another artist you after that should be just shy of the first\nDown it's going to be second down and about a yard\nHere for civil a\nSecond down and for skews me I was looking at the wrong yard marker they're\n\nA lot closer from up here in the press box\nSo here we are second for was seven minutes and twenty five seconds to go\nThey go bunch right\nDown [noise]\nIt's gonna be holding call against both sides going to back them up it would have been good enough for the first down it was going to back them up here\n\nAgain that's something coach he's talked about in the pre game you gotta take care of your possessions and take care of the ball so you know that they've made a pretty good march don't feel so far without any penalty calls but\nYou want to keep that up\nSeven minutes now to go in the first quarter\nBall was march on the he's a rich thirty or line to bring up a second and about nine and a half [noise]\nReach interests with that spot getting a call here\nFrom the sidelines civil awaiting taking their time now they were kind of I don't want to say they were in a hurry up often but they were moving along pretty quickly and now they've slowed down just a tight and they don't\nHuddled traditionally they all look to the sideline and that that not running\nTraditional hurry up the snapped RVs though it's another hand off to Rio's who gets to the line of scrimmage still pushing as he's piled up by about four he talks and it's still going to come up shy of the first down\nDevon Graham was the first guy there that held up real ... real was still able to drive forward for picking you know he got contacted the twenty five you're winds up being dropped down at the twenty three he's about four or five blocks\nAs good as you can really see the leg strength there from a runner when they're bombarded by three or four defenders and they keep pushing and they move the entire pile forward to here we are on third and two time moving pretty quickly here in the first quarter six minutes to go\nAnd this is what you want to do if you're a civil as offensively hasn't been their strong suit all year they've been more of an offensive joke or not you know times at least and they possess the ball for half the first quarter so far on this drive\nThe snap to our visa though it's another hand out to Rio's he's getting a lot of action here tonight but this time he met in the back for a big lots of yard to bring up for down one of the first ones there was time or a nose linebacker for healer ridge he was all over that and he read exactly where Rios was going and they didn't let him get there\nAcross the field out of bounds of the one about as fortunate of a role or bounce that you could get for the ha\nSo here we are first in in defense of all territory are reader takes his nap\nIt's a quick pitch to re I was just trying to get out of the end zone and he does and then they're going to stop this or we're just barely they're going to stop this\nFor progress at about the one yard line so as I did not expect that play call there from ... if you're that deep for why the pitch even further into your into your AIPAC operate\nOut of the shot down a pistol I'm quite a bit but they haven't they've shown that they will run its own way and some direct hand off\nPitch and trying to get outside there is a risky play especially when the runners getting of all about six or seven yards end of the end zone he's got to cover a lot of ground to get out RVs isn't a pistol again we'll see what the college here\nTakes the snap hands that directly off to Rio's this time he gets a little bit of breathing room he's out to the five and then he finally taken down at about the seven yard line so gives the ball a little bit more breathing\nRoom to bring up\nThird and about one\nThird and one in long close to thirty two but we'll call it thirty wants a little bit more breathing room here they're out of their own end zone still tend to very deep in their own territory with thirty seconds to go in the first quarter the ball's gonna be marked ride it about the\nNine yard line\n... taking a little bit more time now they're lined up here on the near side of ...\nThe last play the first quarter presumably it's a huge chance for civil uh to uh try to flip the opposition a little bit and I think we're getting off sides on the rich\nOr his penalty call with twelve seconds to go there trying to get the heart account and it worked\nCivil though there is a healer richest trying to get the jump on it to make a play and so it's going to be offset against them so it's going to be a little bit more breathing room forcible and that's exactly what you want with twelve seconds to go it's going to be a first down at the Fifteen yard line\nOr reserve takes his nap and it's ... to Rio she tries to get around the outside of the line of scrimmage he's still trying to push forward and he's going to be taken down at about the\nSeventeen yard line before the quarter runs out so to bring up a second down for

we might have to change it just a little bit there's a war will make your word so very quick moving first quarter there still zero zero at the start of the second and like we said Eric so far it's been pretty evenly matched and this is exactly what we thought we'd get\nAn you know let's go back to the previous or down into converted the ball is inside that one there Ninety nine yards away from their own end zone just getting that first down alone isn't some breathing room and allows them to get out of the shadow of their own goalpost\nSo here we are second five from the twenty yard line we switch sides of the field the right at the snap it's going to be a false start against a symbol of so after a couple of good place to give them some breathing room and keep the clock running they are going to move back a little bit to bring a second can from their own in the yard line\nAfter that quarter we switch ends of the field\nNow civil is moving right to left on your diet or as you're looking at it from the grandstand with just under twelve minutes played only a second ran off at the clock so it's going to be second Fifteen from the Fifteen guidelines gives me I said ten yard

playing outside linebacker and then a couple of defensive backs who are fairly tall as well or any after him and he uh untied heart that's a problem could be problematic protein that likes to throw it

and fifty seconds to go coming out of a timeout wind up on the fire hash marks for civil law\nWe're going to see quarterback he can our veto and his final game as a civil raider take to snap\nBack to pass he drops back he's under pressure he gets away from the first athletes trying to get through he's being chased down he's still got behind the line of scrimmage right now he touched it in four to run themselves who looks like it's going to be close close to the first down we'll see where he slid there he needed to get to the twenty five yard line\nAnd he was like I said he was under pressure healer ridge one of the first ones there was a number of sixty eight or she is the number sixty nine\n... it was a ... ram was close to them and he was able to get away and you know our visas always looking down field and it looks like he was about a half a yard short its fourth down and civil is going to hunt or because they're so deep for their own to\nProbably a safe conservative call there like you said deepen their own territory after twenty five yard line if you go for it and don't get it you said he would reject with great field position nobody back to receive for Hua ridge\nBut the

I don't know about you but when they went for for the two point conversion\nI questioned it just a little because I I I've only been a coach for a few little league sports in my time so you know I'm not a I'm not as good as the coaches are coach RV though that's for sure\nBut I've always had the mindset of\nSome points on the board are better than no points so when you have a chance to hire or go for the lead\nIt the conservative easy call is always to tie up but they went for the lead and ended up being able to work out and civil and was able to hold them down hold their meetings you rich down towards their own goal line if you're rich they came out very strong in the second half\nBut together some very good drives to take the lead early in the second half to make a fourteen to seven right\nYeah and um then they were able to strike again to make your Twenty one fourteen so just uh\nIf you're a Super Bowl a\nView there's you're nothing be sad about here you're you're happy about

bit conservative but when it's the last game of the year\nYou're at home you sort of over to your players to play for the win in that situation you're right you're right in that circumstance I think that that's what you're going for your you're sending your seniors you're sending your team\nOut into life and the high school football coach um and you kind of have a responsibility to show that you've got to take some chances in in life and that's what the coach RV so did a really gutsy play it paid off it was the right call as it turned out in the defense\nWho played very well and the first quarter and a half\nSort of had the band and bend in band and they didn't break on that final drive a capitalizing on a couple of misused by the hawks with a hawk slate of well\nI mean which is under state it in a one point game and it's a it's about as good of a season as either rage has had in their school history they were hopefully in there for them it's going to get to the playoffs for the
