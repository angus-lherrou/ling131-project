better or no doubt if you get the bill from the credit card company you say I didn't sign it I had no idea this existed we've been separated since ah X. period of time this application was in ... I'm not responsible and they will take you off you'll be okay\nOkay okay Nicaragua on why would anybody move to Nicaragua\nHi Kelly\nYeah I think that my daughter has a toy Yoda and it had a she got to recall notice or the airbag the airbags we all know about that explode\nAnd shrapnel and she took it in to the dealer who did it take care of them they said there is nothing they can do they have no\nThing and for that time dean which indefinite can adjust how nobody in her car\nYeah that's what they do Kelly because nothing you can do well here's the problem there five million of those of you Kelly\nUh-huh and uh so we're in line are you let's say you're the third millions person that walk in\nOkay they probably don't have thousands of airbags sitting in the back they can replace it correct\nAnd that's the problem so why you have to you know how does that work do you have to find out where in line I'd go back to the dealer and say here's the recall and I'm assuming it's a ... an airbag correct\nI'm guessing yeah yeah the ticket and\nI don't know if you want I contacted to knock of people I Would contact lawyers involved with those people\nAnd I would go back to the dealer and said is there a time is there an estimated time when uh I my car will be be able to be fixed and they can say talk has never been told us when it is we know we have a recall we know they said they're replacing the bags\nBut again Kelly there's five million people that have your problem\nOkay they actually told her there was no solution then\nNo no no no that's not true they can replace the airbag well that's that's the\nProblem we're having to go to another and go to Kelly go to another dealer okay\nYeah you can go to any yeah you can go to any deal or a dad that so that that that doesn't that you're flying on that\nAlan Hi Alan\nHey there on the show thank you\nOr I read the actual contractor question yes if a homeowner refuses to pay the balance on a home improvement contract does the word guarantee or warranty still remain in effect\nThat's a good question and I would say the no because there was a breach of contract going on and therefore there is no contract at all so interesting including the war in tea once there was a breach ban everything is off the table\nOh interesting okay is that a specific California\nI don't you know I I'll frankly I don't know because I just made it up [laughter] so it's [laughter] me making it up is specific to California but me making up is probably across the country but I think I'm right on that one\nYeah okay I'll check it out yeah please you know what I'm saying that\nCame up in a a you know it was in the show all the time I'm like man that's the perfect question\nFor you know it is and it'd be great if I knew about it yeah it would be wonderful and I should because I used to be a contractor\nSo or see it all works out Matt Hi Matt you're up welcome to handle on a law Matt you there I'm here Yes sir\n[noise] okay I have had a house that I sold on payments that burned down in ... California fires the blue cut fire [noise] about three months ago I was effectively the bank [noise]\nOh no you know so you you you can't read back paper on it\nI carried back paper on cocaine and so the\nHouse [noise] one of the house burned down in the fires they did have insurance I was listed as as the additionally insert right now it's up\nTo my surprise which I found interesting\nIn concerns company says they're going to issue one shack for the total loss in both my name and the homebuyer Johnny absurd name\nAnd it's up to us to fight it out now I agree that I'm not going to side of the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to signing the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious\nOh I agree that I'm not going to side of the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to signing the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious position\nWell and I I don't know if it does or not it probably leaves them in a precarious position 'cause they have to live someplace and you're still okay and so you you can do a couple of things on this one All right you can\nAsk for a mediator\nWhere are you guys pay for a mediator to work this out in a mediator who has experience in construction law\nMediators are generally attorneys who specialize in this field and then just sit down and work it out over a few hours that's one if it turns out that they're not willing to really sit down then what you do is you file a lawsuit for the money\nAnd then you do in ... you actually enter plead the money with the court\nSo here's a lawsuit to the court hears the check now let's go to work and the judge will make that decision\nAnd the judge will issue in order and effectively the judge will sign the check on your behalf pursuant to a court order\nSo it's either a now down a mediator or a lawsuit okay and looming and looking in the mirror my friend and saying why the hell that I hold back and take paper\nTelling me about it okay let me do it again you look in the mirror and you say why held at night just get my money out of that and let them make payments to me okay so we've done ... go ahead\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know\nWhy would you marry someone who is such an auditor flake that he hasn't filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pays taxes haven't filed attack\nHow he'll wait a second just write the check to the IRS no I don't\nKnow I mean that has come out of a ... nothing like that he does all that he just had to file that site yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think of you know maybe\nBut I'm just wondering if I marry him and my response all\nHell you're only responsible for being stupid\nAnd I'm like yeah well that's a given but I Know I mentioned part that I Love you and I'm not saying\nThat either you see the will lessen well we can have that conversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who is financial issues\nJust keep everything separate everything separate and I and and what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checks out of\nThe mortgage or a gardeners or utility bills or whatever\nAnd so that is the clean his weight now as far as he is concerned having pay the taxes and not filing a tax return now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal\nThe IRS doesn't really care he just file their taxes and you may even be entitled to he may even be entitled to refund so I even though the violation and it's one of those and\nNot paying taxes they get very upset\nYeah you know he painted and then you're fine but then just say hey I didn't follow the taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't remember and I woke up and I have a long beard and ripped family go on it for whatever but uh I haven't gone to an accountant filed and taxes dammit and get a refund\nOkay I've often yeah okay yeah you're an idiot primary\nHighly\nAh Michael hello Michael a welcome to handle on the

the amount of paid in insurance and I don't even know if you do that with uh the feds when filing an IRS a return if you talk about the amount of money that you've paid in credit card debt\nOr whether or not you have negotiated a lesser payment for the bottom line is that yes that's considered income\nBut it's considered income over the three years so it's what sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a

has ah been going back and forth between my house than his father lived with me and his mother how and now he just turned Seventeen he says he doesn't want to go back with her he finally it\nYou know having courage and he said he's not going back and it's\nOkay you know try to convince them that what's your question so can he stay without sure that the cars\nI mean what's your ... and you know here's the point is she going to go into court and ask for custody of a Seventeen year old I mean that's raising and windows how how many months ... days is he a going to be turning Eighteen from this phone call\nWhile he just turned ... he just\nTurned okay so he just turned Seventeen believe me I'm a mom could go into court asked for custody and Seventeen year old son goes I you know what I don't want to live with\nMy mother it's over\nI wouldn't I wouldn't bother now she could file for custody just make make yours and his life miserable\nOh he's done that for all the here\nWell then you have to then what ... what happens is I she he well he can also years a couple of other things you do okay thing number one is uh that\nI she filed against the father asking for sole custody and the court is going to say about what's this about will ask your all will ask your grandson he could also argue to being emancipated minor\nAnd it's done and it's done at Seventeen I think the corps to give it to him\nCan he do that if he doesn't have a job\nYeah OK of course all of course\nThat you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I

is if you aren't passing time you're out of luck so the trick is for you to contact the state\nDepartment of industrial relation there's a whole section\nOf a there's a whole section involved with wage enforcement and you can look on the website they'll have a state of California and then at the department of natural relations and then frequently asked questions or there'll be some somewhere there they don't talk about a statute\nOkay [noise] yeah um can I can I ask you sure the question is if we assume that just somebody told me it was three years okay it could be if we assume\nThat um you know I'm with\nOne of the things about it is um during the last six months that I work was eighty hours a week um the the management wife a pass away that's all I stepped in and basically uh just
