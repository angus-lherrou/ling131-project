to\nBe a a mother fascinating time in in our history to see where this goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look at you you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent as a time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely awful they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are better dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is pay wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election\nWe have to wait until after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right and this is

I started laughing because\nYou know that has been going to happen you have to point out and and I believe at times you have to get blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabinet hearing said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were ... Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not accord a lot it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that\nHad much of the same enforcement mechanisms that are criminal court has\nWhen you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence if you're\nNot on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way as you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well I you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody there not a patriot because they believe they're a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American if we want makes you want to America and it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject it\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say you right it's it's not and people said well it's a shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech will know you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted and\nAnd so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for and\nThe fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country ...\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the way in the\n... move onto the next when well again I Want\nTo win for calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're

that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not promote\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't

there a politician in American aimed at where I'm I'm guessing if that's your name you you might want to change it and most have\nBut um but this is the he's a tactic and yes from the left that's the tactic and if you engage they're going to engage even further and we see that that that's very evident now\nI'm with this current brought it but as we've said with with Trump Trump visited them with what he's actually done and it's interesting because I had a discussion last week with a friend that I've known for Thirty years now\nAnd she claims that she's a liberal whenever I talk to her I find the she agrees much more with me that that it surprises me when we ... we only see each other once every couple of years we sat down we had to talk\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I was greatly United but over an issue\nI in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh\nThat to me that to me deal is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it couldn't be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know if ... if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west or just to turn some of those districts ah or to just keep people at home\nI don't even know that it will you know change your vote from right to laugh at the people but if you

Berkeley I'm not on the health care but on border control they would say\nNo people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it\nAnd this is the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left ...\n... ... and this device I'd get to the president as Mr President people already know what you think and forget about what have you ever wish you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continue to ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer out of Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue\nOr ... I mean winter lose the house and joins ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats mhm\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the press is act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since really ... when William was that was\nThat two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board no was while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam dusty um yes it was because it was two thousand aids\nWas two thousand and it was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here was one of our personnel and\nAnd then then it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was that the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that ah he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\n\nThat uh and it fell short on a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low I remember going weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so\nThe ... the but\nThis has been going on for a long long time if you think about it and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it\nBut it's been over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue huge issue is that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold\nAs a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I\nWant to do for your goals six six months he wrote on radio [noise]\n\nMister show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day but it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that threat I radio show dot com cobra electronics\nThese private before the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America\nCenter to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives for breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to lose proactively for every radio snowman who makes it a donation device thinking the fight against answer the right to the radio was available for a limited time\n... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nWhat does it mean to the corner office well the seat behind the wheel of a new free ... and the prestige of the corner office takes on a whole new meaning to sleep designed to be ergonomics dash\nLarge LCD display controls at your fingertips hauled create a more comfortable functional workspace that set you up for success to take a virtual tour of your next office space visit freight line or dot com slash corner office that's free lighter dot com slash corner office free lighter runs smart", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "27"}
