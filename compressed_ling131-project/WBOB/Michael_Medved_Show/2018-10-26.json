Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous oh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and wool Mart and everything else and people are jumping aboard this crap but it's pure crap and you buy into it\nSeparate yourself from those idiots over their\nDeal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the true not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world because everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter] well I mean we're we're just going to start with I I never forget the I'll never forget that moment in\nA jade helm ... Fifteen when you know it was the night we\n\nUnderstand where we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh we know something that you don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done from the local chamber of commerce in one of the counties and that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county right by me\nYeah somebody that was going to be spent on the nose was going to be may be spent that's house secreted was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes\nSo it for us it's a constant fight and you know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to [laughter] ... re portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics ... and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do like to see whether they're actually possible or not or what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the Saturday all brothers oh man\nSo we go on ... we had been getting a information coming in about what was going on and we're in Watertown uh uh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven thirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports 'cause there there was breaking news\nAnd we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this the Boston bombing the other by bombing suspects\nAnd when they essentially went through water town and and uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the the ...\nAbout I don't know halfway through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about\nWell it's it then they gave us Pacific names these are the people that they're chasing these are the people\nThat there why are you saying this asking nuts and they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names quite\nAnd look we're not going to be I don't have\nAny a desire to go out and be first\nI only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I Do I Do not want to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\n\nI don't because here's what's different about specific names if we get the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we we covered we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town\nWhere that is a specific name if\nThose names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross or anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because of Brian Ross so they'd be see after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and they got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting them out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were\nChased him and that always the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify from any legit source and we believe that we have confidence in that it is a ... that is true and and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right and so again we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on\nFor the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth that so you can you can passionately attack the other side but don't play their game I've set up before they need to do it they don't have the substance\nInstead it before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it they ... out of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether whether\nThe side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric\nBecause I feel I have lost the substance of my argument two thousand two thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the power goes to the Democrats and we got calls why aren't you guys angry\nLook it didn't go my way I'm disappointed but I had my thing and that well we had been blunt uh I've\nA friend of mine yesterday posted well you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues or not\nAnd I explained it to him the debt mhm the country's not going the way that I Want when it comes to that Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't matter anymore what we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party we think that's immoral or the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file other and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm\nThat's gone yeah that's that that's why doesn't even exist anymore a fiscal responsibility in the Republican Party that drove Trump ism\nI'm looking at our cp right now the current makeup of the house it's a map of the United states read versus blue and it by and large is mostly it's mostly red overwhelmingly radical step for of course the blue states so the entire you know left coast with the few exceptions\nAre and then you know uh you've got the upper Midwest and

of the reference that Andrew McCarthy used that said okay but we're wondering you know we're talking about the apparent bombers or a objectives you know if\nThey really were not bombs is the objective then at that point purely political in order to make some type of political statement right and that's why the whole false flag issue has come up right\nYeah\nUm I I think that's something that we're likely will learn about and in the coming days if you think about the um the forensics behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with\nSo we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities are seem to be right now focusing on forward as a possible place where these packages or at least some of these packages were mailed from\nThen it's only a matter of time before they narrow that investigation down and at least have a description of not a full on identity or the person or persons responsible for mailing does\nI mean it it won't take it won't be long

with mom [noise]\nMm [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah\nWe'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah ...\nThe secretary of making pies yeah\nUh this this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael I have an end to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that\nHonestly\n\nAt that that warrants that investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if\nAnything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a a a a refer\nI I Would have to look at everything that Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of miss sweat Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from Kenny interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guarantee the Justice Department will open a an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that ... sent he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray right\nBecause\nIf the if the committee were to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen about if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for\nProsecutorial means if you found that there was a wrongdoing if you through the investigation your own investigation\nFrom I don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape ... right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo\nIt's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents you have things in the sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate so I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while at the end it goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses\nOn the the ... if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding or the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that\nWhen we had to come out and said look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and then there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is you're under oath ... if you commit perjury mhm\nIn you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury ... if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley has going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward\nAfter it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes that he can make that case\nFor making false statements based based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was that none of the law should be followed and all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it if you can prove they know you know that they lied\nAnd their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line\nShould go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes\nBecause it is it was an attempt I think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the ah the the motive or what they were trying to do\nWas disrupt the process and if you do that through false means a boat and giving false testimony a sworn in\nIt means a boat giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process\nAnd\nIf you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here was to disrupt that process and you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statement\nThat were false I don't know\nWhy you wouldn't move Fort well then what whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does this really isn't at this point isn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweating it\nNo or apathetic no so\nYou know my question on the on the house thing is that stuff in the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye [noise] books
