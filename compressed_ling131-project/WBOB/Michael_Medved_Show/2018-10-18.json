feel like that's really nice for them to be able to sit and do things you have\nComments your last you know ... and I'm like wow you about I'm given given I\nWell I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but you may get tired of being\nAnd okay I mean I'm I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the summer the incidents where people haven't been shot not people\nI I Can't agree with the police I don't blame them because you should uh you know say you should have just you know adhered to what they were saying instead of you to do but still I mean I don't no matter how you look at it no matter how you put it\nOut immigrants to a land that was never our than the first place [noise]\nNever going to the third and I know I'm going to want to know if they want to go in the history won't you wouldn't\nKnow how to respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indians that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their Indians before those Indians and there's nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's you could say it's unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians\nAnd in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying it was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will\nWhat you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was if slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if it's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world which the United states of America we understood that that came out you know they have ... no no no it's my turn now to monitor\nAnd we understood it would just had a black president of the year I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on and uh the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you said that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible and some case sometimes that does happen someone get shot never should have been shot and they're they're they're good and bad policemen they're good bad talk show host\nBut in general that you probably know the two most blacks are ... murders by blacks or by uh from other blacks and in the inter many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going longer so go ahead now you respond [noise]\n[noise] okay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nHow so how president I appreciate everything he's done because our he had done what Air America dirty laundry instead of everybody sweep the right for them on the on the ... like it's dirt now that it out and being forecast that\nWould everybody would knew that when you have Republicans that's against this man\nBecause how he how and how he eggs that whatever the case may be ...\nStupidity goes a long way it goes a long way\nBut I think a lot of people\nLike I saw a lot of my people y'all can get mad at this man I Want to but the one good thing that he did bring about in this country was air the fact that the racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way way where so where is he wears the racist you mean with the lowest black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist I did I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country has been races for many many years but\nEverybody wants to so I didn't know that now I now I didn't know that is because they don't want to embrace what\nRadio station here because you all very on edge expect black the beep to respond on here\nNo one to expect anybody responded by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I saw him we're all Americans that we all live in you know read the same air as John Kennedy said we're all in this together slowly and people on your side and by your side I don't mean color\nI mean values in politics people on your side I have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals\nAnd I want you know I like people who share my value way way way way back I Know it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women Supreme Court justices if they share my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there I think she hung up and she'd been maybe I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happened here we dropped her but uh\nYou know it's just it's it's sad because we're all here there are there are some reasons here yeah there are some people that still think Elvis Presley is alive\nSo you can account for that you know they do there's always going to be not cool heads out there but the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for everybody live their lives they don't care about color did we make a mistake a long time ago we did\nThey don't care about color did we make a mistake\nA long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference in the eye and she said oh President Trump at least the showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump's ... says some things he shouldn't say but you notice they'll charge them with stuff like he's a racist but then they can't name anything to prove these races right\nAh [laughter] it's it's very discouraging when you get calls like that might people I Love that phrase might people what do you mean then on your people you're the one that's caring about color I I don't care about cholera ... let me acknowledge something I noticed someone is black and that lasts for about it I don't know a tenth of a second and then I get to know them who they are\nBecause color tells you absolutely nothing about someone it tells you nothing\nI care about values and it doesn't tell me anything about values tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six

that has lasted look at Europe they've tried to do the same thing with the European nation a union and\nI think they haven't come anywhere near the success but it was the topic for another time\nUm I

filling in on that I Am radio and\nThey're going to your calls and let's go to let's see what the cameras up to in New York City Pam you're on with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states are easy to get a little that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say that I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator and Florida\nAnd the rates that senator in tech that's and I really haven't heard very much about it but um\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that John ah several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year\nAnd the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two state and I had to\nLive in Florida and I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct I handed the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial races is also if he so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more\nAnd the Democrat side but you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're better off as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm content to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation in in in you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well\nIn those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have ten percent tax\nIf the governor's race just won by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and at that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in there and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about then I'll turn but the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated bowl but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority American people did not want to go through pitchmen again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened he ... he won reelection um\nPeople's ... American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him so badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes went to Congress by the wave announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else so that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video roads blocked\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today\nWe're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver the overnight low thirty four high later today a fifty nine\nIt's winter weather preparedness weak in Colorado a reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is look at your national forecast Trump ... radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm ... and if you want to listen to the shows you done this week at a red eye radio show dot com and hit the listen live button and you can hear all of the show even local city doesn't carry on mark I read I read [noise]\nI'm well I'm\nI recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant\nUm she got pregnant um well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married\nAnd then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act\nAnd I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that he didn't come here\nIllegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard\nEverything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience um I met her to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nI guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo\nNo um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a\nGeorge in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do but I think it's also a misnomer\nWe do not have an illegal immigration we have an in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're we're being invaded by the failures of the other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we wouldn't be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America as soon as the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably mess let up standing around with market\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of\nTheir uh God but I'm just calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people's\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and I'm happy to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than\nOnce and I would say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals put people voting more than once in a new disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over for a voter id\nThat the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know or being races were being this you know how could you do that yet by the way my position is different than most people don't want people to vote\nUnless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or you get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about a year so the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote\nAnd you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting or I don't they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id said you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state one of the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know uh [noise] you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them [noise]\nAnd ah but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd then well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was up so often Emily I Know that do but there's another point that bet you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name have the time of Pennsylvania or new no originally you know yeah I'm right right so you go in the\n... who are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that table\nYou're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the Newbery vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to you\nIf I ever won the Newbery vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had any also give them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you ever selected ideas but they're not going to work have a great evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time there was a primary and uh they had a and I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never writing about I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on and he said well [noise] oh oh you know you're a you want to vote Republican and goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do a write in ballots [noise]\nAnd I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I I\nI thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democratic side you can't run if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time I mean don't you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six Ninety seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for an Iranian\n[noise] why do people your goals eight six six Ninety row on ... radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered have joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors deport your safety on the highway\nAnd dance ski we have hundreds of black beard and specialize million mile drivers Leyden because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national\nPower and then we have a long term home for you as a as a family of sixty locally run sleds bagging specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "18"}
