are\nLet's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you\nBut I'll tell you this ... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or they when they found out what my news were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and when whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot

if they did they can figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them\nAre not I've met many do you know what shepherd I being what what kind of America do we have in twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video

expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecast should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nMost of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas where we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extreme southern Texas and portions of\nWest central Texas set to receive at least another ranch today your winter outlook and today is forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John throughout\nTime mark I saw it I Want to take your calls an eight six six Ninety read I let me know what you think oh I must have been pressing thing to see what's going on a\nI Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good or we will go out of a relationship you know\nWatch started to go in your direction first of all I got to\nI sing ship you know\nWhat I've started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you kind of became I've learned not to say much about politics or\nThe ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I got to control myself sometimes something against me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think of social media right\nThen that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are happening they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I uh I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know ... it up KBC CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything [noise] there's a bright spot or let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do its best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that stuff that came off of a a\nPaul Kennedy and I'm a at a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green\nA all of that probably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that and ah but the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed at a you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review do support it and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI uh not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has he got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois you're on with mark\nHey I've got two observations and then a point to make\nA first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always the liberals and Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships\nThat's well that's the observation\nAnd then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not highly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends [laughter] and then also\nWhen this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise in the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny\nHow the left can sit there in town for individual liberties\nBut they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but the fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there\nThan you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... fascist themselves and they it when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think or they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so\nThat you I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be a little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left where the ...
