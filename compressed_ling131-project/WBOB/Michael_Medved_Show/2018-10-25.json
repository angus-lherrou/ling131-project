cheer premise of believe that President Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean it can be over to X number one you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of\nGovernment I'm a God or your first by presidents come and go\nAh ah okay I'll I'll tell you what the workers were short on time John I'll tell you what would be reversed go ahead or to construction is on the Supreme Court\nGood point yeah excellent point\nYeah I don't I ... I might have I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we stayed at\nWell I Believe that data about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the ... you got all the answers\nFilmmakers from John John John John slowdown we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah saying I made about law and the ... or anything else I Would say anybody but of course I could I could get you on that because I pointed out uh with Kavanaugh and Gorsuch you have to construct yeah you're right on the knowledge\nThat right and and when we want we ... we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch ... look at Obama most about Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders from uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah\nIt's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term well and and here's the thing to\nWhat did you have with the tax cuts\nIn in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it took twenty five per said\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent what I I Know I I it was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administration tried that they tried everything they could to step in the way a private sector\nYou didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads bridges and the business but the state we just we didn't make that statement today that while president what President Trump did a has done we'll be long lasting parts of it will\nSome everything he does one guy because presidents are limited in their power and we've often stated that button and I think you have the perfect answer a the the the fact of two Supreme Court justices construction as is huge and that is long ... ... talk you know it'll be longer generation and there possibly be a third as ... or third and fourth if he's\nEver reelected right right so you know it it that's what it comes down to and and just be careful about putting words in our mouth we didn't say anything to work to zing us let's say [noise]\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the sentence\nWashington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the there was harm you know a along with the\nSuspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realize oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off and\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent prayed political statement would be the next question that you would ask\nThe right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum device of this by blaming somebody throwing incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons who nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against divisiveness and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like\n[laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing yeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you\nKnow right people are ... percent or group of people based on which area which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm yeah if\nYou look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time\nAnd place but but the point being is that they have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle there's a there's a pretty good\nChance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know they may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from what I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bonds or not and they know right they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\n\nWell because in in in and I know is is there a reason that you I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well and if they\nWere armed or or or if they were at\nThat at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building the CNN building a ... those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about the threat the level of threat\nBased on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nKnow because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level of security ah but if it's if you\nAnd they're always going to have that a great level of security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at that looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the gels or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and they're recording our radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or Android ... at red eye radio show dot com and use the key word mobile\nTo keep you trucking cc are tired or some sort of dedicated to providing high speed tiresome cutting edge to thousands of devoted to service\nOver Fifteen hundred service draw the line ... you can keep going on and on but\nThirty seconds so let's just say we're not at all or a hundred and sixty stores\nCobra electronics is proud to support the fight against breast cancer by bordering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them ... to ...

eye [noise]\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support\n\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\n[noise] he said again I have argued outs where the party should have been braced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was in two thousand five ... or just ... they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat what their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssued them the challenge and that's what I thought it was shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't didn't they\nSome of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public any even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are black and Hispanic ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote\nDemocrat mhm no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically\nBut the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want that all you know the president wants you know what the Republicans\nWon and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes by\nThe way he's also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here\nRight do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other\nThings that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only\nOne side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that now That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are\nAbout to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country\nLook you have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who and I mean\nBut at any level tell me who and I mean the from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe ... ... ... you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official ... political battle\nHow can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want\nRight\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice\nThey won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans with Republicans about Thirteen Years to pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will ... is the question eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWe were born
