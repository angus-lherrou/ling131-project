I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific the allegation will get into the the the details ever but here it is this the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nTo talk about allegations of Donald Trump and the Russia collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign so that would have been late\nSeptember early October at the latest uh twenty six thing if vowels\nFormer up yeah general counsel James Baker met during the two thousand six team at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee\nPrivate law which is the organization of paid fusion GPS to hire the former British spy to get\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\nAnd it it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday while there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that have ah have information or potentially they could be witnesses that is one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nKavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats\nWill do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff for eggs and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about\nUh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell a out of a of a lot of D. C. uh yesterday about the James Baker [laughter] uh uh apparently telling the house or the house ah ah I don't know which panel was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked\nTo the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official or at that time which without question shows the politics played a part and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true it ...\nIt has all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that uh Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff has do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this ruling affect that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do of every ...\nOf every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours\nThe rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in a ...

a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign will get to that coming up following the the bottom of the hour Haiti NPR poll out there\nYeah and that's interesting the net National Public radio poll that shows that uh the Democratic enthusiasm edge for the election has a ... and it was a ten points just a but in July ... and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology a and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but five thirty eight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition\nType poll based on all the polls ah in all the districts are for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put together\nOr something those numbers or we don't make predictions but certainly you look at the polls and we want to look at those ...\nI think especially after from Thursday last Thursday on ah the capital here a couple of things I Want to briefly touched on coming up on the bottom of the hour Saudi Arabia has increase or crude production why this is from Bloomberg Trump\nMm yeah St you better do it you want military stuff you better do

Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nOr you get that [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason they held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in\nElder everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by a claiming that he gets kind of a partisan and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward there are going to claim he's part is in and\nTry and demand that he recused himself for abstain from any votes\nMay be worth anything they want to but they if they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\nOkay yeah they can't scream that\nWell ... ... email us ... screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't\nGet anywhere with it okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and\nShow that judges should recused himself Oh yes for an hour well you know when they lose\nThe electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process and we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah um I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't like\nLay were an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if\nIf or or there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and rights but they don't get any fear at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't rule on anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any\nWater that you remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter]\nShe would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but\nThe ... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that's seated on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure\nOn procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often how these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context\nAh they did that with Scalia um but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect for each of those that are ...\nAnd ... and but I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends ... needs to make that their ... their their family their families used to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you\nWhat you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job there is even even if we can sit here and and we have been said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because entertains adore\nThis is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never her doctor Ford's name but the ... came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone would first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim\nThat cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just a federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye and the only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is well journalists core and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would've never would have you know that's the ... when you\nThe report and you wouldn't hear about\nIt but it would have never it would've you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... you were not would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now that makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about\nIt now you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged
