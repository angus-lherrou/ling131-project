I mean you talk about the the the destruction\nThat they stormed does and and some of the things I guess if you've never been in the situation\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied up that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in a statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched and again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it\nIt all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans fight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races\nThat are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabin on hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's are we are right now looking at some of the the the Senate races are are you\nYou look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane Michael [noise] uh and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks\nUm it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator and a isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nUm ... like a governor would during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very\nPolitically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his camp will tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be but people outside that a camp car focused on that and will\nBe one of the reality is that if\nFlorence was in handled properly by\nThe Trump Administration Democrats would be using them yes and and it ends up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I've talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more of the of of Florence a coming and then I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with a great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling the s it'll be interesting to see at the same thing

preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption of of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if\nI Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious those

mentioned because everybody else's because she sees this as the future of the part ... and she and she also believe that the mainstream of yes already it's ... for the bowling saying it's okay to call to for\nInstability because somebody believes in due process a presumption of innocence a preponderance of the evidence to decide somebody whether you believe somebody is guilty or\nNot you went from weeks ago people talking about John McCain and we need more stability to the official call for instability in just a matter of weeks\nYou believe in due process under the constitution you believe in uh the presumption of innocence you don't believe somebody just because they say at the evidence has to prove it in their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are imbedded in the constitution of the United states\nThan you are a rape enable us to get a rapist enable is that what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their opinion

hearing McIntyre along with the air early eight six six Ninety a red eye coming up on the bottom of the hour\nMeteorologist Tom hale will join us on the latest on hurricane Michael which has been upgraded to over night and in fact in the last National Hurricane center advisory about an hour and a half ago to hurricane for\nYeah we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly again or not much is changing in terms of the fact that this is a\nA life threatening storm or a major hurricane on its way\nTo Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here and just a few minutes and follow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and as well or the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic\nDid you see where a ... center of Tom Cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before word letter really yeah he was on with a huge huge show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean ... because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities because if you were Feinstein you you don't take it the chairman Grassley you ticket to sugar party let her right and and have him deal with it ripe for video robot here's your forecast\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins have increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane\nMichael extremely dangerous life threatening storm surge\nHurricane force winds and heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline\nAnd as much as twelve inches of rainfall from the system for areas just inland from where we expect Michael to make landfall and the big band and panhandle area\nOf Florida will see rain from the system into the Carolinas over the next several days also be aware of winter weather advisories from the northern plains into Colorado on the eastern side of the Rockies you're national for cash from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout thanks\nSo much John if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore yeah it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nComes to shore right now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course ah you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in in the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nAh being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly\nAnd and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out in the lightning and I write [laughter]\nOkay yeah indoors it's lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because\nThey decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now\nAnd and and and so yeah a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there is a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the big band that you're looking at a storm surge that it's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mentioned\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the ... in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what\nI described that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fat how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um all the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is his Israeli and extension the northern extension of the north bay\nOr the grand lagoon this entire area\nFrom the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach I'm an inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kinda like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a snowing like sonata it's turning the water on hand watching you're about to fill\nAnd except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub spill and so\nIn the Carolinas the the I don't know if it was the record but at the start close to it ... North Carolina\nUh picked up a storm surge of it was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point\nUm that that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um but this water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth\nYou need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge that says really simple as it gets [noise] and this water is moving and and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise]\nUm when I say it's moving it it's it's normal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed and so you've got a certain amount of ah\nIt's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension of the water is going to slow that body down but it's still moving so I ... the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times [noise]\nUm because it's just a beautiful ride in your entity out here you know if you've done this a dream for each point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge [noise] and you're looking at Appalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um\n... then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still\nYou're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that\nIs very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that it's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structured and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on and so again the timeline here we're looking for the eyes to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that it's going right now and makes it nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north north east [noise]\nUh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise]\nUm but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth [noise]\nAh we could anticipate the same coming out a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody is betting on right now and I thought there and getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off this little find drops in then increases from there [noise]\nUm there's a couple of thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nHow far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and a bus\nIt was hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far in London and how long do you expect that to be the case\nBy let's assume that it it comes ashore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for alright forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her and forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those winds back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to Panama City\nOr a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola\nHurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from All right so\nSo they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachian coal uh and\nAnd possibly you know and then an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up they'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds her even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\nReroute this Tom hale a Tom we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour on the following me our as well to get caught up thank you Tom for your time and we'll talk to you in just a bit and will stay on top of hurricane Michael right here on bread I radio\nWhat are we more liberal radio with a record ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "10"}
