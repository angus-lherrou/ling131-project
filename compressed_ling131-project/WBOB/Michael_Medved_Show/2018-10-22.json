going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats have been ... over the weekend ... last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a ... plan yeah of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's get will on the Braves pitching gum you first get rid of the the tax cuts\nRight they act taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was I I'm\nA but the ... six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing there's no deductible there is nothing mhm\nWhich ah by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said\nGood screw people than that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter a screen old people because they're not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay for Medicaid for them right\nUh but uh you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm\nAnd we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go that route it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah yep\nIt's because there has to be again that that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of usher in this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay maybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I ... I Know a lot of people have Trump but I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but I\nAm I'm motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they gonna do for me you're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the than the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was\nJust you know random participants on the street interviews and the the one common thread in those and those respond as from those respondents was when he was talking about problems we have here at home\nShe kept talking about problems over seas somewhere outside of this country all as we said\nThe reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was\nWhat the problems ...\nAnd the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates that have looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems and we have to solve them and that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about instill our climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not riding Americans didn't deal with that way right from is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions that he has come up with\nOr that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America today\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solutions mhm\nYeah I mean that's in and that's it it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term just results\nSo if we're still looking at low unemployment and we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because taxes are lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\nThan where\nDo you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work\nAlternately you're gonna have to you know I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan but guess what people still say the the name of the plan now we torn apart and it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him but the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work\nHere's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're going to do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nBanned because here's what changed after the great recession and we saw this it was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there is\nThat affect their but the concern is too is that amongst\nThe you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter\nThey're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package and they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me\nThey they compare themselves to their neighbor or somebody else and it's like now I just got to end this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of

I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in taxes remembered twenty sixteen in the primary he won the state he won Texas\nOr he also won Iowa a but but\nThere may be may be could have been something where a Ted Cruz would have lost to a ... a back there and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted Cruz has a fairly comfortable lead and it's over fifty\nIn the most recent polls\nAnd were what two weeks in a day out\nSo something would have to happen between now and then to change those falls about saying it couldn't but it would have to be a pretty decent shift to make up for that lost ground which would mean typically get outside the margin of error that's going to have to be a a seven to ten points swing\nIn favor of Beto O'Rourke and there's nothing working in that direction\nBut but I but you just ask yourself the question here based on what the rock star based on what\nUh I you know I I I don't know and I and I look at I look at a ... if you just if I Do cook analysis of the\nThe new the a\nIs no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go ... what they don't understand that those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority this\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that about ... got responds all it's a bubble thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges and how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm\nAnd so the average person I think she is at and Trump is anything they look at ... and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist even at times though his words we like it don't say that\nYeah I ... when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's\nAll constitutional yes it's all part of the process that was put in\nPlace hundreds of years ago\nI mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it\nThat we're not going to win the electoral college vote then you're ready to get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it does or on me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the presidency that's anti American\nYes\nNo it's not well what America are you for ... it's not America where they don't like it was on the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America\nWhat do you believe in besides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides exactly an eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nWas ready to do with a record ...

radio he is currently and I'm hearing back tomorrow we'll get to more of your calls and comments coming up following the bottom of the hour up but I I thought it's important\nTo bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election but I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards\nThat he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that here in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there is an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nAnd that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to have elected behaving in and that type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the capital confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and will seat and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low pressure system and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra as an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west no change him the chances for snow\nIn the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter there's the Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the

yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNothing nothing we've ever seen a ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with so tomorrow and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we\nUp and said that didn't happen with so tomorrow and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right the cell tower cases the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used um\nPrior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is exactly that was the press and the right they use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but\nWhat the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we should look ... you know conservatives and Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice and what not and\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand that their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on on a capital you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you could look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS was recess appointments which was ... yeah against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear\nOn what the process yes and so respecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process\nAt the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion\nYou can we can tear it apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that but in terms of the process I think ah by and large\nI have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others\nA recess appointments was that unanimous decision where ... you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the President's Day do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the constitution ... what's left\nTo the point there is no process and we'll shout you down just to get our way which means we'll get control of your life\nYou better button it up north
