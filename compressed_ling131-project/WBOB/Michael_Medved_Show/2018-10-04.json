that the getting the Pfizer war it was all about politics will get the bad here and just a little bit but we found out the process here by how\nThe Senate Judiciary committee will uh be able to get a look\nAt the actual background check right that the FBI has done and the actual report\nAired you've been doing some research or during the break on that yeah so there was back in two thousand nine by the way the Democrats control the Senate and the house then a a memorandum of understanding of centrally which has a rule in the Senate that was that was created\nTo keep the background check for a nominees secret okay um you and under that rule\nThe procedure is just that there is one copy paper copy not electronic there's not thrilled to report or from the FBI on Capitol is not going to be sent via email you can't take pictures of it\nUm and you can make note if you're a senator looking at it with your notes will be secured in the same way that the forms will be and those forms are highly secure so this is how it's going down\nThis is the procedure there's one copy of it\nIt's going that one copy who's going to go into a room\nWith the senators the GOP will have an hour with the the Democrats have an hour with it we were told it was being widely reported that they were looking over that a late Wednesday evening I'm the report from the hill a\nEarlier in the day Thursday Afternoon into Thursday evening was that they would review it on Thursday\nOr but the reports came out that they you know it was the senators had it and I assume we're reviewing it and taking that time to review it or at least the GOP might have been a as late as a Wednesday evening so that could pour over into Thursday\nNow there's been some some concern there and of course protests by Dick

get\nBourbon is he's you know freaking out that it's they only get one hour they only get one hour they only get one hour if you look at the number of senators or that you know and they only get thirty minutes each then that's going to be a problem that will take of course fifty hours into well\nThis is again typical that you would want to ... you're trying to keep it secured\nYou're trying to keep it secured so you basically go in you know the left goes and the Democrats going as a team the Republicans go in as a team\nAnd those those who were claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers well wait a minute he\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments at the rally\nOr were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left to once again has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting there or not if

I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here it is this the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nTo talk about allegations of Donald Trump and the Russia collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign so that\nWould have been late September or early October at the latest uh ... while\nFormer up yeah general counsel James Baker met during the two thousand sixteen with one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee\nPrivate law which is the organization that paid using GPS to hire the former British spy to get the\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday well there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that that have ah have information that potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold the elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or Kavanaugh\nThere's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats\nWill do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all on Adam Schiff ... and not on this but Adam ... who will be talking about uh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in a bombshell\nOr out of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker uh apparently telling the house or the house ah ah I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in touch closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked\nTo the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker atop FBI official or at that time which without question shows the politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on and he talked to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we ask the question on\nHas come true it is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it it it ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that uh a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's not there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that ah Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour my point that Adam ship is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so that they won't release it and they know the Republicans Romer Lisa because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this ruling affect that hey we can't be ... every background check we do have every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show\nGo home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ...

...\nWe're going to Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] [noise] good [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by claiming that he gets kind of partition and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually got to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork too\nStop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward [noise] they're gonna claim he's part a sin and try and demand that he recused himself for abstain from any votes\nMay have you with anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they they claim it earlier cell scream at all day long but they'll get nowhere get anywhere with it\nOkay I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo show that judges should recused himself oh yeah great at our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are stupid and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules\nRight ah and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah\nI Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were or even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't wait\nWe're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if if or\nOr are there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law or you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the ... at that point to have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water\nYeah you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter]\nShe would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and the and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that uh well she's part of his family but\nThe ... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by\nEveryone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but\nWe can talk about that but the procedure on procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect\nFor those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not\nIt is not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with I'm often out of context\nAh they did that with Scalia or but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great ... great money to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if\nWe can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because ...\nDoor this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate and two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three of his secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some\nContent that came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone would first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but\nHere's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is well journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI the vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to then cooperate and then at that point it ...\nWe're not would not have been able to been cooperating and then at that point it dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because of that work in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep\nEight six six
