closed down the business that can make as much money as they possibly can and government mostly stays out of it very\n... you know you have a black the anti trust ... make sure uh companies don't get

tried to explain to folks is\nWe might not have been a overly a supportive of our ... we we we even this'll I talk to them all\nBut one thing we never did and I ever get never saw any one burn a flag how'd I probably would have spoke up but the one thing we did not do was hate America to me we we didn't like the government but we didn't have a hung jury\nYep and then that's a significant it's certainly changed that way or that so many people here on the left\nDo not like a murder or what America stands for and that's why I said you're\nBumper sticker wouldn't for the left and uh they got a real problem with the flag right that people are are we in that the protest in Portland people with a flag were trying to ... the prayer or if that's what I was the phrase I was looking for evidence they try to save the American flag because of the ... was burning it\nSo there are people out there and now we call on the left who do not believe in the values that America stands for and that's the

I was going to mention we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a loss and he's he's a lawyer and he brought up a sweat and the girl I Can't even as that's her name\nAnd she thought a lot and she to some of the you know they were part of this gang rape or at least than they were there and it was so postures they actually hurt the case\nAnd the other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because it you start to get ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those it in here and the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no ... evidence against the judge\nAnd that's that's the way it goes sometimes you you know when you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand how you guys like President Trump and they're trying to narrow it down and find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now or the mother is not going to come up with anything on collusion the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely and then she you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had her on the you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty is something to inclusion but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nOr whether it's Michael Flynn horror Manafort they lose all their stuff and ... cases and really agree just because\nOf the FBI interviews him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get them on line to the FBI which is a great point I Would never\nGo through an interview with the FBI anymore because again you don't have to uh in in most cases I guess and loves loves to have court documents or um because you then say something and then someone contradicts you later and they can get your on line to the FBI\nEven if he was uh your your memory was lacking or the other person was wrong\nThey want to say you were lying to the FBI good luck to you and I have a case now in court against you for mine for the FBI so a lot of people around President Trump\nOr at least the numbers that they mentioned thirty four they Leslie stall I think in the interview I don't know how many she said the president a lot of them were Russians that had nothing to do with him they were they were indicted on something in terms of uh I guess election hacking or election fraud I don't remember myself but it had nothing to with the president\nI took a chase the socialists Democrat and how they want they want to have them and they don't believe in global isn't but where do they think that we're going to get the money to pay for
