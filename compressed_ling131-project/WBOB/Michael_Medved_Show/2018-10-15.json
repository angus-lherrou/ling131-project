anything great about western civilization\nAnd they don't take our constitution as a document that we can change depending on the way more you know their views at the moment and they don't believe in

want to um usually an optimist but I just want to be real it doesn't I don't know how many seats it takes twenty something [noise]\nBut the fact is that um and we're in trouble and it doesn't look good because the mayor of the house is done on an individual basis or area by area state by state so it sure seems to me that uh we're in trouble and we could easily or lose\nA house represents I don't think we're going to lose the Senate but we are going to lose the house of representatives if enough people don't go out and vote is very very scary what's\nHappening let's go to a how

staunch conservative but\nHim and go out and child was good buddies who wanted to go there you know and ... the ... you know you might be a different party and I have a few different ideas\nBut you got along and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a ... it's not about\nPolitics and the way things are going now a Hillary brought up the poor balls\nThe Democratic party has turned into the party of the ... the way they did judge Kavanaugh\nIs\nTotally deplorable but why did I Do anybody that draws stand up for what they think he's right if ms agree with the Democrats\nIf they did the Democrats [noise] they're not going to let me know what you're saying mark\nA vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or the principles of courses another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job of a business to give you a livable wage you know it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics drive a business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be don't you don't have any work or they won't hire you or do lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nOf the job of a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat's what the Soviet Union did not to communism is that's what's socialism is\nAnd as most young people but they've never heard the other side where does money come from I've said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes it ... from some group of people in the form of tax and given gives it the others when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before [noise] see conservatives can we and it's a harder thing to explain\nA pen just big emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming and of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just say these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise it arbitrarily and the government should do with some bureaucrats shouldn't do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\n... this is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against her oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things that against him a and\nLet's go to David in Greenwich ah let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey and sounds like fire\nDavid [noise]\nGood morning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess my her six points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not or what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I like them was charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again\nPresident Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen\nI mean he's a businessman he's a wheel under your show he's hated for what he said\nNot what he done second I think the\nPeople in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations just like if you and I wanted to start our own right eye radio corporation political party we couldn't do it too so when they take us so personally thinking this is us and this is it's not an us and them to corporations and\nThe you know that's that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country you should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five\nSo you know how to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nUh as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once and I mentioned the civil war and he says it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing simple about it well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave\nCome a long time in Congress and not because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves a and you know I'm I'm just not question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said\nI I mean the bottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr ... or ... or or or Mr selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing\nI mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with a capital\nBut uh this country's out of control and it doesn't straighten out there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there and should understand that\nYou know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back ... years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start ... apart internally\nSomeone's going to make a move on us trend I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test to see because just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's return to the doctor but I Know people doctors at just because they have a degree doesn't make them\nVery wise so I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a car about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble\nBut I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Know I certainly want don't want to make it easier to get a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election\nThings that you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where where people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks I Want to be a reasonable effort I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they saw it online and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them the vote and then they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color it was like hell or whatever they were using to signify that they voted\nWe we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like I'm contradict myself to make it easier to the people on our foreign to vote the\nSame token you cannot voting and of course a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south\nTerms of trying to keep a black from voting and others so that that's not my idea or not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMZ and vote well going to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nThat's a chore too so hey I've got a story later weekly here at\nThe Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get postage stamps that is that a true story they don't get postage theft\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to be on the caller was talking about\nThe ... and I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to the other caller was talking about let's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on with mark [noise]\nHey mark [noise] I don't agree that the American civil war vast majority of Americans today several people were very bright line in the region in the\nAmerican public are disappointed I mean a legislator what got elected because he was an outsider empty because either business plan and then the money that his business\nHe's very cruel and he knows when he's in a bad deal and he [noise] I think a great job for all the I I I really admire him that he puts the topic the first\nRecognizing the international court systems up when you get the influences the in our world\nA like a looming out either do to reverse they will they're so\nPowerful and wealthy and as a group they can walk to control the world they don't want to talk of the country they don't want them there they don't want a constitution they slowly\nCould lead to a lot they cringed upon you know such a leader in the crowd girls\nAre invaded in ... you know what else [noise]\nI don't know you may I thanks I yeah I was going to say you you made your point there uh I don't have to agree with the bill of berries necessarily but the other right we have the Europeans who have a you know a whole system now that\nLooks like it may be falling apart because people don't want far away governments to determine what goes on their lives but I don't agree with you I mean I don't have to write that the civil war you can call it what you want\nBut the anger and the differences between the left and the writing is very strong and as I said if if the Democrats take back the house is a next few weeks\nYou know for like what you're saying you're just not going to like what you're saying it's gonna be worse than what you saw the Kavanaugh hearings let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which is the same as eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus are filling in on red eye radio\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them do you choose to see X.

power and oh yeah\nProbably now you can't even have a drink at night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying is commonplace as with an image that's with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nAll of it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this gay if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nSo the assault you may have heard about this maybe you didn't hear about it that Keith Ellison may very well have made or else in sorry may very well made against this girlfriend is not important news running I guess Minnesota for something I think it's going to turn in general are lieutenant governor whatever it is he's\nOn the left and maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which isn't exempt group I'm up against Muslims but you can't attack them these new rules are only for those on the right the ends justify any means\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this is the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the coot across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against his nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they pose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nViscerally ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI check said nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct you\nMean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the inadequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment to the hardest core to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on the nominee the burden is on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then voila you've never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU watching someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there is no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America [noise] tell me what you think of all of this application of the Simpson of innocence and

west west of the Rockies the northern plains will be clear\nThe deep south drying out\nAnd the north east under pleasant conditions and that includes the mid Atlantic region as we begin the work week there's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\n[noise] that's eight six six\nNinety read I call me that\nThat number is eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine mark filling in on the radio\nWent around his together yet and you know rent yeah what I was I was there what's on your mind Sally\nThe thing that that there are several things but one of them is that it's Feinstein really wanted to get to the ...\nWere not let it came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks on gun all that she wanted political theater and she is getting me too movement to try to get it and it just made up of fires\nMeant to try to do this and it just made up of fires and unbelievable I Am a survivor of uh me too I I had happened to me\nAnd I didn't believe by the board for a minute not for a minute and they use that to make everybody I mean it just made a sham out of the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just scream\nAnd I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they took our but now was it absolutely does that come out I Can't even it's unbelievable to me that you would do that to an innocent man for political gain complete craziness\nYeah no I understand where you think so I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turn to a question him or not the question they just put on the show\n... pretty disgusting and of course is grim pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left U.S Supreme court judges and they won in big numbers\nSo we we often are the part where the stupid party and then in my opinion then the evil part it hurt someone else save us and um we've got to learn that we're in a civil war\nAnd I want them to get someone who's so the greed with me were the go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\n... through I think that ah I've heard all are way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political she said she said no the other nonsense [noise] one thing that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nWith the ball over the line so to speak for whoever can that you want to support is to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day and Greek voters\nOr what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago [noise]\nUh is uh if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces no it won't be any good if you got a crew margin but it's all grumpy and no one wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nBut I always set up a little card table with a bowl of candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller for starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make a difference\nYou know you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch I run for office cross in California last\nRepublicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\nA ... Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then we went over to consultants and TV and I think we went to strengthen some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April you're on with mark on the road I radio\nHi [noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war\nAnd I believe that there's a difference the civil war I think we are going to prove something similar to that but on the civil war both sides are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and uh and there are young people they and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized\nConservatism organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people as they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view they screen that\nHow can any person as a young person in ... in college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people this at the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing to be liberal\nSo all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be aware of the good side they think\nThey're on the good site and it being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails windows like some of the antifa is you know group dies\nBut we're not serving our records were being too quiet and I don't think every groan American\nThat's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide\nOf these termites of little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend I'm going here looking at protests are going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in\nLike ... a protest it but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we're being like um\nBullied to just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer\nAnd what's his name Cuomo but he just said lately that President Trump's he's trying to get all the uh any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they\nSaid Republicans are now yeah\nDid you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it he's he's a President Trump this is the way they the Republicans handle things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose to go after the ... set them up\nI didn't even know but the kids and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watch it and he's twenty or Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got 'em to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard what Hitler was\nSaying and telling them you are strong we are good\nWe will be ... feet and the kids aren't sharing with smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad 'cause if I knew there was something going on\nAnd I wouldn't be the only one there and the police to be there to protect\nAnd make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know it and we're letting it happen\nDidn't see that it's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and play pay less sweat and all these other singer let die I mean they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently and in college if they don't think what the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think you did it I don't think it's fair because that civil war the two sides fighting equally\nYeah we wish your considerably more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say you know I'm teasing obviously you're very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is it's not a wonder that students come out and the liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if you doctrine ate them you get them early then that's the way they're gonna think can be except for this [noise]\nWhoever the president there seems to make a difference when Reagan was president he got more Republicans\nAre the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success forget the media I Know that's a problem to get those schools [laughter] I Know that's a problem\nThey tend to see what's going on and they ... more Republicans are you know take place in the time like that now you're right we got a lot of stuff against us and the republic you are right the Republicans don't know how to fight\nI Can't argue with you and much of this but despite everything and the attempt to destroy President Trump he won last time and I believe he's a pro he's going to win again in my first our set a better word spread that 'cause I don't want them to have a heart attack on the other side\nBecause the American people like I said this in front of a Ronald Reagan's daughter marine one time there was a meeting and I was a speaker and I said President Reagan would have won again and again and again\nBecause of the American people understood who he was and the decency and the the faith in America that he had and with President Trump you know you're going to get tired of winning despite what he does his Twitter feeds that you wish you didn't say sometimes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "15"}
