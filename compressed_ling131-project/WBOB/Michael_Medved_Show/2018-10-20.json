the cameras up to in New York City Pam you're on with mark\nYes Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and tack to those two states are easy to get a little fat that Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say that I Am very concerned about the rates on governor and senator in Florida\nAnd the rates that senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but\nI get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know that Texas but\nI don't know if you had any insight to what's going on there I Know that John ah several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or a ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had to live in Florida\nAnd I really can't with them because they're they just did not want to talk about politics\nAnd that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side if he's still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand and the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also a if he so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side but you know\nIllegal votes they can get from people outside of the country and the Democrat side but you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're good friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about the house to I don't know what the ...\nCongressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I often don't understand why\nThe ... when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk well why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax\nIf and governor's races one by the Democrats in Florida and he wants to do a lot of radical things and at that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand their for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand that as I've been saying tonight it it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats it's much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored they oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about not talking about the same job necessarily\nA and then it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeat ... but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now 'cause they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it and with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's marrying people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing and saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside\nThey treated in some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way even ounce that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else so that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast for video roads blocked\nAn area of low pressure and we'll be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit to you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be re and free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news areas showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas or going to get about another inch of rain today\nAnd then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the week ahead for the region that we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest for the four corners region southern states are predicted to have a wetter than average winter\nThere is a lecture national forecast from right on the radio a meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm ... if you want to listen to the shows you done this week at a red eye radio show dot com and hit the listen live button and you can hear all of the show even if your local city doesn't carry over\nRecently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant\nUm well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\n... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here\nIllegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh\nIt it it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer fees everything\nI guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence I'm ... I'm\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a\nGeorgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and everyone kind of latch don't suit but I think it's also a misnomer\nWe do not have an illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're more being invaded by the failures of these other patch\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America Says that the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to is so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that ups than Iran with mark\nAnd mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd\nAnd I was sick and um you know how to stop that and if you remember like during the ah with when we were sitting up governments either in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as\nThey were taking you know people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple you know they couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once in a new disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over voter id\nThat the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know that oh we're being races were made in this you know how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote\nUnless they care enough to put forth some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much here where we get to vote in the same day voting rights and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about a year so the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote\nAnd you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id since you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person\nAnd say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up in another ward or district or state on the same day\nAnd you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age\nBut at the same time he could be starting a voter id form you know the ... you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them\nAnd uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them to see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nAnd well there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... thank you so often evidently I Know that do but there's another point that but you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name have five Pennsylvania or no no I'm originally you know I'm right right so you're going to people\nWho are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that\nYou're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out and if I ever won the Newbery vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to also give them cameras detect\nAnd provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to also give them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you ever selected ideas but they're not going to work have agreed evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have that went into vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a they asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you can you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like you know I'm\nTotally amazed they said well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're you want to vote Republican and goes uh or or a Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot\nAnd I says well you said I could they says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I I I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats you can't run if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud
