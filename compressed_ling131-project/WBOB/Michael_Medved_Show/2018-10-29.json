I've said all the way back to the uh\nBeginning formation of this country or a big central big federal central government versus a smaller a central government has been the debate that's gone on for two hundred and forty years now and uh when you look now into modern times\nUh liberalism over the last forty fifty years sixty years in this country Seventy years and go back to Social Security has been about a bigger government role in providing for all\nTo the point now where we are at a uh a guaranteed income\nA free health care\nFree college and now baby bonds already talked about last week yeah taking care of you from cradle to grave not help not just helping those who truly need it\nBut making it so all because the the uh\nCriminal here six thousand dollars of the guaranteed income I think we'd go to anybody under a hundred thousand I Believe it is yeah I think it was ... okay\nUh and and so it's not even about helping those in dire poverty it's about the transfer\nOf wealth mhm we've often talked about the um [noise]\nThat tax mhm and what a huge transfer of wealth that has done and and how in the past that has\nA help to destroy many family businesses because they had to

the rich a hundred percent of their income ... even if you're taxed a hundred ...\nIt's a hundred percent of their income ...\nEven if you're taxed a hundred percent of it you're still not going to still not going to be able to get what you want a up for it so it's not sustainable\nBut that's one thing having that debate for Thirty years we have had that debate for Thirty years roughly we've had

away and just looking at the some of the polling are out there by the way the best call I got was this past weekend we're independent Bob called me and said I'll come Valdez or the Democrat candidate running against governor Abbott here in Texas I haven't seen any commercials\nThat are explained to him that you don't run many commercials you're not going to going to get major backing from any major political party when you're down by twenty points so it's it becomes really hard to raise money when no one's backing you\nI did read that Republicans think they may have a shot and New Jersey and into\nA with the with the uh Bob Hugin against our Rob yeah and as I thought that a last when shows uh this is ten sixteen minutes is up by five margin of error for ... or ... excuse me Bob Menendez a by five margin of error five point one Menendez all over the fifty percent mark which\nIs usually had a great indicator that you're going to win but uh they claim they believe that they have a chance\nSo I don't know yeah I I don't know why they think that I'd like to see why and and and unless you could say you've seen the polls closing\nBecause ... was up by nine the middle of a you know just a two weeks ago and and a couple of days later okay he was only up by five okay there was just a day difference so I'm really not a lot you're talking about a couple of days difference there was momentum there\nHasn't been a poll since the sixteenth so I don't know if they see something that ... in there and turtles right we haven't seen yet yeah I'd love\nTo know what they're seeing them um that that would be very interesting that would be very interesting uh some very close races though right now in the Senate\nI I think you know you you look at those and and you would get down to election day is going to be really tied on about three at least three or four of those races for video wrote dog here's your forecast\nIf you missed a chance this weekend to be at a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country\nThe upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota most of Pennsylvania and New York and the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nAnd portions of central Iowa and we'll have some rain to contend with in the Midwest region I mentioned throughout Indiana Ohio portions of the lower Tennessee Valley today we'll see showers move through moving off to the east we'll see those rains for the mid Atlantic\nAnd the New England states says we get into tomorrow the southern part of the nation will be dry today you won't need the windshield wipers on I ten from California all the way to Florida\nTexas gets another day to dry out there is a look at your national forecast Retta radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOh I'm trying to say is that it seems to me a as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me the trunk and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need\nThe rise is people who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in their same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me\nThat you're in an okay but what is not in the last ... after that we're in gestures guilty okay well let me we're ... we're using language is characterized by right well here's not here to energy it's here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion ... okay are you people are dying as a result of\nHatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay here's the saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the that the yanks when we're we've got some\nInterference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I\nBelieve Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top\n... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give\nHim keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIsn't only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care about how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America\nBy a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today dating reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president mhm\nYup what's gonna happen I'm a look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said\nAnd and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact be clarified that right after it happened yes\nBut again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it at all or rapists and no\nYou said all he said rapists\nWell and he didn't say they were all rape is won't name across it and and ... changed and making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making\nYes\nBecause does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\n\nVery simple or something I'd like to go point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nBecause you have to understand where liberalism ... or ... you know again and you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points\nA\nBy the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n\nYeah what are you going to both of us are going to promote what what was the third political party stand for well where's the center\nWhere's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a monitor it is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is a think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but it starts\nPretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme far left\nWell tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for what do they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how I uh talked to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and knew he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nThose look my dad loved Trump because Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but not a racist he's done you said come on is in New York City deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus was he said because they're not liberal anymore now she would be in his fifties\nMhm so he might still be some of the old school liberal so that exist out there versus the new school liberals that are really have the mindset of a fascist right\nIf you want to get in lines are open eight six six
