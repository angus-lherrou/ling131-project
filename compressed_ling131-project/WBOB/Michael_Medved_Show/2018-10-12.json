Radio Welcome to the show\nI really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said\nIncluding perhaps at a political agenda with respect to tell them that this is such a thing called about it's about our country being able to pick against everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nKnowledge horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here because then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be\nDoing and retail doors shutting were left and right in the opposite for job he would go in a massive recession\nIf we had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would skyrocket\nThrough the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nFor the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but said we even had those rare metals\nDo produce everything here means number one you're not going to buy anything from anybody else which means they're not going to buy anything from you\nWhich means us producers only have a market of three hundred and twenty million people are three hundred and thirty whatever it is down instead of seven billion people the farmers would be if they ...\nThey will be done by what they feed the world we as a nation to be the world\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason or communist supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all that it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the\nCost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is\nA negative that is strictly controlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place that doesn't need to be there what\nHave you don't win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you could have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle and already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increase the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's used as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent ...\nAh and the\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask\nOkay what were the what were the because at the president's trying to make days the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know it produces them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmers but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food or you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world um you know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the ... because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight 'cause it it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling while in ... of of getting things\nDone as you said it was it like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that show and\nAnd and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise\nConservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nWell wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to go she Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I say if it was said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know it and you can ... as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did allow ... what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth\nThe loss of business with the tariffs that the president has put on that\nAs raise the cost of goods and services\nIt has put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but\nHis big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion was the automobile thing I got what I wanted in automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some uh some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that well fine you just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight or and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal ... most and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other terrorists hit\nWell we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states has only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... where do you worry that Kevin weren't emerging the cap well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada and Mexico are reaching they gave him enough buffer space so it's actually not go into effect that it's more it well it is symbolism over the substance said okay we're going to produce them here and not over there\nSo when you actually look at the specifics of what is in NAFTA what the new NAFTA what did you actually gain specifically you noticed no one is talking about that the only thing they brought up\nWas what they did on automobiles and the one percent increase in the market share of Canada yeah eight six six Ninety right out\nAm

you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish

negotiations again and the whole ... thing and you made a great point because you're talking about Larry\nSabato the the the pollster on a with a a Chuck Todd ... talking about the that the Republicans looking weak in the in in the mid west and we said directly has agriculture has the\nHas the agriculture industry and does that make their money off of it have they you know have they looked at the president said\nLook Republicans in the day they look and they just say we're voting against the party of the president\nIt's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's it\nUh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration on you know giving the money is saying they would rather have the business or that shows that they believe this could be long term pain for video world law here is your forecast\nWe'll see that region today the Florida Panhandle the Big Bend area dry out under clearer conditions good news for the region from Mother Nature we can look at the entire deep south and the mid west today to see clear conditions cooler conditions\nThere is a the chance of some sprinkle some remaining showers today for the Delmarva up through New Jersey and into New York city but again conditions will be improving\nWe've got a chance for some snow and portions of the central plains from South Dakota into Nebraska and over to central Iowa there'll be snow just north of the line and then I rain snow mix and as we get\nSouth into the system into Kansas and portions of western Missouri we'll see thunderstorms developing all rain but as you move into Oklahoma and central Texas light showers from the system bears a look at your National Weather forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eyes [noise]\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi\nAnd the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now\nDemocrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the top ... district still remains at thirty two already too yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number or for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\n[noise] so\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecideds\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact\nOf the capital and that entire\nThing and really made me look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before ... ... with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and so ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of the ... the average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and I guess historically can shift happened\nAh with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race\nOr the the uh you know test her up by\nBy four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they call like a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error what's ... ... it's not a toss up\nThat's my point my point is it's our sleepy has it as definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map but still showing great it's just when gray\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just went grey eye thanks to the staff at our sleepy for listening to read I read it was it that way of what happened that just when it just went gray yeah\nAll right I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and what I had was from a week ago or something but it just went great sense now I tiny brain asked myself I got no wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and they'll look at the end when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden updates Edwards gray in front of me that\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nAir Arizona was like blue would slash is or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because of mix Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because Mick Sally there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from All right I'm going to al Marri Sienna ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R. C. P. Senate map and the one next week is the Senate know toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught sub Senate that's what I was okay that's what I was I had no difference if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it it makes sense now\nBecause I was like wait a how can you call a can't Montana not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way that the wrong map out the the New York times CNN poll this life\nPull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now ah on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhich was a political that did the article on bread ascendant and his volunteers right furious that the fact that he said he would have endorsed Kavanaugh ...\nWell something's happening there yeah I mean you see this in in the CNN poll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and brought us in was a five but all these the polls the recent polls\nAre from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll\nA ten eight to ten eleven or the New York times Seattle for teen point lead\nFor the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nNuts massive ... in a month that is a Nineteen point swing yeah that's huge definitely is huge\nAre your calls and comments coming up eight six
