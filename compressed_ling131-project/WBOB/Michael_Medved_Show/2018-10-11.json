well\nI it's not I I could do it\nAnd the thing is I ... now that I Would want to do something like that ... it's not a possibility it's not something I even ever thought of when I was young it's like before though doing what they do in the weather channel or being a meteorologist like bad which\nIsn't the average meteorologist out there let's be honest I mean what they are they're\nNot the vast majority of meteorologist but before that uh I I\nThat's not the vast majority meteorologist but before that uh I I you know and as I got older I would've loved to be a geologist and I really would have loved to study volcanoes now I took I actually took geology geology course in college and I got a DNA Mm I no interest in it at all not rise zero\nAnd I would love to do it today and I started thinking as I get older I'm thinking to myself\nWow what would I you know what what some of the things I Would have loved not I don't regret anything I Love the way I Love the way that my life has gone let's just make that clear but you start thinking some of the other things that I can love if I could you know that I really love if I could have a few lives\nAnd I thought to myself you know it's coming it's I'm thinking of geology and thinking of you know and you know what they do in the weather channel and thinking you know nature and everything else in what did I Choose I sit in a box knife in the late into from nature with me [laughter] with you and and\nAre that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should become a talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane\nI mean right now they're just insane and so people in the look and they say okay you know we're what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree with that but ah\nHe's not insane like they are over there I mean I really think it's worth a [laughter] when you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to a an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's\nRational thought and critical thinking to it mhm\nRight well and and they and we and we do hear that from time to time but I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand how you get there a central right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals\nWho call and want to have a saying discussion on the issues\nBut no\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know what they're looking at their party\nAnd asking well how do we actually win something and then move forward we think about the word progressive that's the whole idea right of taking the country to its next step that's a great\nPoint they're still using progressive down things so\nThat there's no way you can when they're saying get in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress the answer is it's not it's it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what is just come to this week\nWith the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know to win an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments on the substance of the ideas\nThey are lost\nAnd it's just pure range and emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe

I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in the\nPrimary would have won twenty sixteen he won the state um do you look at a also now look there was a period or where especially right around the convention time [noise]\nPlenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got he bowed right and and the word from Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans\nAre at one point so this is someone a Ted Cruz is someone who gets the benefit I think maybe a to a greater degree than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party\nThan someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party\nYou know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more uh than than others might\nSo I I'm it'll be interesting I think to\nTo really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWell yeah and and ... house races we can tell because there's that you do look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside\nTheir campaign they do\nBecause they're doing the inside the\nInside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having her and her Mitchell meeting their little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks ... or no pay out in two weeks you look at the\nTop ... the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups or categorize to stuff that's\nThirty two according to our sleepy and they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats\nAnd I have to wonder what has changed after the Kavanaugh hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts keep in mind a number of those districts uh the race is is on\nTo fill a seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean as the makeup of that district changing and we looked at Texas thirty two\nUh that is uh the uh Pete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district are changing\nYou know um that's that's something that well changes politics\nAnd it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all over this Dallas County in Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a Obama and two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district\nOr buy a point and a half and I believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions and see right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point\nBut he's been you know he's been somebody who has been a strong contender and years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change\nI I'm you know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing\nHad you know well what kind of it it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have ... and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day and and uh also has now said it's a toss up our sci fi says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three ... and early September he was up by two by late September he was up by four but that was the latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens\nIn you know that state\nAs we get closer ah ah Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent in any of the the polling ah a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his I'm\nA ... for example he was a plus for and that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was a margin of two so he's over but now it's\nA Senate race it's listed as a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\n\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana mhm\nAfter everything that we obscene and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere they you know I'd but we played on yesterday show the comments I'm\nThe former attorney general ... are being played you know a well if they go low will kick them from Eric Holder mhm\nThey're being played or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that Democrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice\nBy the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick 'em oh it would be the number one story\nAnd the mainstream media right\nSo you you see the strategy that they have which is not a strategy of expanding their base\nBecause it's not claiming you're going to be you know uncivil claiming that it claiming as we said during the whole cabinet thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else that didn't agree with them is\nThat's what Republicans or anybody else that didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process and a presumption of innocence urine enablers ... your ... you weren't able uh uh a rape is that is what you do mhm\nThat's the message that they set out I I ...\nIf that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed\nIf that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path that we are doomed as

Washington Post reporter was assigned a story\nBy their editors to go see what really happened when Dianne Feinstein and Feinstein and her staff said the sort of questions that would have happened if the Republican Party had done the same thing not one and I and I challenge the New York times reporters this morning not reporters editors\nI uh I just think it's so great that that this is what it's that this is what has come to I mean I I Love the fact that it is oh so they have to that that this is the best you've got because\nThink about the Hollywood Reporter I mean most people aren't going to read it it really is for that thirty mile zone or most of the most don't even pay attention to it it's all about well [noise]\nReporting on Hollywood apparently and most people don't really care if they want to know the real Hollywood they go to the um the um but then but [laughter]\nAnd and the or Breitbart um\nThe but the the effect of it because then it's picked up by you know by the other media of course Stephen Miller himself on his own Twitter\nOne of these things is true that is a visual response between the loan or being a loner and eating glue I Love it he just leave the hanging out there for people um and he's got a great sense of humor I I've been following gone on Twitter for a while\nUm but he makes very solid points and also shows how ridiculous the left is\nYou don't have to you don't have to call them out they call themselves up they really do 'cause a store like this this is Ben carried on by the mainstream media and social media\nAnd they really do call themselves out I mean they believe they're winning they believe this is going to be a Hillary Clinton\nJumps onto the you know a no more civility bandwagon and sodas Eric Holder the former H.

turn\nI radio he is currently and I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety a run I coming up on the bottom of the hour we will talk to the meteorologist\nOr a Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up a hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago or from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile an hour sustained winds and heading toward south\nCarolina yeah we'll hear from Tom uh\nHis take on on uh the ... this historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days uh as uh the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of\nTropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nComing up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb Pearl election day ... and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or was like two hundred pounds\nYou know uh you you go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nA talking about where the left has going and of course after his attack he knows all too well or what people will do when they're politically motivated but talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be on\nThe SAT there might be an assassination or in another attempted assassination or we go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting of Steve's beliefs\nAnd how that was as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast brought you buy video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but\nThe system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia most of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nOnly about two to four inches of rain however\nAs the system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd we have a frontal boundary coming in and out of Canada metal usher in some cooler drier air for those regions that pick up this rainfall\nA low pressure area moving east we're now on the western side of the Rockies but moving east where it will be dumping some snow into portions of dumb brass SCA and central Iowa south of that snow line will see the chance for heavy rain and thunderstorms today\nFor eastern Kansas and western Missouri your national forecast ... radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety or read I [noise]\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's that's just simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October\nWhen you consider that there's been four of them total and and so and it'll last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it\nIt's something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power as it comes into shore and and I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah yeah I\nCan you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know turn tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does is causes up boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd ah just letting you know [laughter] not a good or Easter season right\nIn your state or the came in and Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and came came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place style and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop\nOf the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic\nAh is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time but Michael is acting\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that I ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to rally and Norfolk and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes to know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [laughter] yeah and and so\nI mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on in in in central North Carolina\nAnd so it never really picked up any news but when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk\nAnd Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right a pound power outages there's there's a huge swaths of it's going to be\nFrom power outage outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least to pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks islands\nI'm this is widespread power outages\nThen we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are normally super cells so were you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty\nAre heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta\nWell that's not likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where the feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where those individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the\nAh what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some ... some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John ... touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land\nOr it kind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week there half zeros and a half ones\nAnd um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um and they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm and four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west\nNorthwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean and the ...\nWhere we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City\nAnd northward toward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the ... the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one\nOr the winds are going to topple trees trees are going to topple power lines\nA power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas\nAnd possibly into a southern Virginia than we have flooding and that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of hills ... ravines and so forth ... and that all creates its own issue for the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise]\nAnd and then beyond that treat toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing [noise]\nUm you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm and it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the uh [noise] hadn't for the other side of the pond\nWhile while just incredible energy behind the storm and of course uh just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts to rise in what is\nNow that that path that the that Michael took a and I\nWere just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting\nJust looking at at one ... uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of several hundred yeah uh uh being affected here and they they said it for some of them it could be weeks\nUh I I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas\nA and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have a power again by coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with you Tom\nWe appreciate your time and we'll talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of the next hour thank you looking forward to our meteorologist Tom hale with us this morning\nAnd he'll be with us ah each hour at the bottom of the hour just to kind of recap what ah what happened with Michael and again what to expect in the coming days eight six six Ninety read I\nTalked with what I told him that he ... he wrote\nA shop thousands of trucking
