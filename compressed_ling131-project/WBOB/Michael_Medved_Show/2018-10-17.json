I guess or someone is administration will allow that and the rules and speaking of ah who you'd like let's go and see who felt likes in Cleveland Philip Iran with mark\nMark really mean to you know I Want to first of all sorts of ... refer somebody was said while ago about if a\nTrump or out and dance game vice president that the speaker of the house will become much president that's not the way it works speaker of the house is second in line to the President's Day after the uh the by spread\nActually thirty he's thirty right after vice president you may not have heard me I corrected that in the last hour just didn't want to get robbed him at the time I live near\n... and which also would would would scare me a little bit if Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house so that would really be a a scary thing of what happened but uh you know we talk about the Democratic nominee you know a Joe Biden\nHe had a copy the speech of new Cannick a British\nThat was yeah I mentioned to plagiarize ... yeah I Do remember that in\nAlmost word for word there I'll tell you who I who I Would and I'm I'm a conservative but I Do I Would think would would be a good person to run on the Democratic side would be a\n\nWe lose and he he's a former secretary the navy ... Republican president\nHe's a former structure the navy ... and a ... ...\nWho is that we didn't we didn't catch you you you you got cut off who was that\nWas Jim Webb\nWhen I was a former governor and he's a former U.S secretary of the navy and uh\nI just I don't think he would have a chance to ... the Democrat Party is so\nMove away from men like him Sam ... was the former senator that I could have voted for looked at seriously as a presidential candidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat but ... but\nHe he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like ... ... he he's a good man as\nAs interesting and is it would work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as sex or the ...\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nOh yeah I Love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a more so I Would enjoy that I wouldn't do anything you would if he would let me call and if he was listening and then and then and not\nYou know not just a demagogue everything I I like him his personality I don't want you to me that he believes in but uh\nIt would be ... ... ...\nDo you know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have these stories of Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny so it is\nBut I thought you know it's like hey Philip thanks for the call appreciate it\nThank your mark ... program\nThank you so much I buy oh and here's someone's going to lie I think is going to ask me right away in Las Vegas you're on with mark ...\nYeah I think the one I wouldn't want to have coffee with is Dina Titus now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred vote to show and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman\nAnd I I really do think that a nut Titus could approve of all the dirty tricks in terrible thing the Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't as to\nElections stuff is over because I'm sure she's appalled is a lot of those cars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah that was going to have coffee it was so deep Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she could have proof of any of these okay\n... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call you didn't follow the rules of the game you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's the head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six

forecast from Rhode Island radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm all for Gary interests will be back with this Sunday night Monday morning I Want to know who is your choice for president running again from who you would have coffee with mark I turn on red Iranian [noise]\n\nWell ... run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in needs that Hammond, Indiana\nI wanted to speak to the question of\nIn Indiana\nI wanted to speak to the question of all across the treaty will record 'em knowing much rural or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nOur moral reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't violate\nAll remember all the sort of saw the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both the enhanced interrogation was on multiple\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecute the leader of the leaders of the ... the former nutrition leaders of the other party because our our politics have become too hostile\nAs it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical to our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law\nIs only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what the what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she ...\nThe Justice Department but I'll give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam committed treason could obviously committed treason yeah we do not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talks in the last I didn't quite say that but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I preach old who could you have coffee with\nOn the other side or when it probably\nI Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh he's bright guy yeah he's he's things things are good you did you pass the test\nYou did very well thanks so much here I Am I Can't stay with Tucker across that have you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but this is interesting because\nI could you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting animals go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\n\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning\nI uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard righteous Joe\nAnd has a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just might be for me um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty then certainly should be locked up um\nBut right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant\nAnd when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his math the lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee I wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to tip to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength\nAnd she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little spray with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so uh she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking ah his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you know like for more people like him to rise and I don't want to see Joe Biden run again\nUm I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nIt I I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but\nUm you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah\nGreat point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about I don't know ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't share a committee or just ... it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I made it that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to meet tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to let me know what you think's or asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys a surprise me it just of all that question but you're surprised me 'cause you're picking people on the other side\nThat you admired least could sit down and talk with so let me know what you think about that to mark I are sitting in on red I
