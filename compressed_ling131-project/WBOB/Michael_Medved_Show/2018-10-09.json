I I guess I guess the point that I'm asking\nIs is it in ... and ... is\nThe Republicans are the majority one and the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was there to be a ... that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats or what is their issue that they can use\nTheir point there is well what would there be how do you spend a good economy because what else matters to people what else matters if you're going to work every day you\nGot a solid job and possibly even offers\nOn the table immigration is not an issue they could use I still believe that they can illegal immigration they can't\nWrite to not an issue right it's not it's not\nYou know the whole thing or what what was going on at the borders you know months ago earlier this year that didn't even resonate with the American people because they looked at the facts surrounding that and so how do you what are you spending here you cannot spend a good economy there's no way to spin it into a negative [noise]\nThe borders well even if that situation [noise] war right now if we were overwhelmed that would help Republicans they say illegal immigration is out of it I guess we'll see maybe organizing is [noise]\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I like the the wife cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas station is going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be flying you can damage your car you know a a faster\nYou could damage your lawn mower faster if you use the Fifteen mhm right that it should just be ... percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so it's just the way the president just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farmers\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work\nEven with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that ... the benefit those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down to the consumer right\nSo the mandate is on the blend here's my question if the mandate is on the ... right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent\nBut those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting out let's say they responded to the incentive of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or the gasoline soul would would have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol concept\nOn the market what would happen with the consumer\nMany of the consumers will be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temperature right\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have done this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states\nBut it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get an e Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get ... on board [laughter] to help you vote for him and he's a farmer himself [laughter] so [laughter]\nWait a minute he's only trying to scratch grass leaves and back [laughter] [laughter] that's what everybody is paying out they just now when I met you I didn't think about at MSNBC leader story tomorrow or is he dropped out trying around [laughter]\nSorry Mr Trump didn't mean to start that story for you but ah I did I mean I when I read it I'm thinking well this doesn't do anything and you're just a it's a Fifteen that his band in the summer months\nThey do have the eight Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not it is not mandated well the the question is is that\nIf the city's believe like Los Angeles\nOr states like California who through the California air resources board I could see them coming in because you know a Houston and in Los Angeles compete or for the number one ah a spot in terms of the smog easiest city\nOr they don't want the eight Fifteen on the market they're not going to want to be Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing um but the but [laughter] it bart but the\nThe problem is ultimately they won't want more smog and they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's going to fly they\nWould probably want to get ahead of it legally by going after the EPA or if the rule or exemption is but here's your here's the difference ... is president going to come out tomorrow and say I'm doing this because of global warming\nWell I don't know why you know he's not a lot to do it as a rice helping the farmers right we're we're ... we're helping helping Chuck Grassley [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent they're making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't I don't expect anyone\nTo sell something when it's going to be promoted instantaneously if it comes to fruition after tomorrow and you're going to see it bombarded all over the Internet over newspapers it ever was mandated number one that would be fury right or as especially from members of of of Congress\nBut he's not doing it because of global warming he's doing it because he's he's doing it because of a\nWishing to to help the farmer right right which we send to begin with that's not how you run industry you don't have that Herman setting ten percent mandates to begin with because the president's made it clear ... you know he I think he would do a mandate mhm and had taxpayer subsidized more\nJust to help the farmers an economy shouldn't run that way well and what\nWe had a he knows he can't get that

talked about the the\nObama administration the one thing that they brought up more than anything was the biggest problems were race and climate change and then it all the studies that were done and we went over this I don't know dozens of times during the Obama administration on the radio right where they would lift the top twenty five but the top thirty problems\nThe things always on the bottom of the list was race and climate change him from the perspective of people looking at it but\nThey afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers it's drawn to become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with they because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather

American people how much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so\n\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael\nMhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh Charlotte and that's why like I said during lumbering if you want to check out his stuff uh\nHe writes them great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong\nBut do we have an ... interesting perspective do we have an impact of course we have an impact\nBut we're part of this life cycle here on this planet yes I Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write again I don't think anybody really knows you can take a guess but the average Joe on the average Joe I'm not a\nA you know atmospheric science a scientist but ah from what I've read they don't know because the predictions are always wrong mhm\nThere are things that we could measure in the past that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you do talk to them in terms of pollution\nParticularly ... matter yeah I could you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up a that is put on the American\nPeople are with out that kind of of evidence and discussion I

hearing Mac him or eight six six Ninety right either go to Justin in Kansas Justin\nWelcome you're on ... radio we talked about the president is that the up and I'll plan earlier you're on red eye Hi\nGood morning guys how are we here at All right well\nOne of the reasons they start incorporating ethanol or allow all into the fuel was that they used to use what was called MTV leveled tribunal ethylene\nAn anti ... anti knocking writer in doubt it yeah it turned out it was a carcinogenic and put out into the air so\nThey started replacing out with at all alcohol\nYou can't have two hundred proof alcohol it tiger Scott it absorbs moisture from the air soloist you're going to get it's like maybe one Ninety five one Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland however alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy\nRight around him as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's screwing the consumers ... doing yeah\nWell look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talked about this report without that all four of the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a temper send exists\nNo the ... percent mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we're number look we've not\nOur problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry to have that kind of monopoly a great government dictates All right you need to do this for the well what's the reason\nWell for global warming but what's the reason now to make sure you have a job mhm for video robot here's your forecast\nHurricane Michael lives a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now forecast to be a dangerous major hurricane when it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center the forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from\nBetween one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes\nLife threatening storm surge is almost imminent along most portions of the Florida coast in the Big Bend area we'd be looking at two well built framed homes incurring major damage trees can be snapped in these kind of wins\nWe're looking at uprooted trees on electricity being out potentially for several days the water on availability we've seen it all before and most recently with Hurricane Florence landfall expected in just over twenty four hours from now\nAnd there's a look at tracking hurricane Michael on red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trapper\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director uh you're you're a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to\nTo to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassified or not and I say you were secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies\nThey're not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa\nLook at this but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to get this to the inspector general the apartment of justice\nThan you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said that acts but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud ah around during the election and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly as well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusion from this information by ... classifying it and we see the ... act that information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive\nBranch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a ... that apartment of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz it's the only way because beyond that\nYou're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even\nThat could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while our air supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... or which\nIs someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of\nWhat the inspector general is designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report ah on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nYou're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case or the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and then part late into the Russian investigation and all of that\nNow when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now horror with having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lends support to this new investigation\nAnd it's I think interesting and I think very key that the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happened that you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed are familiar with the matter a bully even and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that\nHe believes there is possible perjury in the fact that ah the Pfizer warrant and supporting documents with the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted accent me on redacted\nWhen everything was open up and declassified so everybody can see it bull how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the trio twos and the communications between the higher ups\nThe FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release this Mr President because if you released is it will be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released in what they want to really solve it\nNope if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either some being extremely wrong or crimes had been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have but he can go look for anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case he has access to the documents that the that the ...\nThe oversight committees could not get from the FBI there is no process that stops Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI had tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information another major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nOr any it does to eat the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the put no really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report can be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking\nIt's some information in September twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking and possible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker wood bat at an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nThe Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat in an unclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unbearable fight salacious dot CA by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice\nThese these things aren't top secret about national defense you know it's about covering their posterior otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it and an unclassified betting that was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on here and we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported story really in the mainstream media today and that's it and thanks to Sarah a quarter and Solomon and some others you know the story remains alive but asked the question\nWhere's the story of Russian collusion and the
