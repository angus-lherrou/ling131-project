in jail for carrying a non law a weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe mayhem remembered that because that was a defining moment in his lap and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her she could not tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd\nYou know if it was such a defining moment in her life how did you get home where was this house\nThat would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment\nAnd now all of a sudden it's just let's move to go post maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exempt or his whole lab and for the presumption of innocence could be just thrown out the window by the Democrats are just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible it so you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exist and their testimony and when the ... or whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there ... and when those witnesses or act in the ass and say\nSorry we weren't there don't know about it about that at all and even one of her friends\nThe ass and say sorry we weren't there don't know about it about that at all and even one of her friends at that point your credibility starts falling apart and when do I don't know the where the\nWin or about how\nOf everything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the PRP or at that at that point you have problems yes you do have credibility problems in any case and not just this case in any case you would have had complete and total credibility problems which is what the\nProsecutor said yes and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a case together based on all the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards but it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat were at that party or had a first hand some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories mimic what she was saying now\nYou still go through that process and you which is exactly what the FBI is doing has been doing since last friday\nOr Saturday but this is what you this is the process of building that ... well yeah I mean every case is not even if you look at her claim it's not being backed up by anything except Democrats take it and run with it saying I Believe her\nAnd you see the goalposts moving now even as the the two callers ago uh well uh he acted on professional [noise]\nUh you know and that's what that's what you got I mean by the way that was a talking point from ... to that caller's a talking point from two three days ago you need to be as an OB GYN points yeah sides not use that and I've gone [noise]\nAs cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as a legitimate\n\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth\nRight her attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act\nOn investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh quote it is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are debris cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials enter a letter obtained by\nPolitical uh again\nIt's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talked with the end\nAnd also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't I understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check\nOn Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or tapping ought to get their statements because they had their statements by the way\nThere is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys\nDon't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't including people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with this the FBI may be\nDoing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her\nThis is a background check on Capitol Hill about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does it there there is a no there is no right for them to be a part of the process\nFor them to be included or directing the process\nI Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with the background check process you may we may not ever know\nThe American people may not know cabinet or may not know who they talked to who\nInterview and and political here I'm running from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background check as the timeframe for completion of the ...\nIt ... it's not an investigation it's a background check as the timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney ... call later Tuesday with your officials to discuss the investigation you don't get to do that and it's not an investigation it's a background check\nAnd it's not about her it's not about Dr Ford it's not about it's about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they are going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she\nDoesn't get a copy of the background check I Know only the senators do that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI final\nUh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer press for the public release other redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nWrite I write a which will be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week on Kavanaugh's nomination\nAccording to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report in a secure studying for the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed he said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nA an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or half\nWhore a partial part of the transcript that would be damning mhm uh you know to a to a cabin on in the context of not the complete\nParagraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released a holding released the entire thing so I'm\n\nA C\n\nYeah I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out late in the day on Tuesday but the investigation is winding down\nThen by the way down ... yes [laughter] thank you well no no but we but my point is like the records investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is phrasing it yes\nAnd we're joined it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's ... ... because that's what they wanted they wanted a criminal investigation that was never going to happen it was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear direct evidence and scope on in terms of the timeline\nYou've got to get it done in seven days so of course\nIf it's done let's say the the interviews are done with a report still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down now and and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday than the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAnd that likely will take what I'm at least a day\nAnd they all were then we went we we've been told that they can get it on the earliest today later on today yeah\nWell if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI\nThat would compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews so it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are\nBut the point being is that it it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's it would be a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each interview\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing\nIf you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I

Bush\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut Robert Reich rhinos rentals started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos on the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough and the budgets when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone wouldn't that was it that uh that\nThat that uh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty\nThirty oh that that was a that would have been a present that out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring sort of only get so it was before this one or two of election right yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's\nUnacceptable now we give the president credit or do in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but the tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shot down the shutdowns of never been about tax cuts the shutdowns have been about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were called ... recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp stop the spending to stop the sand and even\nGoing back to the the uh the school lunch program you know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you're that goes back he's so much for when he got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and uh a banner was leaving and Ryan was coming in Bangor didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he\nWas automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the ... the the president back then\nFurious they wanted him out Trump Scott to Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos south to swap out we've got to cut spending liquor we are today so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party in in just a you know roughly a three year some ... well\nRemember leap go back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket\nFor conservatives street cred\nRemember you know the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate and it was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart you know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was it was still early but but if Romney\nIf if he's the nominee 'cause it was it was still early but it but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on him and his answer basically was ... because ... which wide awake rings so\nTrue right now does today as thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words but I think it's important but yeah I mean look at history and and see what why anyone swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything on ... being a rhino and being a but now it's changed mhm\nBut back three years ago yeah swamp of the state now but yeah a swamp is deep state a swamp is what's going on right down the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think nobody I use the Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation aboard the Republican Party has gone you know we're you know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of\nWhat those terms meant back three years ago and the fact that the definition has about completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you are going to we're going to ... we're going to cut as to where they are today because that's simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure at their pressure right now on spending\nOn Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all of that would have been done it would've been a priority and the president is not wrong for focusing on national security and and border control\nBut it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the matter is that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away\nWe just want the penalty to go away and\nWe said litter the but look at the polling from five years ago\nOr until they were discussing it last year and you could see the ... I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and let the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no bad there's no ... there's a small core as what are we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it and maybe twenty to thirty\nRepublicans in Congress outside of that you you there's no base to even start from now the conservatives don't control the party you know eight six six Ninety read I\nCook with what you told me he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio show hotel on making your hardworking journeys more\nManageable to keep you trucking cc are tiresome services\nDedicated to providing high speed tire sir cutting edge to thousands of devoted service\nOver Fifteen hundred service try five minute a lineman town [laughter] we could keep going on and on but\nThirty seconds so let's just say we're upset at all our hundred and sixty bus tours\nSee service different do you see our towers dot com\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and the fish get bored and you make sure you're illegal\nCompliance I Will find your operation\nOn the track dot com or red eye radio show dot com forward slash ... back\n[noise]\nOwner operators we know everyone has flatbed free these days to make the best for your business in Mercer transportation help you take advantage of that phrase with no company frogs Mercer is to make it through our owner operators success we have passed over forty years experience an offer a dedicated coordinator unhealthy manager at all\nSo you can focus on on in your business if you're looking to make a move considered Mercer transportation rock solid owner operator driven for over forty years visit today at Mercer town dot com or\nRed eye radio in our sponsors are devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting drivers who surpass the million mile mark with preventable accident free driving\nBy reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving without a preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's red eye radio show dot com", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "03"}
