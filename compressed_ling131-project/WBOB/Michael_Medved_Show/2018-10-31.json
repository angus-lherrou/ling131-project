don't win the house she's going to move to Canada I thought all the celebrities will be out as soon as they said hey pot legal\nWell here's the thing what she's saying that in January 'cause right now you know if you look at nature civil first five thirty eight then ah okay there you know what I mean is that one of those same things\nTo say she no she doesn't have to leave right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leave best right luckily we are bad luck we know the Democrats going to take the house we know about okay I'm going to make this proclamation well but what does she\nThink is the you know I mean what's what would be the the\nThe goal of saying that I mean what do you think that is going to do that people are gonna go man we better get out and vote for a Democrat otherwise Barbra Streisand's gonna move to Canada\nYes I Can't live in a country that bad doesn't live in\nI Can't I Can't [laughter]\nI I just I Can't I Can't well but that's I mean because that's really if

of right there\nThe letters that were sent now the castor bean themselves were not talk show but it doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were live explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to CNN right we know that was not\nA but when you look at it\nWhen you look at the reaction of the media to similar instances one and and those are the these are envelopes sent to the politicians in power right now\nTwo appointed individuals' in our military and the CIA\nWas there anything on CNN where they were blaming the left\nNot was there anything on Fox where they were blaming the left for no no it was just quiet the story came out of people moved ... you know people moved on mhm\nSaid OK yeah brought brought back memories we talked about uh brought back memories of nine eleven and then we moved on a good looks like they caught the guy but now the charges officially filed\nLast week during all the the\nUh uh\nCoverage of a you know the um the mail bomb scare ...\nWere they treated the same by the media for those were not biased we're not biased you can be biased by including one story and making accusations against one party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all and you would know or the other story mhm\n\n[noise] yeah I mean it it was not it it it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say and that's it\nNow it's a given that high profile individuals politicians and presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts it's why the secret services in place or for presidents\nAnd it's why most people even if they're not serving the public there the even in the private sector or they're they have a high level very high level of security but the point is is that the the media went\nAll over\nWhen it works for when they believe it works for their side\nThey stay on it for a long long time they will it ... it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around and the other side is targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a ... of what happened dusty skull east and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that something a Don limited CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nYeah yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah yeah and ... are they a ... a ... you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hateful and spiteful about rhetoric in and bring it up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly what they proceed to do\nWas to ah MSNBC is a a\nContributor Steve Schmidt ... said conservative radio host like rush and mark Levin have blood on their hands for mass shootings at other crimes perpetrated by crazy people he also included judicial watch news busters judicial watch Breitbart judicial watch\nWhere does your just judicial watch\n[laughter] or they do is to get the elimination to the people they're not ... if you look at what judicial watch is about getting information specifically documents right documented evidence or information to the American people\nOh oh oh\nForget it [laughter] and we can't have that [laughter] that see because\nThe point would be from the left while you are you know ... your your part of the problem so you get people motivated by how well the world\nWould judicial watch could get someone motivated to do something violent and\nAny of the others by the way out for mentioned in yet within that list but right you can't put judicial watch up in terms of controversy the only controversy there is the only debate there is between the people who want the truth of the people who don't\nIn terms of why they exist and their attempt in their mission statement\n\nHas anybody ever debated anything that they have been able to uncover any documents\nThat they have been ... been able to ah to essentially bring to light well I heard that uh you know mark Levin dissected the fourteenth amendment and the constitution today so certainly he has blood on his hands rise explaining the Constitution's ...\nHow dare he [laughter]\nWell but here's the thing by the way people do a mark works for the same company that we ... but the people know that but yes mark 'em but so no one at a MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response now no\nOkra no just [noise] or you would have to come out and and then accused them of of course being responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field\nOn that day ... was shot\n\nI ... if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to ... there's no way to ignore that you can try to ignore that but you just look stupid doing yeah but I what I just\nLove and ... is the fact that as they denounced the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder [laughter] they just gave it up with wild and in sane and crazy accusation\nThe wild and in sane and crazy accusation ...\nYeah well what Michael Moore say rabbit I wrap it up so here you go that's response will wrap it up\nThat's ridiculous so uh so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media they will respond to have to go the right to have to go\nFree speech is the problem or anything that that any of these individuals who are actually responsible for this anything that they participate in\nThis response right\nWell know anybody that they disagree with\nRight yeah well I mean I'm Talking about if if this person ... saying that your you know that that uh that that talk radio\nAnd by the way the way he

Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law this is Congress except the with the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty to the justice is to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship but it didn't include it in any Congress person or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if Scott us were to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly Ina decision I don't think there's going to happen but if they were to do that would that normal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nThey fit is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the citizen all ... all day to fourteenth amendment is clearly defined if the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said\nNo here's what it says then the what Congress did in ... it would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that law also right that they could one one ...\nAnd and that's the ... much means that there's much you know what you have to get past that part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't ... I don't think they're going to get to defining a very clearly what they based on interpretation\nWho the ... look at us his ship clause applies to a new look it up a gun lawsuits over the last ... probably a a you know two hundred and forty years of the country in them to two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court\nFinally said the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right even though to me was absolutely clear that it was an individual right as it was too many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought go back to the federalist papers and you could figure that out quite easily and still it wasn't defined for over two hundred and Thirty years one eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with what I told you so much he wrote a [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles been registered to joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dad come red eye radio and our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested that were led is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and top tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nFor information on tour stop avenged and promotions if you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be injured when great prices at hash\nTag tack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nAttention owner operators tired and chasing empty promises RSVP it looking for you to join Thirteen offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for some of the drivers or two dollars per mile for teams are asked me ... ... that had an back\nHome or not in their vocabulary they're no treatment rentals needed some secrets are I think the today not only in eight RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three six five four apply online at R.

bottom of the hour we'll look we will get to it I'm I'm Still going through some of the the reason why young people don't vote from New York magazine dot\nCom yeah because a mailing things\nReady for this gives me anxiety Laura age Twenty one or land or Florida has never voted in high school I didn't even know or vice presidents name was Joe Biden my high school classmates were Republicans super very vocal about it especially during the whole Romney and Obama election I realized I didn't believe everything that they were saying\nThen I Google Republican versus Democrat I like kind of both kind of not that's why I'm an independent it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realize how important it was to vote maybe had to do with\nLike society and all\n... every maybe every one I was following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go through the long process run out of state student to register to vote I had a hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy\nIt's just not that important also I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing 'cause my brother does not bode either so it wasn't asked if they could to help us out with the registration and mailing all the forms to us\nSo she doesn't want to get by with their parents with it a mom is a Republican and my dad as a Democrat [laughter]\nI Wonder if she's never bought a concert tickets on line [laughter] you know you asked yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets right\nOh voting oh no no mailing things gives me anxiety toward preview who wrote in law he's your forecast\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday look for mountain snow in the southern and Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry\nThere is a look at your mid week National Weather forecast from ... radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point\nThe the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they\nYou know delusional scenario 'cause it's not going to happen but I'm saying they couldn't do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to differ and say no sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion in Nineteen eighty Ninety eighty when there wasn't a precedent that was that\nIt was an opinion the opinion Lee in that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do lower courts can do that and the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law\nThat clearly is and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly\nNot being viewed by modern society as the makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in at times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah now a federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was state precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah yeah\nThank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that\n... the\nThe argument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou hear that if if they were to take this case that if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion\nI'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact but the impact remember is on\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens in in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even though we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point to a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply\nThat's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and\nScreamed the word temporary how many different times\nBecause the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was you know again it was played out and ended in a different\nThan a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to be it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said what\nCongress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never thought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have all judges even construction is judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say\nWell there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over\nA fight going on constantly for that and constant president being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about\nA specific type of\nBehavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law and a different state\nAnd they might look at it and said this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought it's been accepted\nThe way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their opinion of the Supreme Court and a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would\nThat's what I think where I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a law can be passed it will be vegan somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged\nWell and and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges\nIf it's a new challenge that's never at a new challenge me he said no one has ever stepped up to ... oh I agree I agree with you on that is why it took two hundred Thirty years to get\nYou know that guns are and and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country yeah trendy Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of right what about the parents who aren't here ...\nBut the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that ... made the claim that they have that at three in court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge ... and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically\n... that's the problem right well it hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one shot to to find that claws well\nI agree with you I Will leave without question you have somebody on a ... look\nOr you know when when you see that when if I was a judge and I say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm going to flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first to men or the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's\nIn the federalist papers what were the\nAs many of the justices ... the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that you know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't ate it isn't a law that is written specifically there\nIs no specific the it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] and uh they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in there mhm it really does because\nThe argument would be made then and this case coming from the other side well if if [laughter] if ah Jacob powered the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended to be\nSuch than the citizenship clause should have been written in ... exactly and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill ... members of Congress wrote that amendment that got passed what would that there's nothing else you can really go on\nYou have to go on that if you're a journalist and I agree I disagree and I don't know what Gorsuch her cabinet or anybody else would do I don't know how they would we review it it was shocking to me when they came out and said you know\nFirst Amendment is our Second Amendment\nA protection individual's right to bear arms because it took so long and I would like to be a legal scholar and just focus on that and see\nEverything that they've gone through over the last you know two hundred and Thirty years before we got to that point right eight six six
