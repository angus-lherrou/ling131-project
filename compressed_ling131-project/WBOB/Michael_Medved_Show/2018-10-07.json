I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughters and a wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nAre either of those events\nThe vote if right now the Republican Party\nUm and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you look at at ah at lake in his comments about the report they seem to be I guess indicating that he still could be a guest wrote I'm assuming that's the case or columns as as well Manchin is on the fence\nAnd the latest we saw I think mentioned had what a nine point lead in his state um it\nDoes he think you know he's uncomfortable territory [noise]\nEnough to the point that he can vote you know remember\nNine point isn't a given [noise] we still have about four and a half weeks before the election headache can turn quickly if he votes no and he knows [noise]\nGreg Abbott um that's you know again he's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of work is trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get ... he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas and hope to get elected and that's the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we\nNeed to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about ten years ago right now\nWhen you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would have been the convention\nWhere the convention when ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up when these pillars mhm and everything else where he look quite like some Greek forum yes yes ... and ... and people going crazy and and remember and his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight yeah he's he's a ... you'd always a post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country mhm I\nRide on Obamacare and we don't they not only do we not only do we don't need about death\nSo they don't have the Hollywood they talk about that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that is directly in inside the state it doesn't work but\nA work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals you know we've been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz\nUm you know so you know he wants the liberal basically fill liberals to you guys stay outside of Texas look we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here's the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but then the banks of an ongoing ideas into us core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do anymore\nOh no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too\nIs that it does nothing for them\nAnd it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and sat right I mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's\nGoing to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base right\nThey don't care right we don't uh\nBecause Obama is yesterday's news well\nListen I mean I'm liar Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the hero of the moment the point is is not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor\nDoes the person standing next to you will have a new reason to Web victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's\nHere's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a ... bed or work here in the state of Texas so I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he liked being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nAnd by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not a president like him 'cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... item on sale predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or pillow she's getting old and you know ... to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party he's nothing anymore now\n... going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nIn July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching it the thing I remember the most\nThem saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was the beginning or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nAnd I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those uh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although we had started happening before that for me it was telling\nBecause you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American\nWas Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats that the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it ... it it always will be that's why the party has no direct\nI invited out that's what you get with identity politics because there is no there's no ... there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party happy in a particular political goal this is probably the closest to you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes if the\nActivists are are are going in multiple directions then then the party is led by them they're going to try and it was every direction and they have\nNo direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now you're nights the Democrats right eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and there are

as as they call it and uh back in two thousand nine Eric did the research on this earlier or a ... this morning and uh in two thousand nine that was the Democratic controlled Senate that came up with the protocol and this new rule\nThat what you learn in a background check stays private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that uh I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a that there was a a a special kind of background check\nOkay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual and your family and everything else the point being is that they're there to vet you okay and this case they're there to vet Brett Kavanaugh\nBut it could be that uh a neighbor says something or that Brett Kavanaugh used to play hopscotch or in his underwear\nWhich we all know to be true I think we can all agree on that\n[laughter] but [laughter]\nAnd he didn't use real shock but ... the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim\nThe reason the FBI is part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training in order to substantiate claims when they do so on a criminal investigation they\nFor the most part get it right but they hit the point being they have the resources muttering to get that done that's why you do that that's it's part of the process but there could be a claim let's just say one that's not backed up by any witnesses from\nSomething that happened decades ago about a nominee and then if the media got hold of it than it would turn into something that maybe didn't warrant that kind of attention because it didn't have anyone to back it up\nI'm I'm familiar with a ... million vaguely familiar\nBut now we know this answers the question why didn't Dianne Feinstein go forward to the FBI and include this in the original one of the other six bats\nThis this rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the

that a top FBI if they show met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks\nOf allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ... former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the ...\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow where colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed\nOr by testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources decline to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm and the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground\nAbout the FBI's use of news media in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI\nAbout FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation by the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nOn new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you had them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon\nTest to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the source to say he said they talked it they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure the upcoming days of the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOPEC largest producer is currently puppy in about ten point seven million barrels a day\nThe energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nUh the key insights this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from\nTrump now we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we beat ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that is exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me we're there for you\nRight we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding your military were were there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member bill pact member [laughter] very good deal back then the OPEC member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just want to make real quickly because we had talked about the new NAFTA agreement ... um the wild stuff she could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original ... [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who's a leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parks\nThe old NAFTA Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parks rules requiring more production in North America higher weight or higher wages for workers and potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these are rules may have little practical significance they talked to ... of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by ... to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but\nThey're not going to ship to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states and so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from studying at expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it and it's subtle along are we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you went to basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we said the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people well then was it all worthwhile\nAnd the farmer saying just days ago that you know their their bail out that they got their government money they don't want that they really do because that's not going to be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that\nSales would help eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe Detroit power train offers a fish and sea through innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "07"}
