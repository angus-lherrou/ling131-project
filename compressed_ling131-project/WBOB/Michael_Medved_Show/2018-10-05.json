the old the ex boyfriend of Dr Ford said that uh that uh she had coached a remember a a former uh uh\nFBI employee Monica mclane writes that she had coached her to take a polygraph test and then Monica Monica McLean came out the other day and said no that never happened right and update to that story this year just from the last hour\nA I Believe from a Wall Street journal or the headline is a\nFriend of Dr Ford felt pressure to revisit statements at issue a statement to the committee that she knew nothing about the alleged sexual assault by bread cabin up\nA friend up Christine of Ford told FBI investigators said she felt pressured\nBy Dr Ford's allies to revisit her initial statement\nThat she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by the by a teenager Brett Kavanaugh which she later updated just say she believed to but couldn't cooperate Dr Ford's accounting according to people with the ... with the ah the matter for a million with the matter\nLeland Kaiser who Dr Ford has said was president of the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties told investigators that Monica McClain\nA retired federal and bureau in the investigation agent and a friend of Dr Ford's had urged her to clarify her statement like I said who needs a soap opera right\nThe other people said the statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford's allies are and friends\nI'm working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident\nAs we're judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh's who Supreme Court nomination will be

any notion of claim that ms McLean pressured Elyn Kaiser to alter ms Kaiser's account of what she recalled concerning the alleged incident between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false so the plot thickens Sam interesting\nThat it was Wall Street journal just had that here in the last hour right there's\nThere's where we stand a and as we told you a earlier\nWas about you know we've talked about it before it's probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about him and it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally\nAnd and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went from\nZero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right we could not believe that somebody of color\nWould be listening to and more so be a fan of the van around right\nAnd you remember when it happened and so I sort of like laughing I was like well I I Can't ... this is it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system for me it\n\nRight on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage and bitterness I Believe it's probably still there today in this person yeah I have is just I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them\nSince grade school and we still connect on a\nFew times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us would ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many\nBut I'm not far let it wasn't even what I said it was that a black man like yeah we talked and of course it was a little bit about eight six six Ninety red eye\nWhen it comes to proper tire care and maintenance what can you do to improve fuel

I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughters and a wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nAre either of those events\nThe vote if right now the Republican Party\nUm and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you look at at ah at like in his comments about the report they seem to be I guess indicating that he still could be I guess what I'm assuming\nA that's the case or columns as as well Manchin is on the fence and the latest we saw I think mentioned had what a nine point lead in his state um it does he\nThink you know he's been comfortable territory [noise]\nEnough to the point that he can vote no remember\nNine points is in a given [noise] we still have about four and a half weeks before the election headache can turn quickly if he votes no and he knows [noise]\nGreg Abbott um that's you know again he's he's very well and the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle well\nThen and that's a bit of work is trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get ... he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we need to move\nTo the middle we need to move to the middle we gotta move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about\nTen years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would have been the convention\nWhere your convention when ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up when these pillars mhm and everything else where he look quite like some Greek forum yes yes ... and ... and people going crazy and and remember and his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight\nYeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading socialist candidates in the country ... ...\nWe don't know not only do we know we don't need a bomb death\nSo they don't have the Hollywood they come out that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that aesthetic ally in inside the state it doesn't work but a work has no problem\nTaking money from outside the state from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state but well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know he wants the liberal basically fill liberals to you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas by there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but then the ... I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do anymore\nI don't know that that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them\nAnd it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and chat right\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base right they don't care right we don't uh well because Obama's\nYesterday's news well listen\nI mean I'm a lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was the hero with among the point is and not the Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor\nThis the person standing next to you will have a new reason to Web victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's\nHere's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a ... bed or work here in the state of Texas so I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to like to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay I'll do eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not the president like him 'cause you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time he got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... item on sale predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else and Feinstein you know or or or pillow she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so would still be Obama that would be the leader of for a while of the Democratic party he's nothing anymore now\nGoing back to the ... the tragic night here in Dallas in July twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course but they were talking to the leaders of the protest\nAssociated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most is them saying\nDoes Obama done for us to remember this was before you twenty sixteen months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nAnd I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those uh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it would have had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats ... the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's melting irrational right and it ... it it always will\nBe that's why the party has no direct line by right out that's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there's no ... there was there was no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody get when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims\nAnd therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party happy in a particular political goal this is probably the closest to you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh yes if the\nActivists are are are going in multiple directions then then the party has led by them they're going to try and there was every direction and they have no direction at all except for

the Senate Judiciary committee released an executive summary late last night\nOf the FBI supplemental background report and a into a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nTo the summary released by the Republican committee majority FBI agents interviewed ten people in reached out to eleven focusing only on witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by cabinet and\nThe FBI provided to the Senate twelve detailed thrilled to reports summarizing their interviews with the witnesses as well as supporting materials selected by the witnesses during their interviews\nAmong those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser the three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Kavanaugh allegedly through were on the bed and sexually

you claim have first hand knowledge we're going with your claims you tell us right and they did know cooperation right for either ...\nOr or forward so interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary well\nWhat's interesting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering\nIn this process because the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details in those three oh two reports a secret and can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and ...\nAnd that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically I think in part works to the effect\nOf as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check the facts of the matter is you're not going to you're only going to interview people with first hand knowledge\nOr people that were said to have had first hand knowledge anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point being\nThe leftist screaming all day long on Thursday which was predictable and we said it was going to happen this is something that you know that that uh that this was a cover up that that's the words they were using it to cover up no it's not\nBecause Dr ... who's right now tell me\nWho won this scenario because if it's true it's hiding it from the Washington Post you say it's a cover up who's hiding evidence who's hiding evidence that they couldn't call the the New York times and the New York times would put it on the front page tomorrow\nTell me who\nIs being covered up Dr for his lawyers are Dr Ford in her lawyers are holding ... right that they claim cooperate her story right\nAnd it's not in the media already for video road log here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa

I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\n[noise]\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not about civil liberties that but I don't believe in the presumption a benefit but I just want to play a part of the interview that went back and forth because it gets to the point of being insane remember the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created to defend people's individual rights\nTo protect people that have been wrongly accused\nWill rights to protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused\nThe presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to adjust to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is that you ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU ... stood against during for instance the blacklist period he'll casualty and Brett Kavanaugh has nothing in common than you and your twin them in order to discredit capping off\nHow could you do that physiological you\nAppreciate your comments Tucker the common thread here courses powerful men whose careers were on the line issuing denial about sexual wrongdoing and in this instance can simply believe that the dial issued my wreck have it all goes right to integrity [noise]\nA position that he's applying for on ... on the Supreme Court and what she said some judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is the critical importance the most important they'll tell you know you have no doubt about that\nGood I I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity what Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes in court they wouldn't allow you to someone that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like new ones defended capital has not been so I'm telling them together\nIs by definition guilt by association and unfair do you think that the person your position Twenty years if it would have seen that\nThis isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job for ... I Know that's meant\nWhen I make the standard of proof Harris out a brand beyond a reasonable doubt why don't you put it in the next to Bill Cosby who has been tried in ... he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence view of the ... assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job of them so I'm not real but hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put them next to a man who was tried it in court and conviction of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because when they voted ... any of those things that individual also deny the accusations I think he would appreciate that we're criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the left to the right I care about the participants to make the country where they and they and what she wants to do that now you hear it on\nA sexual assault and to be taken very seriously here Tucker and I think that we're all in the crowding out the voices of women and believing that men and not believing women in this case this woman came forward and we're not sure how it was sort of circumstances here here's a sale on your the ACLU\nYou don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and leave it away from I Believe 'cause I think I Know more about your organization or a lot of the nation\nIt's an individualized determination about this woman who can't or die honestly the ... they can now you're that can reasonable mode so why would you say it's about women\nBeing heard when of course it's not about wasn't making one allegation against one man it's not an incident says there haven't been other men who denied accusations that we've said all are saying is that in this instance like in previous says women deserve an opportunity but if you heard about the hold on so when you were endorsing\nCollective judgment and collaborative John manning she had other women have nothing to do with that\nSort of the surrounding areas half an hour is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has not been honest and forthright Tucker I Believe is that how he come forward and said listen\nAll of us were yelling at some point in life we saw a thing now you're getting now you see me asking what okay well let me let me ask you have something like one of the time\nThe ACLU is the reason that the first amendment was defined in the clerics Brandenburg versus Ohio case of Nineteen sixty seven he was a ... and you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have the right to say what I think is true the it was now decided the rocket offend anybody they disagree with\nNo sir I think we have do we are defending right now they were low for defining what was the case do you want me to name another group it out how many times you have any comment with people on different ideological or the other group to\nMore than a shout out because you know I'm trying to think my principal the weather here in the middle of the memo from your group\nWe're not going to assist in cases it may advance and also white supremacist or other as soon as the themes are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are unpopular who disagree with why do you still exist we absolutely defend the people we are doing is that right around you look at the\nCase in New York\n\nI mean [laughter] so it was known it was done at that point [laughter] right well because they they do draw the line\nAnd they are political organization they learn to live there are no longer the ... and ... and and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't share the same value right hope that you've been you've blown it completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech\nBut again as we upset all along on this issue there had been so many\nOff shoot arguments that have nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute we judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted does not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her allegation that's it ...\nIt doesn't matter that other women had been\nA criminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed somebody else who was robbed does not have a greater morality or greater credibility to judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exists\nAnd that alone right that's what that's the only thing that you can go buy in the system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right\nBecause no other case counts no other criminal case counts no other victims opinions carry more credibility just because they're victims it is the evidence in every particular case that counts otherwise anyone can make the claim\nAnd if you were saying we believe the survivors and you'll be have like ...\n... or any organization or protester right now that it's chanting the same thing\nThen wait for it because at some point one of you will be falsely accused\n[noise] well you know when they say believe the survivor at that particular point mhm\nJust alone believe the you don't believe the survivor which means believe the person making the allegation right well actually believe that survivor actually means believe that people make believe the person making the allegation is if they're if they are in favor of the political issue the the the the actual\nA background political issue that we're really dealing here as long\nA background political issue that we're really dealing here as long as it's someone on our side that's making the accusation yes we all know that's what we all know is what it really means yet but just said believe the survivor means you believe the person making the allegation irrespective of any other evidence that exist right\nBecause you can't say believe the survivor and ended that no you can't you can't\nThat's on American to say that\nThat's an American that's not believing in the constitution it's not believing in individual rights it's everything that the ACLU used to stand for that now they reject completely and Tucker Carlson later on said he lost his temper temperature when he called them hacks well you didn't they are hatched\nThey are they're trying to be on their hands because they're trying to portray themselves as people that care about civil liberties when obviously they don't\nIt's all about politics to them look\nAt you and I have our ... our day to day politics that that we promote on the air but we also promote individual rights irrespective of our opinion on the issues of the day the individual rights and the constitution is still number one to watch yes it's not so the ACLU eight six six Ninety right I\nWas born with a radio with a record ...
