cooperate they will answer questions asked and in all likelihood give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis was something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different\nBecause you can compare forge testimony to her what she told the Washington Post the Washington Post things could change drastically\nBy the time she testifies and some things didn't change\nSo now what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI but\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet not Ramirez has not testified under oath she has been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony then that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants the White House reviews or that report which will come later this week\nAnd mark judge said he would fully cooperate right\nAh in in ... even though he did write another letter over the weekend mhm uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nOr after the Democratic party attempted to have cabinet rested on Saturday [laughter] merely officials reiterated their findings by their standards are worst charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors run record setting the evidence is insufficient\nTo merit a basis for even a search warrant\nMuch less than arrest which said that already before and that you couldn't even get a ... a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well\nWhat all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out as a lack of time and place and while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused in three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description right\nThe FBI or will also highlight greater amounts of evidence against Dr Ford her fear applying\nHer miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door but only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nA therapy notes will likely be required to be turned over ... why they were not turned over to the Senate Judiciary committee is inexplicable especially since she used that as cooperation upper first telling other missed a mysterious incident that's really interesting right as\nDr for its own family not one was capable of coming to work support ah why weren't\nThey the FBI may need to ask given that she was living with her parents at the time right there you go\n\nCould be Jeff Flake or anybody else but your ... this comes down to the votes of those people who were on the fence\nWell if they if they interview or mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview and anybody who's come forward that will likely by the way that that part of it\nWill likely that claim will likely take the longest\nThat likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case there's only so far you can go\nAnd it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the chapter on it\nBut I mean politically ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just one of the Democrats can't make that point\nNo they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but when they build what's allowed when someone like ... did what he did\nWill will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story too and got a little bit of publicity that ah the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll boosted friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn um um contest or no no no I'm In I'm In Missouri\nOh yeah well and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McKay if that's if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late or it could be\nPotentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation\nBy those senators who backed this the the you know the further investigation the FBI background check then I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed\nYou did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it and we know flake is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nFor the the other the other senators likely jumped on board or you know ... and by the way they ... they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine by the way\nFor what a two week better part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming at the investigation up the FBI investigation story from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest

Robert\nHi how are you guys doing real good thanks for calling\n[noise] I got a point but uh you asked how far this thing go after the interview everybody I think they should do is to see if there was any inappropriate behavior [laughter] think was a anyway\nWe understand your we understand your point [laughter] [noise]\nI mean really how those two cameramen getting in a U.S senator in that building that's what I Want to know [noise]\nWell I it's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you uh were following the procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out\nAnd then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so you had a ton of chaos five\nI'm with you but that's it's not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as secure as most people would think it is [noise] in that sense\nOf the Senate is it with that particular shattered [laughter]\nI Know that was the target yeah right right yeah that would be that right but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they will be looking here or\nI understand it does seem like you're you're the question in your mind is seems set up huh [laughter] I Would have to say yes that that that that the ... that flight set it up right [laughter] right oh I just did this or they they could in front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and that's where\nThe cameraman right yeah [noise]\nWhat do you know who I Am of all people are this whole ...\nAge age it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point\nAnd and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case\nBecause he has crossed the aisle so many times I think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming and also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum and while ultimately it didn't work [noise] uh in in in moving the process forward thanks to Jeff Flake it did\nIt did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general we'll see if that translates in November at election time but ah five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nWell so but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think it was all I think it was old school yeah you understand what the Senate's roller and you advise and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my or ... I'm sure that he had problems with Kagan and ... and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job to job isn't the job isn't to say\nAs a senator was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n\nAh no All right well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice right right but that was that was never the world to begin with it's are you confident the president gets to pick who he wants on the Supreme Court\nYou know I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham it just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that she did do it and he really was the perfect person to do that in that setting\nEight six six Ninety Retta\nJoin the

the day had reached an agreement\nWith the FCC saying and and then apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to happen and then by the end of the day they were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nUh this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take the company private and that he had access to funds\nOr he had done that some time ago and as a publicly traded company the chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true\nAnd that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was at a was a secured at that have been promised to him a any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private\nThat started this whole thing into okay\nAnd then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the company\nBut this especially because you're manipulating the stock price or the company uh it had a jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true\nMight have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drop the stock up because he would have to buy out all of that existing stock then it came out\nOn friday which was interesting actually late or Thursday and friday morning the investigation showed that because he came up with the price of\nFour hundred and twenty dollars per share\nAnd according to investigators\nHe actually used for twenty four reason that everybody suspected on the Internet he was trying to impress his girlfriend according to investigators with the four twenty price and of course it's relation to pot and he was also seen smoking pot on a pod cast\nA and you add all that

I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control over\nI I say what you mean yeah the the lip service that's where the ... the attack it ... it lip service and I think that they'll continue to attack and that's\nWhat that's but that that's the norm they call that Tuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when they were to say Supreme Court decision I don't like that when he lied on their door to give song in on something funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking to her the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself from any case involving if he ceded any case involving a democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the\n[laughter] well in that case I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or or or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person\nIn the case [laughter]\nYou should ... lives yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defendant your game you're not a person making the point you have no standing or want to be interesting Congress ... played one of the interesting conversations that got\nI got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty what does it it'd be three fifty four genders uh the the that are out there and then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of\nWhy don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video robot here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of a mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana north and South Dakota\nSo if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit is going to be in the form a brain clear today in the northeast and Midwest\nThere's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety ...\nWhen I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor he would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\n... because they if they believe in this ... approach it has never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left they\nDon't hail Joe Manchin is somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not\nGetting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was settler after he ran for president right and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nThat I Do very good [noise] I say more bloody and brought in the gay shit I sort of like to find out a little more about this stock the science school college so heard have that oh you\nMean expand the investigation on her\nThat show us that about her dishes so hey this is just buddies just as bad as just shoot it gets it didn't hit nothing about that when they hear nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on Ford we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about forward but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm Mm\nWell if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check so the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far\nMight not be what the FBI limits themselves too and and discussing it with Ford or according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she still not yet been interviewed well my question is\nYou're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kevin ... then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony\nYou're likely going to go and and interview maybe even family members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims so there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process\nAnd that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorney scholar the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Yale who said no he he drank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes\nWell how can you quantify it and how can you prove you know and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically this\nThis old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself on the amount that you drank 'cause you know 'cause I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk and your judgment other compared to somebody else's judgment\nThirty five years ago that would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that's not ... not going to have it now\nAnd they'll they'll see them they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was\nBy that person to claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time a color hair and I think first aid from Daytona Beach but uh
