Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and and and the results of the work\nOf this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to ... um\nMentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right ah I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA ... whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called\nCollins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon\nSpeech\nYeah and and except for ... ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech and like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that\nWe got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nBrett Kavanaugh um you know you can only fight so much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican is party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is as many when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they'd been in a while\nA more constitutional and they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party\nAs I said last week\nLike I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going that perceptions as he still goes after them as he did others\nEarly on made you think OK doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know well what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham touch still be on the Sunday Morning news show saying he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right ... you know and that's it because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending\nTo change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably a ways from that because\nThat goes back to again what we said the base of the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and in the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks there's just not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they\nStart with well we need to do away with the Senate and we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with\nTo do away with the Senate and we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with the uh get well in a way with the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't be for that do that it's not going to have you know it's not the right now but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because if they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance\nOf of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process\nConstitutional issues not defending somebody when you talked about those are all hugely moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win and twenty twenty again state\nYeah [noise] ... or a book or right by the way

A. V. E.\n[noise]\n\nAnd running radio he is are coming on Gary McNamara a chick six Ninety red eye\nComing up on the bottom of the hour we'll hear more from Lindsey Graham ah who made his rounds on the Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday and we'll hear from him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witnesses back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nOf women who made allegations against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go through the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to state yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it ... there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it\nAnd if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and get people uh motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get Republicans out or is this ... because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand up of of an instance but you know where it was something will come along\nAnd once that happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity remember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party was split\nAnd and I don't believe this is just about capital I think it is about the fact that you have the as I've said why'd I\nThink it will Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans are identified themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that\nShows you how wide the Republican Party is uh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ...\nThey're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world logs here's your forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrived by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some impact as well that would be the Gulf side or western side of a state system expected to track right on up through southern Georgia\nThe outer banks of South Carolina and North Carolina as well throughout the latter part of the week heavy rain north and south of the line from just west of by thirty five today snow for the upper reaches of Northern Rockies\nThere's your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist\nJohn ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not legitimize McCarthyism dang good and I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off\nWell you know the thing is is that um I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the\nUh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through a on an important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president\nBut uh you know making some very solid points\nUh the ... was going to you know they used to him when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president\nLeft wanted to use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but\nOf course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and breeding Frank Bernie's column and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there it's it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems that really doesn't get\nWhat we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a bully doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger are much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by the Democrats\nAnd and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee Frank\nBruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing while he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said as we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward\nSingle point that we had made\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit\nAnd the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and rice and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying\nTo\nThem I mean it is again a the ... they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you cannot the debate so they have to step out of ... ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what\nWell he used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world\nAbsolute loyalty is expected\nAs we've set in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this real people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nOh I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you're running for attorney general right [laughter] do you want to eat or to general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough we\nWe've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple to arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't [noise]\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read Bernie is calling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing from spot to become attorney general yeah you have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect [laughter] that'll tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nBand and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with what I was home for six weeks and months he wrote a
