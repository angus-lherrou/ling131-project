number one goal to go to John in Minnesota John welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nThanks for taking my call say um I just like to take exception to cheer premise of belief that\nPresident Trump's going to have a long term effect accomplish 'cause you know I mean it can be over to X number one you know he's got three branches or the ... all three branches of government\nI'm a God or your first by presidents come and do\nA a okay I'll I'll tell you what ... we're short on time John I'll tell you what the and the river are still have a tune construction is on the Supreme Court good point yeah excellent\nPoint yeah I I that's why I don't remember us in any segment today saying what you claim we stayed it\nOr leave it did about maybe forty five minutes ago that you know this kind of revolution and you know they got all the all the answers\nAnd I'll make you know John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress and they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nYeah and I made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could get you on that because I pointed out uh with you know capital and Gorsuch you have to construction yeah you're right on the knowledge that right and and when we want we ... we were the ... we were the\nFirst to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most about Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you use executive orders from uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah it's not going to be long term\nBut the tax cuts could be long term well ... and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember I'd almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent what ... what was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated because the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last administrators and tried they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges\nAnd business but the state we just we didn't make that statement today that what President what President Trump did a has done we'll be long lasting parts of it will\nSome everything he does will not because presidents are limited in their power and we've often stated that button and I think you would the perfect answer a the the the fact of two Supreme Court justices construction as is huge and that is long last ... talking it'll be longer generation and there possibly be a third of ... or third and fourth if he's\nEver reelected right right so you know it it that's\nWhat it comes down to and and just be careful about putting words in our mouth we didn't say anything to work to zing us let's say [noise]\n\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight fear in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh\nThat's not what the sentence Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the there was harm you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence in Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone out and would have gone on\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go out and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask\nThe right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we uh when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat\nThey're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the facts they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons\nWho nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against divisiveness and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and like specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know the trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces that we've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... or group of people based on the which area which again that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\n[noise] yeah if you look at the nature of or how this was sent a the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level of don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do show the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources in ... in in finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from what I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bombs or not they know right they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by and that was a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\n\nWell because in in in and I know is is there a reason that I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigative reason why you\nWouldn't do it well and if they\nWere armed or or or if they were at\nThat at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nA right there in the building the CNN building a ... those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days you know because if\nThey were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents to a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level of security ah but if it's if you're talking about you know the meeting\nThe security ah but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real ... that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety right I\nWas reminded of Ira and regardless it's radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shovel tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shut will tell us what matters is inside\nReserve and at first stop centers almost half\nOf all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking it's easy to send hard earned dollars in time can feel searching for that elusive spot and the stress a safe place to park says or something you should have to worry about reserve it can help reservists foster the smart asked for a long list serve it parking peace of mind at ... senators\nNow pay for parking with Belgium one point in the open when we're when\nI'm home alone for eighty years Detroit Diesel has been the legendary driving forces many of the best known for us on the road to our latest Detroit technology Tony ... says he earned a reputation of being a total loser solution\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one ... to ...

to never drove through this community college righto drove through what the signs were out front on them you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting in the political signs all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were ...\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college ah yeah yeah which\nAnd I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a court house right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles and I was going to go there and I said nah I Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been on it before so\nHad about a thousand foot ... pouring rain\nBut when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I walked into a polling

stock market took a hit yesterday was a ... of the day\nYeah yeah yeah down or over six hundred points\nSo a ... you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but\nYou or the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go and get what are you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return\nOr some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material cost especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... and but I don't remember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming lend until NAFTA is actually signed right or whatever it is the new now than they do now and we're not calling now [laughter] right\nUh but as far as I and

rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you and I are totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow isn't labor is material I'd never seen a

along coastal Washington and Oregon your national forecast red eye radio a meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nWhat do you support we know you don't\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the parties should have been braced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we upset that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before on\nOn the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last\nThirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy ... which was the amnesty that was two thousand five just it they they made the decision just a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat what their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding\nEvery ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue than the challenge and that's what it was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't ... they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here and\nWant to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought to your attention the demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country\nAre blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote\nDemocrat mhm no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically\nBut the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you do with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force him and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp but you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes by\nThe way he's also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here\nRight do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other\nThings that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent\nYes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that now That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are\nAbout to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the boats most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who and I mean the ...\nTell me who and I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two may be clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination of bodies they\nWon't even have the debate right right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will ... is the question eight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book [noise] we're born with
