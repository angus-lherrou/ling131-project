morning and we uh we appreciate it as we're less than two weeks out from the the the mid term election I think this is going to be\nA a another fascinating time in in our history to see where this uh uh goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we look at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look at you you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we spend his time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely awful they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is a wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America fields but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIt if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where\nUh I I call it a a\nTrump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just point that weren't just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to ... I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat ... that I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either owned their companies are in management up or you know a high management and the companies that the rent or own their own companies or or\nHi management and the companies that the rent or own their own companies are or are in sales and I started talking about them during the whole me to\nThing about you know how they how they felt about it and I use them as examples of women that I Know that how they looked at the whole cabinet situation\nWhere you know they defended cabin on they didn't believe that the woman was always right they of course bleeds and due process and a presumption of innocence and they believe in the rights that are you know under the constitution and they are conservative\nAnd [laughter] you would look and you would say a egg extremely uh you know aggressive and positive in business and in life\nAnd and so I just thought to bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and both probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I'm guessing I'm not sure but probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right why why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base\nRight and so there you go but uh\nWe get to your calls in common is

I mean we've seen them he's a liar\nUm he's a he's the end and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include ... in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go out for them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that\nYou know does work because it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names\nYou call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat if you go you go to you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh ... you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I like people say well what do you mean that's a that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nEvan then he lost a lawsuit against you or I Would say is that was a privilege lawsuit and he's been doing this and look what he tried to do to destroy cabin all men at that point you get the political when\n... right there is a social media when for young people is that what you're looking for you're talking about again likely voter groups and those who are right now on the fence it if it's not a positive don't don't do it don't say it and there are\nPlenty of positives that he can say you're wasting your time [noise] dealt with anything else I mean [noise] jobs the economy by those things would resonate with young people whether it's going to get them to vote or not that's that's a you know we don't know but it certainly is a positive [noise]\nAh other affect the presidents of the past\nYou know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this current economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally is a a ton of positives and this Matt this massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not\nThat you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer writing buddy ... because I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the\nPurest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising that's ridiculous I of course you have to point out on nothing that you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran to write that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs all solved cry you know not right right well that that that it then that's why I started ... I started laughing because\nYou know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to get blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the cabinet hearing said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were both Democrats are trying to we used a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not a quarter or it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms criminal court has\nWhen you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation is at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate way as you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out that\nPeople say well you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody but not a patriot because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate and\nYou wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people's about just shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech ... no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nRight that free speech oh\nNo no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country ...\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the way in the\n... move onto the next when well again I Want\nTo win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it\nAnd then went back to and and the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar Lanny I now I made that one up I don't know I'm not I'm not thinking these are the ones I I don't want to get a ...\nWas a ... what was it I don't know when you when you when you start when they said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah and I bought a used somebody's got those listed somewhere over ... ... no ... we said\nThis though well now it's poodle people in office it's running it's beautiful ... is that line to any more [laughter]\n\nThan as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father that involved in the U.S [laughter] ...\n[laughter] as far as we know [laughter] but but but look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd an end the name of of of publicity on one side and we were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant I mean that's something that works brilliant as a big word but that's something that's ... it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes because it's real simple it's\nBrilliant political moment yes because it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making\nYou know it's not about one man

Bush was called Nazi the only thing is the difference between a Bush and they Donald Trump is pushed never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase ... but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're\nFrom ... rubber the protests started his ranch in Texas\nYeah in central Texas ... it was everything\nThey were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was\nA ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know we are we called them Hitler but they really weren't but ... and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is whether that's a\nWonderful wonderful Republican actually named Hitler runs one day we're like oh I didn't\n[laughter]\nI I'm trying to think if there is is there a politician in American aimed Hitler\nI'm I'm guessing if that's your name you you might want to change it and most have but um but this is the he's the tactic and yes from the left that's the tactic and if you engage they're going to engage even further and we see that that that's\nVery evident now I'm with this current brought it but as we said with with Trump Trump visited them with what he's actually done and it's interesting because I had a discussion last week with a friend that I've known for Thirty years now\nAnd she claims that she's a liberal whenever I talk to her I find that she agrees much more with me that that it surprises me when we what we only see each other once every couple of years we sat down we had to talk and when actually you know\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people\nOver Kavanaugh that to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is\nOr what I suspect it couldn't be\nIt actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not their own ... right\nRight yeah um and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know ... ... if that's affecting enough voters in the Midwest\nOr just to turn some of those districts ah or to just keep people at home I don't even know that it will you know change your vote from right to laugh at the people but if you stay home that's enough to handle after wet\nEight six six Ninety right I\nWas

I was out here I was\nSo low I remember going you know we saw that and uh and I was so low dose and so the ... the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about an hour almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance of it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there's a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it but but\nIt's been over Thirteen Years but this has been a huge issue ... huge issue is that certainly would kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed\nAs a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold\nAs as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you\nWill uphold right that's a fair question to ask are you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\n\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform or border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise or we don't know what they want\nRight and do it\nCan get it on eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nSix months he wrote or on the radio [noise]\n[noise] right now is he a and Petro stopping centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme C Cushing is on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven\nYou been forced to make some tough choices over the past few years do you want greater fuel efficiency in profitability or a tough truck you can count on\nWith a western ... forty seven hundred you don't have to compromise you can get your tough back with the combination of incredible efficiency durable components improved up time and rub your dependability that western stars known for\nSo stop settling for something less than you want or need find your nearest dealer at western star dot com and see how you can get George tough back\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro quarter and Ninety Days plant dynamite\nEverything we tried sail except to\nPick up two bottles of super make a fish oil get the third bottom free Patrick to make a three day ha and eat PA fatty acids super make is great for your dogs immune system healthy skin and suck shiny for dogs love it try super ... by to get one free at dynamite dot com", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "24"}
