run I run a a welcome to the show\nI I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said\nIncluding perhaps at a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing about it's about our country being able to get everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why now\nRight here in this country and the good thing about that which is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be Newt and retail doors shutting raft and write a if the opposite for job he would go in a massive recession\nIf we had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof\nIt's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology for the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get\nFrom from other countries but say we even had those rare metals do produce everything here\nMeans number one you're not going to buy anything from anybody else which means they're not going to buy anything from you which means us producers only have a market of three hundred and twenty million people are three hundred and thirty whatever it is down instead of seven billion people the farmers would\nBe if they ... they would be done [noise] yeah they they feed the world we as a nation and feed the world\n[noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason icon is supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mind went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all the it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there\nWhat they'll win and we stated we stayed with China and the intellectual property yet we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle and already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the tariffs worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only\nIncreases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm uh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nAnd because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods to you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite\nOf the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean you if you if you say\nIt's a very populist viewpoint right we need to help the farmers\nBut when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world um\nYou know and and they're traveling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the because forget about the political part president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's ... I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\nWell in terms of of getting things die as you said it was it like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that show and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the ah\nThe supportive above a lot of people and other than I Know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well what was dissolved ago she Asian\nWell wait he was a master negotiate or what is the need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ... the grocery shopping done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know ... and again him or we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know it and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy ... but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did allow what what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas that worth the loss of business\nWith the tariffs that the president has put on that\nDoes raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials and other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some ah some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it I think it was a Wall Street journal so it must and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other than the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up as to his caps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other tariffs hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the other states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... were humor in that category emerging the cap well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two countries in Canada Mexico aren't reaching they gave him enough buffer space so it's actually not going to affect that it's more well it is symbolism over the substance said okay we're going to produce them here and not over there\nSo when you actually look at the specifics of what is in after what the new NAFTA what did you actually gain specifically you know just no one is talking about that the only thing they brought up was what they did on automobiles and the one percent increase in the market share of Canada now eight six

they you know have they looked at the president and said\nLook Republicans ... they they look and they just say we're voting against the party of the president if it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's it uh there are I think right now if you look at the the\nFarming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration\nOn you know giving the money is saying they would rather have the business or that shows\nThat they believe this could be

describe the snow area as being between I Seventy to the north I forty to the south\nI thirty five to the east and a twenty five in the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota into the upper Great Lakes mainly rain just south of Detroit\nFor areas of the coast will be dry today the east coast high pressure

red eye [noise]\n\nEnd and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two already too yes\nBy would love to see which district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecideds\nMore and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital\nAnd that entire thing and really me and my look at the our CPA for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done now you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and so but most of my point is so yeah it is the legitimacy of the our CPA average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\n[noise] I guess historically can shift happened ah with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race\nOr the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider it's not a toss up that's my point my point is it's our sleepy has it has definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map but still showing great it's just when gray\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just Web grey eye of thanks to the staff at our CPA for listening to read I read it was it for them aware of what happened just when it just went and gray yeah\nAll right I'm I'm I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and what I had was from a week ago or something but it's just one great sense now I tiny brain ask myself I've got no wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and they'll look at the end when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden updates Edwards gray in front of me yeah\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nAir Arizona was like blue was flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because of mix Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great and\nThat because Mick Sally there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from All right I'm going to al Marri Sienna uh um Santa and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nIt is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a ...\nIt's a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the RC piece Senate map and the one next week is the Senate note toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught subset of that is what I was okay that's what I was I ... I Know that is if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it makes sense now yep 'cause that was like wait a how can you call\nA can't Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way that the wrong map out the\nThe New York times CNN poll this life pull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now ah on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread ascendant and his volunteers right furious the fact that he said he would have endorsed cabinet and\nWell something's happening there yeah I mean you see in the CNN poll going back to a a between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and Brad Olson was up five but all these the polls the recent polls\nAre from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times poll\nA ten eight to ten eleven uh the New York times she had to pull for teen point lead\nFor the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nNuts massive ... in a month that as a Nineteen point swing yeah that's huge deficit is huge\nAre causing comments coming up eight six six nine to eat right I\nWant to do for your goals the six six Ninety row Paul wrote on the radio [noise]\n\n\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you by freight line or trucks cobra electronics\nHe's proud to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink in travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives from Russian ovarian cancer by empowering women to leave proactively for every radio snowman who was making a donation to think in the fight against cancer the right to see the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nTruckers quick question for you how do you stay entertained or the end of a long drive\nMe I like to unwind at the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab with ... satellite antennas it's easier than ever check it out a dish for my truck dot com and get all the TV you love to watch at home when the time for another ... west coast to coast service is\nPerfect for fleets to offer more info visited just for my truck dot com restrictions apply\nRed eye radio in our sponsors a devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting drivers who surpass the million mile mark with preventable accident free driving\nBy reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more of driving without a preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's right I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... the family of companies motel six the St Christopher fond\nCats scale and cover electronics we applied the individual truckers and fleets who drive with care and keep our highways if you're driving right now and you'd like to read the informative an entertaining content found in the current September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you will listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of O.
