about the American political landscape it's not\nIt's about somebody who has evil in their heart that wants to take the lives of others we're not talking about someone who is uh just shouting at

going to bring politics into it you've got you cannot without being biased and and this is where\n\nOr when we look at the media we say you want to see the bias there it is right there how come they're not asking a former President Obama\n\nShould stay away from Pittsburgh\nWhy isn't that being said\nWell because he look listen to the description\nOr just real simple from ... was fair con

people who believe\nThat overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis without hesitation yeah I'll expand on that it's amazing how people who believe that overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis and ISIS without hesitation yeah\n\nThinking about it but the ones that that are trying to make that point are the ones without the most out writing just accusations against their opponents the ultimate being that an incoming president\nColluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election mhm and they pounded that year in and year out you know it's ah when when you look at it and we just to you know talked about you know the whole lock her up thing with Hillary Clinton and how the Democrats have jumped on that same see how in civil he is this is how radical they are they're saying lock her up lock her\n... and we'd just explain why\nBut we read earlier the to\nHave the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increase wages and getting rid of government corruption ... white admitted they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of what is the the the biggest ally looked into the living room\nOf government corruption many people believe it's that Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it\nIt's ... it's the entire Russian collusion as we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... go you know a a as in their own words\nAre committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack the election that it was changed the outcome of the election and what we learned in that time in that time we ... we have learned it is the opposite\nThat it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an opposition research firm which funneled that money to a former British spy who got on verified information that he claims\nOn verified still to this day on true I think it's safe now since there's never been any evidence in uh over two and a half years of investigation a ... of it false information from people close to the Kremlin\nThat Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they use to try they wanted to destroy his campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen they also took that information\nAnd used it to get a secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you want corrupt possible corruption that's corruption\nYeah as absolute that's how how do you debate something like that how do you debate those facts when it's documented for radio row dog here's your forecast\nMultiple periods of rain and

but she thinks it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs\nThat's good news for Republicans face you know election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports\nYou said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash ricin reports national television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three per cent store right his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic uh a performance\nGood or excellent marks for months ago when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty\nSeven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor but the ... out here just six percent rake national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're as long as we're not in a war you know new a new war people don't care\nRight or the let me see uh a survey this is what does this here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a high up fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on\nThe Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans sing Trump is doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the G O P boaters give positive remarks to the president and his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a\nPoor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with\nEither major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is that a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending an update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw a Rasmussen uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent\nBlack voter approval at record high well so we're talking about the economic and inform but\nThey say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record high\nYeah well and and I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question\nAs it is with every election what is what is one of the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about\nI mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about\nIt because there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but\nThey're still never truckers there's still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right so there's that\nThat part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be\nThe end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nAh they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nYou know one thing I just wanted to bring up here 'cause we're you know talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or\nWhatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news endorsed a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news and the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support bait or work number Ted Cruz no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not\nShe's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the vote for him I could talk ... former conservative\nColumnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute [laughter]\nYeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of a him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... which is like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald or I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservatism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you couldn't possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all year not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show and we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve ... Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today I'd be happy\nYou know if Trump would Donald Trump was done today\nI'd be happy I was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me ... would you please um [laughter] but imagine that you know there were a number of things and imagine even that the economy ... weren't growing as as fast\nOr a ... and they weren't happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't\nIt's not the we never share the endgame you and I are the rates is never finished because there are so many things to do but it's what we're looking at right now\nGorsuch Ann Cavanaugh\nI I can I can sleep go back I can sleep at night while I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep but I'll go back to march or twenty sixteen them a depression that existed\nMhm yep\nWell and think about where it might have gone where it might have gone on the bench\nYep that's what I mean ... ...
