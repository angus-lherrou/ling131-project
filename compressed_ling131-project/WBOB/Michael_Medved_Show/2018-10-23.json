bit of a civil war going on there with the NFL kneeling out of ... of\nThe other day what a what would happen yeah it was like a it's like wow okay calling somebody had midfielder Neal colonialist wow it was like wow um\nWell you know we set at ... why not just have a ... game separate they they could have a three hours of protests and kneeling and then they have three hours of football but um\nThere it is to National Football league stars on opposing teams had to be separated before game on Sunday over the long simmering tensions related to the national anthem protests as column

which team receives the ball to start\nThe uh the the game a when a bad to happen\nApparently than the Eric read um you know a a approach\nMug Malcolm Jenkins label him a subtle sellout and then Neal colonialist for not kneeling apparently Jenkins as part of the group that the decided okay if the NFL gives us money we won't meal anymore mhm\nAnd so Eric re doesn't like that so we called him a needle colonialist now you notice that nobody on the Buffalo Bills has been called a Neal colonialist why is that because the bills don't attempt and don't get into anybody else's territory\nThere never able to augment ... anybody else's territory that's very true on the field so you'd be if you can't look at the Buffalo Bills going with their own Jared yeah yeah yeah look during the colonial is yeah in fact the opposite they're anti Neal colonial's because when they're on our fencing keeping push back\nBackwards they're not gaining any territory they're being pushed further back yes\nIn

blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes that we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nGraduates happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL we've been saying for years here not unexpected\nNo because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing would you nearly with the with the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow I mean that's what's

was just thinking what we were talking about\nYou know how the the expanding victim and oppressor base of All right the Democratic party right now we're ... we're using the example of the transgender movement against feminist mhm were feminist now and we've set feminism is dead if any man can be a woman whenever they wish to be a woman for sure I mean\nIf you look at the ... in fact the ah the civil rights act is is gone if anyone anyone simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected groups\nRight and we saw this with the whole bit war in a while [laughter] messier eventually [laughter] mathematics lesson for last week well [laughter] it's also strategy less on what not to do but it\nBut they don't get it they still come up with these think this is this was a tactic used politically where they actually had I guarantee you a meeting on this yet that's yes that's the thing that\nGets to watch yeah somebody had a meeting on this okay what should we do I know I get the blood test and I know but the DNA nobody's stood up and said dumb idea yeah right yeah we can't do that [noise]\nWhy not [noise]\nBecause they don't [noise] okay we're going to do it [noise]\n... you know what I'll break it down to two words oh Casio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared\nTo her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in a life really has complained about money in politics right since Hillary so it was funny 'cause I saw that on social media somebody said settled Trump won because of the money in and said you know\nHillary raise more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right ooh a look at look at a a look Democrats don't complain about money in politics them if they're raising the money that you see that in the exact no nobody's complaining about not I have not heard one Democrat\nCome out and say it's just wrong in that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising\nUnprecedented money pursue it right now in\nFact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea that fond of it was a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain ... but you know that was McCain fined gold and and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that couldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of of an election I Believe ... six is within an election\nBecause it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you run ads is to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand how\nThe country was formed do they understand about the partition of government for redress of grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this back going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen and ... maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major tenants of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right and now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the who wants it came out said that the presidency was adequate yeah that was a\nFew weeks ago was that that was like a more\nWhat is it Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially to the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency altogether\nRight and so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media well it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nA Senate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not\nHave you seen the polls a majority of Americans can't\nTell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know right according to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast majority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works\nWhich I then we have stated we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate should be gone if you believe that the electoral college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed\nThat it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy it was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's as long as they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about them\nOr they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and but when you get down to it it's a clear under a not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote so beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because cabin all went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservatives or never Trump hers come ... most of them [laughter] not all most of them are are come aboard at that time and that's why we've seen I I Believe in more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at something that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house ... are also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance\nTo get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand but if you can have a construction is court and you can have\nOf not only a five to four but it's six to three ... that that could move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that's extremely important ... the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's what's interesting too is that you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the caravan and likely won't reach the border before an election day two weeks from today that the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and\nWe've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and the because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest\nAll those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need ... view that that was their first protest well then it became about Dr Ford\nBut we said after he's confirmed whatever happens and you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on a Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday it they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it it but there is there is at the point being there is a new protest and new hot button a almost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you ... I guess this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory\nAnd if you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for\nIt is working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall he needs the house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house\nRight and and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nUh I saw the other day that after uh the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours right well at that and and blisters and they were going to rest for a while well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month\nRight so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going at as to you know who were supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating far right wing\nWebsite stating that it's you know several sponsors groups you have a Wall Street journal studying you know basically they're not sure they talk about the leftist politician an ... an organized system started it and then they were surprised how quickly or the number of people got aboard they talk about the people without frontiers\nThe U.S Mexico a group that as an got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really sure here at this\nParticular moment yeah a lot of these groups have funding in the past\nFrom folks on the left including Charles but whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it all coming up plus your calls and comments eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBucks more ready to do with a record ...

from\nSan Antonio dot com divided Democrats struggled to answer Trump's claims on my grand caravan Democrats are struggling to respond\nTo president Donald Trump but as Republican allies were cast in the care of on a of thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border as a failure of Democrats to help an act immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress dumped some Democrats said Trump is vulnerable to counterattack on his court campaign issues\nGiven that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates had been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump\nOn this particular issue that's why we said this was a loser from the start where people were saying you know what their hope is a you know before\nOr election day that these thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence it will be going on and it will hurt the Trump in a war hurt the Republicans well that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before him he said well maybe\nMaybe sorrow will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet and drop a hunger at night you know in order to win and able are claiming while that's going to be the next thing they're gonna be driving cars whatever look the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time yeah that's good or if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news\nNo well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken that can be violence simply the border patrol can handle that kind of thing right and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but\nIt's if the ten thousand all arrived at a particular time\nThat we're a energized and well fed and old decided to run across the border at one particular time well and\nThat's that said look if you just go back to the planning of of of such an event ride or just say you're a liberal a backer or Soros or whoever and you're going to fund this and you're going to the you know organize all this um what do you expect that is going

Republicans\nAre in most states are that they have a survey to seven of those states with a close Senate races they bring the Republicans right now one of the reasons why you know what the one issue

temper and October ... as they now refer to what Trump care mhm\nThat's the one thing that they believe that's the one thing in the polls that the Republicans are way behind that the people believe that the Democrats will do a better job they do not allow the Republicans on healthcare yeah as we said would happen\nYou saw Schumer was a it was a a few weeks ago or what it was actually it was

eight six six Ninety red eyes [noise]\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time a day who the day shift so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the ship and I remember I just said I'm going to you know I I couldn't\nWas trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home when I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again\nTells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired and you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that and people that know me and to know me and my whole life said\nYou really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my entire mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter ... anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in awhile and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nAre as a sleep therapist who who uh\nSaid when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist 'cause he was also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it can't manage to go to sleep like seven o'clock there is no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours and back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it and he said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost set I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it literally is a a round the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this\nAh and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to to this yeah but yeah it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I Can't yeah yeah well I Do not my mind and point I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and uh up until a almost one PM on Monday\nA afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon I got up\nAt six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes\nAh see I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate would sleep your brain still works my brain does not work them the same at all if I if if I don't sleep correctly it just so tough for me to to to do that so I guess it's\nSlow and for the August ... same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because\nHad I during that time I mean you know where the where the big a family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up a venue and and uh and and clearing everything out\nA loading out a but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding [laughter] that that show [laughter]\nAnd you know what I mean cause you and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did I take some home and I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew that wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems\nBut you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me and it differs with people I Know people that can like drink coffee\nYou know full strength coffee and have no issues\nUm it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee\nAnd he talks about him he's they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups if I had two or three cups of coffee and today well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I'm the diets got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep I'm going to have to really mind my piece infusing and lots of water\nOr\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there um and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly but\nTypically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference if it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYou or mentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there's hours of service that regulate the drivers and\nAnd a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back of the Fifteen Years and and I'm Glad that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and you know they all go through the ... they all have their their hours of service\nYou know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig\nAnd I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right\nA or a\nPeople tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night um or or stay up all night and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's it's\nPerfectly normal I don't see how people work on the rotating shifts my my dog ran my best friend's father was a cop yeah\nYeah but most of his career yeah he would work six weeks for shit yes then six weeks second ... life than six weeks third shift said that I don't know ... pot I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down now you've got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nOr whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined and you know it's a habit that I I don't know if\nThey still do that is in law enforcement and to me that ... that are well that would be an an alert is concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well you've got you've got to change sleep\nJust like yeah I that it'd be a ... total concerned yeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they it's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he was talking to me about it recently he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well dad it's easier than what you described a back into your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he Rosen rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nYou know I think I Can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah I get up at like five in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I pick it up so I'm tired by the time Sunday night comes around and go to sleep and one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights I lift weight in the Sunday I can not my\n... one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights I lift weight in the Sunday I cannot my muscles are too much stimulation just yet just on it that's the one thing I
