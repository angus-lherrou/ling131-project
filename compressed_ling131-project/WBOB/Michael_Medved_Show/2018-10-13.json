Bush or anybody else that came together in most dead on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham I was just going to\nI was just going to ... um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because they hate Trump right ah I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight\nTo defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for ... ... ... ... ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech and like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass\nAnd the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending\nThe great Trump pick\nBrett Kavanaugh um you know you can only fight\nSo much within your own party ... before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nA ... ah get done as a Republican or Republican is party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is dismayed when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fights or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others early on we\nReally know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh wasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him\nAnd I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know well what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning new show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah right\n... you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right on issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and\nMean great things long term for this country I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process of the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state because it gives them the seat\nUltimately on other and the vote\nOn other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of building building the wall really\nIf you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why\nStart with well we need to do away with the Senate and we predicted this\nI start with well we need to do away with the Senate and we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with the uh get well in a way where the electoral dollar the Democratic senators won't be for that do that it's not going to have you know it's nothing but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because if they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that mode happens to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all hugely moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they're able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully get Trump the chance to win in twenty twenty against state\nYeah ... ... or a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they

made his rounds on the Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday some we'll hear\nFrom him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witnesses back again and everything else that would be interesting from what does this especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to state yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it ... there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it\nAnd if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and get people uh motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get route Republicans out\nOr is this ... because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand up\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once that happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity\nRemember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was wet\nAnd and I don't believe this is just about capital I think it is about the fact that you have\nThe as I've said why'd I Would think of Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democrat Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to a you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about a mainstream leadership those on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ...\nThey're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S\nWe are looking at again today for clear skies in the region the Florida Panhandle the big band in fact ah the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nHas now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west especially southern Illinois and southern Indiana along the Ohio River\nBend as you move into Ohio we get a little break but then in northern Ohio around Cleveland up through eerie PA and portions of northern Pennsylvania into upstate New York a chance of some slight showers today\nTropical storm Sergio will bring some showers two portions of New Mexico and parts of western Texas today when I asked you know forecast red eye radio meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six

made you upset because I Would not legitimize McCarthyism than good\nAnd I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell\nKnow the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the\nAnother thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the\nFrom ah the ah the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of her nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president\nBut uh you know making some very solid points\nUh the ... was going to you know they used to him when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right\nLindsey Graham and the you know since Trump is when president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the bipartisan willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernie's column and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and I thought he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking from side with Trump's candidate I mean it seems that really\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a bully doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from a Lindsey Graham but\nLindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday it was based on the lack of merits of the case\nThe ... and on the larger a much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment\nOf Kavanaugh by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing\nTo the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said as we discussed as for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have any one I have not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed\nAt all except for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case\nWith this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we had made\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drive the nuts and moral and correct and rice and you're wrong\nAnd reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple tend Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying to\n\nThem I mean it is again a the they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you cannot the debate so they can't step out of his ... Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what\nWell he used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this older right over there that's a good nominate that's that's a good nomination pick over there\nI like that I don't like this real people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nOh I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and John might in the future you're running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what do you want to eat or to general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple ten arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read very is telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah you know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nThat it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect\n[laughter] that'll tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump\n\nDebate him on the points made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with what I told them for six weeks and months he wrote a [noise]\nJoin the conversation using this\n\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nBoom boom boom boom for eighty years Dr diesel has been the legendary driving force inside many of the best known for us on the road to our latest Detroit technology Tony ... says he's earned a reputation of\nBeing a total of is a solution dedicated to moving up time and our customers bottom line\nWe're committed to continuing a legacy for another eight years and beyond what he demanded also demand Detroit\nYears of innovation dedication and recognition\nA great products it's there's a\nGreat look ... introducing new logo on their new labels houses more than just their diesel free to anti jail they have a\nFull family of ... products from house meaner power cleaner of the top of the line diesel injector cleaner and liberate us to house multi purpose liberator and penetrating oil an alcohol free products with over one thousand one uses so much for the new logo and all the great house products on the market how's lubricate or a\nFamily company with a family of products that you can trust\nThat you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "13"}
