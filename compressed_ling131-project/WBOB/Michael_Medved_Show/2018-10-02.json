half Harris survey this is from uh the daily one are done by the Harvard campus Harris survey\nAh found that when people are told that the three name witnesses do not cooperate the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford opinions ship decisively in Kavanaugh's favor\n\nOr as a\nThey reported on Monday polls by you God and Reuters found that people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party\nMore than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not overall you guys have found that forty one percent believe for thirty five percent believe\nKavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent belief for\nThirty one percent believed Kavanaugh Harris Poll chairman Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton pollster reported Sunday\nThat the Harris Poll found that forty percent who saw read parts of the testimonies last Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible wall twenty three percent alone said capital seem credible alone a total of twenty seven percent said that both seem believable\nOr does sixty seven percent total belt but for was credible fifty percent felt the cabinet was credible\nWere the Harris Poll study gets really interesting is in its findings on the\nAnd I was credible were the Harris Poll study gets really interesting is in its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and the issue of cooperation the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor right span\nRather that question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've sent to the high court\nWhen respondents were told that the three name witnesses do not cooperate forged claims fifty seven percent said they are in favor of his confirmation\n\nIf the FBI found no cooperation for Ford's claims sixty percent said cabinet should be confirmed pen reports well I've seen this on social media I Can't tell you how many polls I've seen do you believe Ford or do you believe Kavanaugh\nOr was Kevin are credible or what ... that's not a question on the\nAir accused of a long time ago if the premise was wrong everything after that it was wrong man the premise of the question is wrong yes\n\nIt's not whether that did her testimony alone see incredible that's not a question I care about\nDoes hurt testimony in regards to the evidence that exists the facts the facts that exist the evidence that is out there does does she come across as credible thinking about what really at this testimony is all about our ... is the fact\nThat this the entire testimony what her claims are have to be back by something\nSay oh or fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there's no one sixty percent of Americans believe it that's almost all of independence mhm\nYeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we talked about the administration\nAnd said look you could a more successes if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not your goal that'll not\nYour goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying you know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this

I was reading the political article about Mitch McConnell are saying uh you know hey would like to vote this weekend in American really they're saying well if the FBI investigation is finished by Wednesday\nAnd I've been hearing this even though not officially different articles dating that yeah the FBI could get this wrapped up weaving heard\nTuesday right or at a what Sunday or Monday I forgot what I heard that ... and now I hear in Wednesday it can be of a you know wrapped up even though the president has said you know you can expand it but how far do you expand it what does that mean expanding it expanded what ... what allegations\nAnd it well it would be expanding it too and in the in fact the coverage that I read was expanding it to essentially anybody that might be connected with these allegations which is the any other claimed witness along the way\nAnd if you expand into that what you may first of all you may or may not get cooperation from that person is is not a criminal investigation\nShowing they can they can call you or you know ask you a show up at your door and ask you if you would mind talking to them about this but that person doesn't necessarily have to do that\nLegally they don't have to talk to them and it or not they're not this is again not a criminal investigation and that person is not the target it if it were\nAnd there are some people that don't want to be dragged into it you're right they don't want it because they know their name is going to be you know all through the media and that's that's happened this is why it we we thought it was interesting uh\nThat that capital pointed out the many women that supported him because he said basically his point was they knew full well that they were going to be in the public eye for supporting me and we see all the craziness surrounding\nThis why did their privacy now is going to be invaded yet and and and he just even that I knew\nThat he got me doing the right yeah so there are plenty of people here the FBI may call on that may not want to answer the door\n[noise]\nAh you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent you know [laughter]\nEverything election and that like I Know it's a hundred per se I'm Out in the smartest president that we ever had to stand the room right to understand that it's a hundred percent because he won a ... a ... but you know they were remember all the self\nReflection that happen at that time Eric and I went into hysterical laughter Robyn nice kind of time in late November early December twenty sixteen when they started you know getting reflected been saying we need to ... we need\nTo and just start it instead of just flying over flyover country yeah we're about some work boots and some cover all the Amazon we we need to have to buy some having to work I Would say some coveralls and and we need to go into these towns and find out how the people are ... you know how they're thinking oppose will tell you you don't have to go there you\nDon't I don't know if you really don't I don't have to go anywhere to know what a significant portion of the middle class is thinking well\nEven remember the reporter uh who worked for the times that didn't even leave as his apartment to to the stories they said he went\nTo was his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter] but but you know you don't even have to I mean that but it's it is the very basic point that\nHow can you be doing analysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that in an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set a campaign without or that a party would have\nBut I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay it's there are real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania watch Pennsylvania\nBecause there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if\nWe could see that really with out and we did research that they were not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available that ain't no news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or any of them have they have ... rooms filled with people that can I can do that we we\nWe didn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania and Michigan Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information\nThat they had where they started seeing that that the turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people who called ... poles or number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty sixteen will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting thirty days in ... you start seeing that the poll start tightening and by the time you get\nTo a couple of days beforehand but people for example say that the polls for drop are completely wrong no they weren't no there were polls that were dead on for the numbers\nThey may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cause them to do it right or not the the by the time you got to the the the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down you would probably need more votes you wouldn't be need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes\nYou know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to actually do to predict\nBut they did know\nThe internal polls they started knowing about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening\nOr in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and Wisconsin\nBut the fact is the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean just within a half a percentage to a point to the actual numbers and they said don't show Hillary winning or know what show would Hillary would get in the Rob vote and that's what she did get\nVery close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college ... so you know that's something that they've since we've had two electoral you know two very close votes ... ah you know back in two thousand and uh in in twenty sixteen you know maybe they should start looking to see if they could pole and then\nFigure out the electoral college you know that way if there's a better way it was a better way to do it but\nWell you saw back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this precinct here in this state\nAnd all these come together you could see the electoral votes in this state go to that he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as to\nWhere it might go it wasn't based on sentiment\nThat wasn't based on respondents that was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given district\nIn a state you know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore but if you if you watched election night twenty sixteen\nWhat you saw was this I mean it was a very smoggy attitude it was they were almost doing it was almost a parade for her\nHillary Clinton and\nDoing it was almost a parade for her Hillary Clinton and then into the evening the later it got after the polls closed it just went down where there was a downward spiral\nBecause it was reality and they had painted the picture and the media helped of something that wasn't true\nAnd they saw it as landslide without looking at again you know how\nThis might add up right uh but looking at the polls now as we were we were you know doing earlier a ... in our ... show meaning ah I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race Mick Sally versus send them a Christian send them at the Democratic a Democrat and Martha McSally the Republican\nAnd you know the the last repulsive send them up three seven six and three ah and but the but uh in earlier polls are earlier in the month a mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the\nFrom the sixteen to the twenty okay rush still not into the ... the whole cabinet thing and cinema was up by three but margin of error four point seven that's a dead heat\nAnd if you if you look at that overall except for the uh the one likely voter poll by CNN that was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there\nAnd we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote I think a ... and again I think that the cabinet vote has the potential to energize both but I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more\nBe it he whether he is a not confirmed or ... firmed\nThe energy that I see right now the motivation to voter motivation on the right to me as much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the ... because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last two years looking at this mid term right\nAnd so the energy is there I Do think just because how important it is\nWhen you talk about the possibility of and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabin on could get on and do what what what Roberts did you don't know mhm but the possibility and I were talking about were Roberts you know change the uh you know the\nThe wording mhm and Obamacare to actually you know ... to fit the narrative that he wanted to ... people were shot by but on other things when it comes to regulations he is a seems to be a construction it so all Supreme Court justices at times can be a mixed bag\nBut you just you never know how this is going to affect the election it's gonna be interesting to see what the polls are

please don't charge tariffs without tariffs you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here\n[noise] ah I just want to spend a couple of moments on this we know people want to talk about the Kevin all thing but uh this is really a huge deal and I do think that\nUh this is something that the president politically can use a ... to help in the midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the the we got the trade agreement and everything else now the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm uh now the good is we\nDon't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that would be bad if the president decided to go in that in that direction I still don't think we won't know when it's very tough to predict what's going to happen\nBut I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction to begin with because there would have been pushback from Congress yeah in fact I Would I think that President meant to say then that audio we just heard was\nThe threat of tariffs\nBecause she knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it yes\nUh but the the the when you look at the ... the free trade agreement and I got an email today from guy saying you guys will be only to conservatives but think this deal stinks well number one we haven't really given her opinion on the deal and as we said last night\nThere are some parts of it we don't like it all including the major portion that the president has promoted but there's some good things in there\nAre now we did open up some agriculture and dairy now we heard about the dairy that was one of the big things the president promoted but as of Wall Street journal points out\nWe will only expand our market by one percent when it comes to dairy in Canada but still it's movement in the right direction mhm and if you're making that more free trade world for that\nAnd that's a good thing or one of the reasons we didn't hear about timber\nIs because that's one of the victories of Canada got what Canada got was the president remember put the tariff on soft timber or in April I Believe it was well that's going to be retracted and the president just can't

think they specifically didn't put the F in there but the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico had just say this this might have been a little bit off the topic and moving more towards the cabin all thing I Believe I'm\nNot a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the lead be the world's worst\nSelf deprecating humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that you and then came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was that the the summit in Singapore ... after they did the the photo op with Kim Jong Eun he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might be I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think that the other thing that America Mr of course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking\nAnd of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at\nYou know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled and\nAfter the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know a there that nomination then they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and plays and the staff in place that he\nReally second year I think the case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity that may be the president has also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms if it could be either or but I I\nI Do believe that the president has always been in the private sector comfortable in his own shoes\nThat changed when he went from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place or for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign as he became president\nAnd I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and it has now does what he can do what he can't do I think there's probably a little more thought based on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning on the cabinet nominees should they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to them then expanded the whole thing on Monday\nHe's winning when you look at the things that that he's put out there aside from some gas communication wise president is winning the left is screaming because not because they think that they're winning they know he's winning\nThey know he's resonating in the media especially that's why they call it the resistance than the first place\nIf you want to get in line drove an eight six six Ninety right I Will get to more of your calls in a comments on the uh uh Kavanaugh investigation FBI investigation and what the Mitch McConnell may do and will there be a vote this weekend that more all on the way for radio road log who's your

hey when elections that's what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah what is it the same somebody's character\nBecause\nThat's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah position so that does and anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the womb numb all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom well\nAt least they do with how often did you pick your mother that domestic abuse yes I'm Sorry I was a little Matty to our last caller yeah just a little ... little ... little over the top and you

someone [laughter] in a bar legit I let's let's go out and we do need to say that the kids were in a bar\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the desperate attempt by the left when they know they're losing even if Kavanaugh they don't get the confirmation votes for Kavanaugh what do you do when the eggs split\n...\n[laughter] yeah well it's you know a a Newsweek now pointing out that he lied about having no connections to Yale\nWhen they can show his grandfather attended ... which would make him in turn a light just a legacy student and in two thousand eleven\nThese prestigious universities including Yale Harvard Princeton said that roughly twenty five percent of their new admissions could be considered legacy students this is reaching\n[laughter] this is ... [laughter] you\nMay have had too much to drink and then when they had to go home out well you tell\nThem you know he he may have drank in\nHigh school and college I don't know how much I have to but I Hope to get to work everybody else's trip and I don't know how you're seriously dropping something I don't know what it is but I Would not driver operate heavy machinery anywhere in the near future let's say nothing before years and\nOh please ... home\n\nWhile I Can't believe we actually got a good oh yeah we need to go back to the room\n[laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\n\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nOh wait a minute Ken sin I retire now if I Want to go out on a high note I Want to say but last call I ever\nWell actually I saw the\n... over the weekend or it may actually may have been last week when Kavanaugh was born\nHe did what many male babies do on nurses you find female nurses [laughter] it was to make it in front of three nurses yeah he was born at yes that's ... yeah well and if you're the if you've ever been in that room\nAnd witness that when a male is born also what they do\nAlmost first before they cry let's just say there's a reason they wear those gloves and masks well so we're going to go back to that story about the college professor then [laughter] yeah right they\nGeorgetown professor who says why Republicans should be castrated and fed into swine and fed the swine yes a professor at Georgetown University known for making incendiary comments\n[laughter] that's for sure like comment against supporters of president Donald Trump said white Republican men deserve miserable deaths for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid Christine fair and associate professor at Georgetown in the school of foreign service we didn't Saturday same white Republican men should die an added bonus would be a woman castrated their corpses and feed them just whine and to quote\nOkay\nWell that went south quickly [laughter]\nWe can't have a debate [laughter] you can't have a debate that's the whole point you can't and this is\nWhat I said earlier and we got than there's further the this is further proof of it there's no coming back from the brink and the ... from the ... in terms of the far left in America today there's not a\nWell you ... you said ... will they come off the brink she's over it oh yeah yeah that's ... she made offensive comments on social media telling a Muslim Trump supporter to do\nMath\nOff and go to hell ...\nGeorgetown University said bears views are her own and not the views of the university yeah running a statement to the Daily Caller\nYeah in other words we don't want this to affect student enrollment were you know uh we believe she might have crossed the line\nThere that I have a line\nIn my mind and I know I'm just about where it is by the way the last thing that we ever want to do\nThis is why when we talk about free speech and they want to shut us up and then we don't want to shut them up and that's why we don't want to shut them up there I never want to stop\nThat Georgetown professor ... letting people know exactly what she thinks that's why free speech is beautiful beautiful because she doesn't hide it you know who she is and what she said and what she thinks\nAnd I don't think it's a Georgetown can make their own decision on whether she remains or not that's up to them we're not calling for anything\nKnow we know what populate the halls of these universities\nWe know we know what populate the halls of these universities we know who these individuals are please keep it up\nAt
