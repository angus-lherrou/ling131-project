Congress edition and the blockade and the position that the administration has taken on that will there be any change in that will they looked at it differently being that the biggest military base that we have is their right but I Do huh how that might change if\nI don't think it'll have much of a change it'll make discoveries a little bit more welcome here in Washington but by and large ah we're all that we've now got to the point where the countries are comfortable with the relationship with us or they're having a by annual\nA strategic dialogue with us or they continue to buy large quantities of military equipment the basic functions very well if anything that base has become more important right\nOr so from the point of view I think this is a a fear I'd say it's not for us but they're already in a in a good place\nThe country that I think is going to be most affected by this and one of the other Gulf states will be the you ate a because my ... been sort of mine is seen as the protege\nOf the crown prince of the UAE he Mohammed ... who's a who's older and smarter\nAnd for or came over and it was meant able to use Mohammed been so much to carry much of the ... agenda I mean for example and it's pretty clear to everybody in the region or the campaign against cutter was dreamed up by the U.S have the ... of the reasons\nAnd uh [noise] my ... was persuaded to go along a\n... and also the you a he has a very much taken the lead Healy is pursuing a separate policy from Saudi Arabia and Yemen are you a seems to be trying to live off the southern part of Yemen make an independent country dependent on the UAE eat\nRight and the Iraqi has been using shouting power to pressure the money's falling in line with him so far successfully but they needed the Saudis to be able to do that\nWell\nAll of a sudden a Saudi Arabia is got to be rather toxic war or the ... as well so a large part of what they have been doing their own policies in the region\nHave been based upon the fact of fame and able uh because of the personal relationship between the two crown princes are they able to get the Saudis to back them under actually everything and that now becomes a much more difficult stories of south or in the region\nMissouri back to what you're saying\nSo I\nMiss her back to what you're saying is the Iranians might want to distance themselves from mom and dad and some a little bit and still has\nA I think at least in the public perception of it really going to have to do that\nRight [noise] and I'm only got a couple more minutes as your bathroom ... I Want to get your take on Nikki Haley's resignation I Know the president says he's interviewing five people you were in that world your former ambassador to the state of cutter now president of the U.S governor business\nCouncil what did you think of the timing of ambassador Haley's resignation and he sees a viable replace\n\nA the timing I think has two parts to it\nShe didn't want to do I make it look like shoes voting at the end of the first half of the term uh she needed to give the president enough time she's going to stay on the job till the end of the year ... which gives the president last time so I think she was I think she's got personal reasons for leaving\nA\nShe has been in politics for so long or they're in the newspaper stories that her personal family finances are or not and really great shame and I'll tell you or we don't pay and our ... very well I mean this\nIs a prejudice I used to be one myself\nBut we really don't pay or ambassador is very well\nAnd uh\nLiving in New York I don't ... even though there's extra as it doesn't come anywhere near covering the cost of living are living in being the ambassador of New York and all the things you have to do\nA ... it's a it's a huge burden we've got this problem in a number of other major countries around the world like blood and so forth so\nIf you ask me I think it was simply a she didn't realize being governor of state is one thing you know she's a she's a good person she's an honest person\nSo I don't think she was taking advantage of her official position but if you're in New York on a on the salaries of the state department pays the math or even the fact that you're tossing in the house so if they really\nDoesn't cover it so I think\nThey may have been a personal economic necessity to step aside for a little bit much should also be a great asset for the Republican Party in a couple of years' time she is she's smart or she can take middle positions\nUh she uh\nShe's very articulate she looks sassy a little bit sassy and breath but that's OK that works in today's politics\nAs well and of course she's now we'll learn a minority which is something that the Republican Party really desperately need [noise]\nFor its future I think she has a long term future she's young not so sure that when you're twenty twenty four maybe\nShe somebody Iran I don't know if she wants to run for president but she is going to be a a person who can get a who can really get a lot of people who today wouldn't vote Republican\nReplacement\nWho will be here replaced\nA replacement I have no idea uh I've I've been looking at a little bit at the names I it really boils down to whether or not a John Bolton has a\nBig voice right in this election or John boulders or for whatever it is good qualities are is very much a fire bomb thrower and he's going to be\nTrying to persuade the president to come up with someone like that which I think was a mistake when he was\nA part in the United nations or he basically lost his ability to control a to control that party because a lot of the way you the the us functions that a lot of the stuff that we get that we actually get a lot more done\nThen you would think from the newspaper accounts but most of that Congress because if you got a smart ambassador who reaches out to people makes a lot of friends\nOr the UN is a place for a guy who knows how to make out of ... grant small a lot of small favors add a lot of the small countries who voted the un really need those small favorite city of the U.S ambassador to the United nations\nUh\nKnows how to play these people well it fits a transactional game but you know I made sure of the city of New York doesn't really enforce all the parking tickets you guys got I get your vote the couple of things and this is the way the\nUn operates under the uh\nI did all the fancy stuff at the top are under the big news so what we need is some is issues or or this is a perfect place if there's any southern politicians there this is the perfect place for southern\nDish uh\nThese guys are real experts such closing so that's where I Would uh put my cars but whether or not they are so I can tell because I I it depends on who's who's got the president's here I'm just what I mean this is the most important ... oil position or\nThe bachelor or the United nations is the only American ambassador who sits regularly a cabinet meetings\nAnd has instant access to the president\nSo uh it's a very very important position\nOr you need you need to balance is so carefully as to who you're put in that position I mean that's the qualifications I don't know what the inner workings are right now inside the White House to decide who is going to be the the job or not\nWell we heard record now from Germany has a interview but we've also heard that the president is I'm a woman\nTo take the place to Nikki Haley so are those are in conflict so no no one knows we do know that he's interviewed by people but sounds like he's going to make it very deliberate decision\nBut it's very interesting what you're saying and certainly the profile that you outlined doesn't exactly say national Judy director John Bolton who doesn't exactly he's not ... ... ... type like can I say is humming animal\nWhat it looked at the first and most important job of any president United States it's productive citizens from all enemies both foreign and domestic and he swears for the constitution that he's going to do that and other than that commitment\nIs making sure that us citizens are protected\nAnd allowing seven thousand individuals who are undocumented come into the country is not a protection\nWe're the most welcoming country that will take a million immigrants a year into the country more than any other country in the world we are a nation of immigrants but there is a proper like you do this and so I think the president's going to work with Mexico to try and get their leaders to stop at at least slow this care of and that but also mentally\nWhat we need is a woman in the southern border and without the wall we will have a human wall of military people school ensure that people were\nCountry illegally are not allowed to do that and I know it sounds harsh and I'm not advocating for violence what I'm advocating for is the right way of doing things and if that means those people who are coming here I Believe many of them are using children\nAnd they're using you know look John think about it you're going to take a woman and her child and have her walk two thousand miles which is the distance we're talking about two thousand miles with nothing but the clothes on her back issues in her feet you know for child\nWalking through Central America and I'll up through Mexico and that's a good idea to hopefully get to the United states only to be turned around it doesn't make any sense I Believe part of this has been organized by people in the mid term elections or two weeks away and want to make this a political issue and I don't know who's\nFunding it but I Am gravely concerned about part of some of the people who may be in that caravan who aren't here for political asylum and are only here to try and hurt in the United states\nSo Cory is this going to backfire I mean if indeed it was set for or was inspired for political reasons right so that we can get back to the narrative of kids in cages in a zero tolerance and that a fiasco\nThat went down on that policy is this something that could actually backfire now when the Democrats\nWell I think it does backfire because if you remember John you look when Hillary Clinton was a U.S senator she voted for a border wall I Am going to war but the fence okay that was\nThere was money that was supposed to be allocated for that are complaining about this president has asked for by both Republicans and Democrats was give me the financial resources available on the southern border\nAnd what the president offered which I thought was very aggressive was a pathway to citizenship for those individuals\nOr in the country through what they call no fault of their own coming to refer to his dreamers the president offered that in ... in in relation to give me the for the wall you give me the money will put a path forward and the Democrats\nDidn't get that done they didn't want that done because they want to politicize this and now that we're two weeks to the day from the mid term elections the issue of immigration is that the forefront again\nAnd from in crummy issues perspective I don't think it helps for Democrats because they had been soft on immigration and soft on open borders and that's not where the American people are by and large\nAs we go into the midterms now Cory there's a new poll out by the Washington Post just today and it's basically looked at not just the generic ballot which has people running for Congress in Los Angeles and and a New York city ... center with wide leads\nThat influenced the generic ballot but it looked at the fifty most closest races all toss ups that are going to basically decide who can trolls the house of representatives\nAnd in this poll the post had to admit that all of the races that the Democrats are leading had tightened\nAnd now Republicans read the tighter ahead and the tide in the district that matter\nWas turning in the direction of the president\nAnd his party and the wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the president's approval rating is up to get this forty seven percent right that's up dramatically from where I was just not that far back how do you read this\nWell John it's clearly a good sign for the Republicans they had some wind up their backs if you look at historical\nPerspective this president is now more popular at his first term than many others going into their mid terms including Brock Obama but the media doesn't want to say that they don't want to talk about that narrative it almost always gets glossed over but your earliest point on this topic is the most important in the places where the Democrats are supposed to win in a walk\nIn seats where they knew that they had good candidate and they were going to walk up those elections and pull away early\nThey haven't been able to do that and then the competitive Republican district I just think Virginia whether it's a David Braddock Scott Taylor or Barbara Comstock in the races where the republic tend to eat we see\nThem not only holding on but expanding some legion in places with two weeks ago\nBy and large not on every case basis Republicans are in a better position today than they were just last week and what that means is\nVoters are coming home they're seen the more money in their paychecks they're seen more money in their bank account they're single or job opportunities and they know what's at stake in the November elections which is returning a majority\nTo give us less regulation more tax cuts\nReturning a majority to give us less regulation more tax cuts and an opportunity to grow our businesses or going back to the way it used to be which is putting a majority in place which wants to overburden you with government rules and regulations\nAnd believe that the government is the solutions to problems so I think people are realizing it squarely focus now part of the reason that they're squarely focus is the Trump Pence team\nHas been on the road campaigning all over the country in key congressional district key Senate races to make sure voters know exactly what's at stake in two weeks\nYou're with the John ... radio network you're Godzilla the truth in America we're with Corey Lewandowski\nHe is the author he's known authors kind of amazing you you went from campaign manager to Trump for president\nToo and author he's written a best selling book to let Trump be Trump a must read on the campaign you could buy that'd be Dalton you can buy that Amazon your favorite books written by wherever you want so uh it's really neat and he's also coming out with a brand new book on November twentieth\nTrump's enemies from within and he'll be naming names about some of the shenanigans that goes on in the White House every day and he's also with a vice president Mike Pence political action committee which is a hard it's hard money\nPack and so he's traveling with the VP around the United states trying to win as many key congressional and Senate races as they can Corey there was an article yesterday published in the New York times about an altercation\nBetween yourself and uh John Kelly chief of staff back in February where the alleged that he grabs your neck tie which seems kinda odd to me it doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would do that is that fake news or that real\nYou know John ... it's amazing they talk about something that may have transpired from uh eight or nine months ago right like I've got a very good relationship with John John Kelly on behalf of the president to make sure that the president's agenda implemented I Do it from the outside John does it from the inside\nAnd and we've agreed to work together very closely to make sure that the Trump Pence agenda continues to get implemented so you know the stories\nOf chaos in the White House are clearly over on the stories of mayhem a trail and this is on those narratives that the media wants to talk about because it suits their agenda as opposed to what's really going on which is more Americans back to work\nMore people working now than ever before in our history more of the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics in recorded history the world's unemployment rate for women and sixty five years that for the American people care about and everything else is just salacious you know real rumors innuendo\nLet's get to the to show you fair President Trump yesterday Corey saying that he was not particularly convinced about the Saudi narrative what happens now\nLook at I I don't think there's any questions at the Saudi has a responsibility to place to show 'em but we should also understand that this should not be surprising to many people are this is something\nThat it you know I well I don't travel to Saudi Arabia or other parts of the world unfortunately happens all too often but there has to be accountability what that accountability I don't know what we need to get all the facts um but as you know the latest part of this story is that uh they had a body double wearing his show gets close walking around to\nMake it look like the guy was still alive they've now admitted he's dead\nThey said it was a result of a fist fight I called I didn't get a question about a national security expert and ... and that the American people don't have\nAre just entering a very basic perspective it seems very difficult to imagine a man of issue in age getting into a fist fight with Fifteen other professionals and I'm thinking that that's going to result in the outcome\nAnd and it clearly didn't put we need to make sure we know what an appropriate response is we have to get all the facts and it's something that I\nHappened very quickly because there shouldn't be accountability is what we believe transpired would transpire\n[noise] well I think the president is going to act he said he was going to get with Congress and find a bi partisan way to respond to this but we're

N. and find\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second member to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see what sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the clock ticks place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your authorities to see what they can do to\nPrevent the next attack and you and says armed guards at many of your scenario\nYeah that's that's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and offend a God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman\nOr a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays well Shawn and you'll keep poured many synagogues you do have\nA local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this is just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is it's sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population\nBut to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out for very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had you know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard a non Israeli non Jewish leader say\nThose who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that mark from any leader\nAnd not only was it that ... that I did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the applause he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he fit that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremist like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nYou know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer and brace David do we repudiate people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which has been mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even somewhat in the United states\nThis again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic anti ... anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the ... general assembly U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past if not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with the ... we have always been seen as can area of the ... in the coal mine\nIn of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the news\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside\nAnd stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and they noticed kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely with putting politics aside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states tier media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump this Trump this is Trump is\nAnd this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump he's headed to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American is a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\nYeah I mean I I said this before or we've never had a stronger supportive of Israel with President Trump\nA and frankly it hasn't even been close in terms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the signature on some [noise]\nAnd the case to be ... the most anti Semitic regime and the planet they call for the annihilation of one and only two state and you have Hezbollah uh ... Iran did actually one of his bowl as leaders that a few years ago that he hoped all the Jews will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there\nFor the president of the United states stood up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran has storage sank tens and against Iran and in doing so he is starved is anti Semitic terrorists regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be used to pick your dreams\nAnd promote a Israelis are and and also to putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal it's bought Israel or in the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support and like I said I'm very grateful\nThat the president so forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack I think it it is a very very important I think if people think that all of these things happened uh because of\nPresident Trump's election ... they're just getting themselves they don't understand the history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred older sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews or or\nHad been attacked and killed you know for being a capital for being a communist for being a the biggest dollars for being the biggest hawks for being called for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate us and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts\nAnd I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific acts keep than together again at the ... is President Trump is not the reason why you have like Jeremy Corbyn\nAnd you know uh the head of the Labour Party and anti Semite it's not that we're in a while you have all these attacks and for many years and you're up against fortunately this thing is\nComing here to the United states and ... and is now eleven uh worshipers and hail a Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite thoughts\nAnd people should stand together against this and out the anti Semite on the side of the political wild that's\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own head whether it's David Duke whether it was there ever comes when it's not a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and fame and demonizing Israel and make all these charges that Israel's apartheid state races state a perpetrator of canon dot\nWhich I think a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel but you don't see of any other country this demonization ever is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the schools I think they're going
