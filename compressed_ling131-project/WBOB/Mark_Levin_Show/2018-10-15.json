don't know how far but it's all the way back to the Steve Forbes for president campaign and\nMy when it was this let's say it was it that it was it Ninety to Ninety six Ninety safe campaign and forms that come from nowhere but block and was his pollster\nA Bob Dylan supposed to be the show and and in January Forbes had ten point lead in New Hampshire\nThey was going to win it last year that we ended up winning Delaware and Arizona and gotten plane was going to a New Hampshire but then\nWho is the chairman it's a Haley Barbour went to McLaughlin and they wanted to or they want the forms and they were whining about negative and he was doing a dull and he was going to hurt the party and Steve Forbes Gene Gene player check them down and then do end up I think winning New Hampshire but\nThey kept them up there I think for was would have been the nominee 'cause they were to win New Hampshire but that's just me\nAnd the guy behind it all John McLaughlin who's with us now John it's great to any man\nIt's great to be on the cat on the venture that or I ... I Want to know if\nThey can blame before Iowa and they were right behind him in Ireland and a a dull and the ... Iowa closely and a cat and ended up winning New Hampshire and then for as long Delaware in Arizona\nAnd ended up winning New Hampshire and then for one Delaware in Arizona and uh but but by then that the establishment gang up on us\nI Know but I did get the story is I Do remember the half that Haley Barbour when did you guys was whining about your\nYour negative ads and are now you you should doubled down and told them I\nI ... I\nWas in my mid food in the times so I don't know but\nBut in the meantime he's been good part is mostly as we ram a positive is Steve raised a lot of issues that are alive today where where he raised the idea of the flat tax and and pro growth tax cuts and medical savings accounts and tired of it\nAnd he really ran as a home care aid that was really a a a full runner of Donald Trump right now so uh uh a lot of the issues that he raised their alive today you know and very well and and it would serve our country well if they acted on those things\nAbsolutely John tell us about your association I Know you're associate with a couple of things you associate with the ban\nPacking told me that and then also job creators network but tell me about what you see happening out there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the Kavanaugh situ ways you can you share with her audience John McLaughlin what that is\nWell are you sure what it is is is a um I think who's the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court\nIt was really a play or by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to try to win the Senate and when you look at the field of of Senate seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year twenty six are in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats\nOr Tony fix the seats\nAnd Tana those feet of the Democratic seats are in states Trump won by a one in the ... presidential election so midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential\nBut a lot of the people that vote in the presidential don't come out in the mid term so when Trump brand our strategy was to bring out millions of new voters that Mitt Romney didn't appeal to get them look around and vote for it so we got\nRight now so it's going to be very very close or or they could think Seventy five seats up and went handling let's go over the U.S Senate I'm going to give you the races you tell me what you think that's certainly the two states are Republicans have to haul Nevada Dean Heller Z Jacky Rosen\nWell I think that one that wasn't that depends upon if they get enough from voters out\nA particularly outside of Orange County\nUh to be able to watch our county and other parts of Nevada so that they're able to win that Senate scene offset what's probably going to be a bit of a ticking Hispanic voters I was I was in the Trump campaign those are the only polls from primary day election day but the president but I thought\nThought the end when I was going to the analytics with a ... gallon Jared Kushner employee sixteen\nThere was a surge of Hispanic voters and we were playing that said we thought it was a toss up but when I saw that the increase in Hispanic voters at the end I thought we were going to lose that seat to him in Colorado is different in Florida Florida ... increased Hispanic voters and came in\nAnd they're more likely low for us to Nevada devout is a real concern right now\nAll right Arizona congressman Mick Sally is she going to win\nI think so because\nShe's the right candidate sees what's really key as everybody thought she was in a ... a a Republican in in the primary she embraced the president\nOf the president likes her she's the uh the first woman combat fighter pilot or who happens to be in Congress and now running for the Senate she's running against another woman who is a lot more radical open borders Democrat which is not good at Arizona\nA a ... a semi so uh so I think my salary wins that one\nOkay so let's go to the new ones where the Republicans had the chance to pick up so it looks like based on what you said right now just send it to the whole state said down one alright Montana\nRosendale Jon Tester\nI think tester wins out when the Trump voters come out test has been very early in the campaign was running an ad saying that he supports President Trump and a ... he lost them fingers in an accident was counting the number on his fingers and are\nThey ran out of fingers at some point it was a tutor clever at if you supported the president but he no longer support the president [laughter] so uh\nUh so I think he loses because he is the hypocrisy of what he was trying to pull off okay Missouri Josh how\nThe the hypocrisy of what he was trying to pull off\nOkay Missouri huh Josh Holly and the Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill Claire\nLose we're to pull out this week she was down eight so I I don't know if she'll lose by eight foot but ah she got her badly by the uh uh her opposition the

by that again in the panhandle is an area that\nThe Trump campaign we knew we were going to go into the water would boost to turn out there to help us when the state of Florida so uh\nYou know there's a real bad event with this hurricane coming in right now so uh um hopefully you know our friends in Florida are are taking care of and the hurricane doesn't do that much damage so uh but that's a dead even race right now and we're Scott could win that that would really\nYou know just wipe out or any plans to Democrats have a ticket to the Senate\nNorth Dakota Kevin Cramer Heidi Heitkamp\nHum we've had holes were doing work there for the Republican Jewish coalition and she downtown so a a crime has got to be the next to a Center for me and what it's really about is\nNorth Dakota is one of those energy states where I'm well while Obama was president the Democrats were voting to you know put climate control restrictions on and cut back on on shale oil production and kill the Keystone Pipeline\nSo if if you're doing well now because of the energy economy growing in doing well uh you don't want to go back to those democratic policies where you know you'll be looking for work and moving around so uh and they got the same thing in West Virginia West Virginia coal fate\nYou know there were people out of work minds were closed people you know I mean you were left with an opioid crisis because you couldn't find a job and uh uh so I think mentioned in real trouble in West Virginia\nAnd he could see that when he was the only Democrat to vote for a capital\nA so I think I think ... North Dakota's definitely go Republican and a\nWest Virginia could end the really interesting thing is in West Virginia ... daughter is affiliated lobbies for the company that produces that'd be tens and was was court price gouging\nAnd now there's an app pens shortage were kids can't get them to go to school because if they have these allergic reactions\nThey can't they can inject themselves with whatever it is that that would save their lives\nAnd uh this there seems to be some sort of a you know phony shortage or or of they haven't produced these app pens because the price gouging so you mentioned may be caught in some sort of ethical family a issue there\nI think more she's going to win that race Jon I rarely do I've been saying that for some time I know all the polls show mansion up uh I don't see it I think more as he is going to win we'll see how it plays out okay to more Indiana Mike Braun income of the incumbent\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly\nPrior to the cabinet thing uh uh Dali was still had he's perceived as some sort of moderate Democrat but he voted for Gorsuch last year didn't vote for cabinet this year now he's in a dead even race so that once a toss up\nOkay and uh my friends are telling me that Bob who has a shot over Bob and then there's a New Jersey I don't believe that I'm from New Jersey I Know John you spend a lot of time there\nYou know having grown up they're like no way and it's been in as going to lose at my right or wrong where did you grow up Madison New Jersey\n... you can read more\nMiami someone to drew the bad neighborhoods\nGuy when I went to uh I I went I graduate in and play baseball that's fairly Dickinson right across the street from drew\nIt yeah yeah my son played basketball for drew that was their big cross town rival\nSo they were they were literally just selling the audience understand that there are two major colleges drew university and fairly Dickens and they were virtually across the highway\nAnd so when I was in fairly tickets in the big thing was the drill girls were much better looking than a fairly Dickens girls so we always went over there\nFor obvious reasons but uh that was in and this is what we did play baseball and I did shut them out twice so I Love playing at drew anyway let's get back to this race and that\nYou just boil your Supreme Court nomination done\nAnyway no but seriously he ... down and all the polls ... has been running really good ads reminding people that when then does was under indictment his ... his co conspirator was convicted and for some reason then does got off with a hunk trial\nAnd uh uh so you know if if if ethics and a character ... New Jersey\nYou're getting to be the next center and pull off a huge upset so bumping into 'em upside down underwater whether his unfavorable to higher than his farewell statewide\nSo uh uh and it's because of that ethical a problem that he had where uh they definitely is is\nThat the fellow who the fellow that at the doctor a Belgian that who was who was trying to do favors for with with Medicare and other things to uh ended up getting convicted and and uh\nAnd and in the meantime ... you know got off on some technicality but says the charges or for real\nBased on our conversation I've got the Republicans picking up six seats Montana majority Florida North Dakota in West Virginia Indiana holding Arizona losing Nevada\nAnd that gives them a corner in mind that plus five\nWell that's that's all possible I think some of those I'd I'd had John Indiana and and uh I'm Glad you know maybe\nWe may maybe Florida right now so uh uh you know in ... New Jersey so three of those are you know dead even race is so\nYou know you got four weeks ago and the Republicans have a chance to win but they need to get they really need to uh uh you know be very aggressive during these four weeks to make sure that every every Trump quote or a devoted in twenty sixteen comes back out this time\nAll right John McLaughlin a great conversation we got to have you back just before the Germans John always a pleasure to have you know we go back such a long time I'm Glad you're older son went to drill although it's very good shot as you're not\nI agree with you the problem is is that today what you're watching on the networks and what they try to do today on the Sunday shows\nThese they're trying to say well the kittens are the ones who are acting out of the main shooting the Republicans are acting with how grave because they're celebrating\nEven now they are celebrating with having to worry about you guys have hung out with a room so what I think we need to once again do John news outlets that narrative let that men get through there and we need to remind everyone\nThere that are twenty nine days as you said we need to remind people\nWhat we are voting not only for both retired term diseases that nationals all we're voting against him were voting on a cat and\nThe less this radical agenda bugs that Iraq Obama party that wants to impeach Donald Trump with that new one\nThat has given me and we can get in a way to not only their people but to the Chinese but to the Iranians but to the\nUm [noise] but to the other Middle Eastern countries at our enemies and also frankly our ... our European allies adult like Trump\nSaying just hold out just pulled out don't worry we're going to get we're going to remove him from office\nAnd they are going to want to function like do you remember seeing they're going to want anarchy heading into the twenty twenty cycle because they cannot have Donald Trump be successful this experiment and not work because if it's going to change the direction of our country forever\nAnd we're no longer going to how we're going to have a successful citizen price it and I know he was an abnormal citizen in terms of being an international mogul a magnet for going to have a citizen who is\nBringing you know very very intellectual yes but um [noise] common sayings I represent me in the ... men and women and they don't know what to do with that so\nWe need to make sure once again that we hold the seat I just heard your enrichment I just ... you know you're all over her Jane yeah\nI think we can hold every seat in Virginia except for maybe one maybe two\nBut you know what it looked like we were going to lose six or seven seats there a couple of months ago we went everything any concept pulled it out but everybody has to vote because not only are you voting rights child in support of tracing complex which are voting against\nAny voting in the left wing ... billion less mobbed ... I mean unless you want to change\nOur Adler on TV every day pushing through articles of impeachment I personally don't like looking at that so I'll let you wanted your prerogative both\nThe vote in Virginia in these congressional districts his chest skin is just as important thing or maybe more important than it was in twenty sixteen\nI Would agree with that and now has already gone on record\nAnd said this is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee which you would think\nThat now that would basically re launched an investigation against a sitting Supreme Court justice and basically wind the clown show up for a second time\nI don't know how this is going to be helpful he's been dead for all we have a process and that's that than the other thing is this economy is amazing and it's not getting the money or anywhere near the president\nDid should on friday economic figures come out we have three point seven percent unemployment the lowest in the nation\nSince Nineteen sixty nine minutes fifty years sixty nine that's when the Mets won the world championship was sixty nine\nOkay so long ago did one other factor with this is along with the lowest unemployment what the media doesn't tell you is Fifteen million additional Americans have entered\nThe job market seeking work\nWere permanently put on the job during the two thousand eight nine great recession so\nWe have a record number of people job market and then along with that record unemployment I mean this economy is incredible Trump gets you know read it with a legacy media Sam Nunberg\nWell of course he's not and die I find that a ... it was it was more than laughable because I got to a block Obama believes that\nBelieve a lot of Adam south quickly remember when Obama was made his first campaign of here and I'm In Illinois and he said just remember when this recovery started yeah I Do remember when the recovery started started probably\nWin Pennsylvania went for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and they knew that\nUm that left wing stagnant no growth policies where they just want to regulate out of business right like they want to regulate us more than you're regulated in Europe um we're always no lawyer was no longer in power in America would back\nWe're no longer go longer in power and America was back to doing business and and the most important one of the most important in fact I find to\nJohn is this prosperity is sprayed everywhere and what do I mean by that is when you look at the economic consumer confidence and\nIt's really being pushed up\nIf you read it in the wall Street Journal if you read in the Financial Times or any other website read them at the highest levels it's ever been because of Africa is because of America is making under fifty thousand dollars and the last eight years those American didn't even know if they were getting paycheck\nThat's where we wound up leaving the workforce now as you just were talking about living in the workforce looking for better jobs\nThat's where I Know a lot of job so now that\nI mean that's the one untold story of Trump's economy is that it is an economy benefiting working class men and women like never before and one of the Democrats talk about one percent\nIt's a lot of nonsense obviously everybody is benefiting and this is not trickle down on its push up because Trump's economic recovery from the first day has been aimed\nAt middle America and lower income working an unemployed Americans that's what he's focused on Sam Nunberg and that's what he's getting the success that we're with Sam Nunberg he was a long time political operative or Donald J Trump he was on the Trump campaign\nSeems now a senior advisor\nTo Stephen King Bannon's new\nPolitical action committee citizens for the American republic or car as we can call it was it\nAn acronym that's an outside political groups that the ... summer gets and flooding the TV and radio waves the head of the midterms and Steve I'm Bad and also the author of the movie Trump at war\nYou can Google that Fifteen minutes check it out Trump at war Sam Nunberg with us and let's get two winners and losers in your mind on the Republican side cabinet or any side the Kavanaugh victory who is the biggest one is\n[noise] well I think the ... obviously the biggest winner is the American people and these are republic because now we have\nNot only were able to build a Kennedy they can see with a another strict construction as I Know Kennedy has had some decisions we all like\nFor a member wasn't Kennedy who legalized Obamacare right it wasn't Kennedy

choice\nBy having calving out not come out and given that response in his opening statement after Ford testimony\nYou would've had he probably would not have that\nRight and he would he would have had

laughing at that one day a day off so they were acting like a Russian a Soviet communists mom you know a mob trial the Chinese pull up euro again\nOn getting cabin out so I think that that was very

Sharpton is tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we by the pool if you believe in what you're saying\nSee there's a ... year for Republicans we think taxes shock because we think outside of our military and our courts you flush somebody down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove what's right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free market and charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big ... flush and you flush it down to Paul and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise that all\nFair share or not they don't they already patriots cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah\nWhy do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers freebie maybe after Sylvia where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component which Trump that we didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year of my life that my wife and I really you've done well um my show the book things did well they did thanks a lot of you by the way but things just did well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government\nI was astonished I really was that will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda were not cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I play it straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island played straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law stinks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself I'm Serious\nFolks and my wife is probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I made it because I think this needs to get out there I grew up at the low end at best the middle class and being generous cause I'm not I'm not a sob story\nThe low end the middle class at best okay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm ... now they're\nClass like yeah we will a mistake was not I was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department and the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service and you finally get to a point in your life\nAnd for the first time you make what could be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so yummy we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this\n\nBut you think to yourself I got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was to do what were these\nTwo are you serious to do what I don't mind my cat I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I\nMilitary guys take my money [laughter] is we need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they are just burning it\n\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrat in D.C to flush down the toilet bowl\nThe worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up\nAt the lower and middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later\nOn I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care and making them I Try to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be\n\nBut I guess is that I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over\nAnd they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not [noise] but I just I'm paying by every ounce of it it\nJust sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn All right so I get off track you could tell them kind of hard on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\n\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent pay Ninety\nSeven percent of all income taxes ... percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes\nNinety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter\nIt matters folks because the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent if the topic the pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than the bottom fifty three percent of the tax code so\nThis Bloomberg peace they did it interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or does it still makes sense at a second I promise what percentage are a number of the highest and earners also\nPay and equivalent three percent of the tax law like the bottom fifty percent of the earners\nIn the country\nLadies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders types\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comma for zero zero for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in the country\n\nPercent of income taxpayers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face with a straight face how they're not paying their fair share\nFourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or at the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders of one percent or so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely\nYou read it for the rich no no no no no no no I'm In it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share of its fair share what you should be making this doping stupid talking points rich do pay their fair

why how much of it and what did what Thomas ... who I I don't know probably know the economists last philosopher he's\nThere's no probably know the economists slash philosopher he's both I admire more currently alive today than Thomas all wasn't it handles set at one point I I Can't remember between conflict divisions and visited the annoyed and all this wonderful books I read is\nWhen a PHD report you did on say as long as ... love Thomas all he put this thing was well how much of my stuff basically are you in title do and why or\nWhy I don't get it like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy do what do we owe you\nCopies call could not have been more illuminating\nReally I Am thankful she called I usually don't take a to Z law the first call in so much liberal he was kind of a moderate guy but Cathy that was one of the greatest calls ever\nBecause that really sums up liberalism in a nutshell they have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand the facts they don't understand the economic data about\nTax policy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea\nThey're convinced other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly did rich people take your stop talking well how what stuff that they take they took my money what really where where was because if they're worth a billion dollar how did they get that money from you\nKnow I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\nThey're hypocrites there total front I remember running for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story it up I used to go there there's a the the Maryland the Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P booth and shake hands with people and one day the staffer for Chris Van Hollen it used to be represented and now he's a senator from Maryland [noise] he stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said don't listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth to a bunch of bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask us of all you're liberal friends\nHow much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government did go how much\nThe answer I can almost ashore you with me or certainty is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not hypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument\nNow the government is such a force for good the rich people should get\nMore is that money to go why why please explain to me how we have been paying into these anti poverty programs since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member to work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not moved the poverty rate in any significant\nWay at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and a number of people working that are eligible family members the number of percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would work that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\nWhile simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government\nWhy did you do that why if the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them don't be a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake\nNo serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government you know I Do everything in my power to pay accountants to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that\nNo one serious I don't have that issue I look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks\nTax I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government whether it's masking senses they spend they waste money like no tomorrow government it's thanks it's a disaster I have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror know yep I Do everything legally I can to pay as few tax dollars as possible but not you frauds you don't pay extra you want me to pay more you don't do anything to give\nYou might say well than with a couple of people do voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweed me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read a report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe this number\nTwelve million dollars million\nNot billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country are you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberals say there are thirty million liberals was probably more than that probably closer forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals status twenty five million if each\n\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and faith if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government the paltry twelve million dollars\nThat's it so lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and frauds wake up tomorrow morning call your account did do the right thing by air quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing\nRight a big fat juicy check to the G\nGo do it call your account and come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good baddie took things\nStick to cut gangs take lots to change the go had knock your sounds out set an example for the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals lookout slabs freaked out\nThe conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals forecasts labs we donated a nest on a strike hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments [noise] nice job liberals dumb but nice job at least you guys have a spy we stood for something your big frauds\nPhony phony fakes\nLook yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are\nI don't want to pay extra pill everybody else does why why I'd give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI give that we we my wife and I get the charity we sell short shorts\nOn our website we donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt bankers because we think we're helping somewhat I don't need you to do it you say the governments helping people out there not why do you need someone else to do it\nJust ... pop\nLike Spike Lee said to the right thing lives step up you won't once
