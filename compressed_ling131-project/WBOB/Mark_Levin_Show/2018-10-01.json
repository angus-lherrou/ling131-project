you are using some one on one\nLet me see if I understand Dr Ford has a score or to score of inconsistent\nStatements she's credible\nBut Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh said something about his drinking days that's inaccurate he's toast he's denied the Supreme Court glad that about right\nNow let's go through the prosecutors memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no science Elana\nCharge Dr Ford has not offered it consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred in July sixth tax to the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties\nEntered July thirty letter to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties her August seventh statement to the ... river said that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but she crossed out the word early for reason she done\nDid not explain it's just because the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consistent in order to get Kavanaugh\nSeptember sixteen Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties\nAugust seven early eighties but then crosses out early but September sixteen when she's being a lawyer in the summer Nineteen eighty two while she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\nSimilarly the September sixteen auto reported that notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privileged she has one of those records because she either gave them to or read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\nCommon for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow that timeframe\nDates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nNow let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say why he's credible no they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman early eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's my memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given in her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years to name her assailant\nDelayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive she writes she's nicer than I Am\n\nWhat speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testify but she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post but she and former husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same\nIncident Dr Ford has no memory\nOf key details or the night in question details that could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week\nThe memory to me it's quite selective specific details specific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh known details at all on cooperation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in what housley assault allegedly took place aware of that house was located with any specificity\nPerhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail raised a significant questions she told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and\nShe testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from childhood home she also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both\nBut you couldn't remember\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently accent accepting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did but that she called anyone else thereafter\nThat's convenient because then they can't look at phone records\nShe does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party and was taking no medication at that time of the alleged assault and I will continue this after the break\nBut as I said last week during the course of this questioning by the prosecutor was devastating\nAnd then we have the ex prejudicial analyst and a host to the money she doing what is she doing she's growing up\nI mean this doesn't mean anything to the American means everything\nEverything is if you stop once many of these more on after she testified said Kevin our son he comes up and he's not done then they tell you this woman's incompetent incompetent she's confident\n\nYou'll see one earnings go up we are and more\nYou know if you've done costs um squeaking toward marker [noise]\nYou'll easily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who capture Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a sold out arena [noise]\nThat monster we can't stop those types of noises\nBut we can quiet all the noise around finding the right talent you know to know what you were talking about all you're trying to do is fill rules for your company but instead you're being inundated with reps from job sites trying to sell you one size fits all products you don't need\nAnd your inbox is full of candidates you'd never even consider monster cuts through that noise we work with you to really understand your needs and address those needs with the right solutions no more\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... excuse me the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear that conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turned on the music\n[noise] her account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post's account of her therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted she told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom interlocutors Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys and additionally link Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward\nDr Ford lifted Patrick PJ ... as a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and under July sixth text to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander she did not lift legal and Kaiser even though they are good friends leave link Kaiser's presidents\nShould have been more memorable\nThan PJ ...\n\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\n\nDr Ford struggle to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nDoctor for cannot remember she showed a full or partially set of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists knows her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapists notes were provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony Dr Ford cannot recall whether she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed than anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July sixth\n\nShe does not remember if she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post ... account on July six Dr Ford set in her first what's a message to the post that she quote\nHad therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified she had reviewed a therapy notes before contacted opposed to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged incident but could not remember if she had a copy of these notes\nAnd she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded a copy of or therapists notes or had reviewed them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember\nA few months ago if she downloaded them from the Internet or if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school I Can't remember if a\nWhite drinking at night I don't remember I had three cans or six I don't remember at two or four and we're getting here calling me saying and it sort of big thing so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask him\nIs a little lie\nWhat does that evidence as they say more lies\nLadies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory is yeah this is an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now to put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in around you get the point\nIt makes no sense this was July sixth there wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes to the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privileged on these therapy notes Dr forwards explanation\n'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House Sally White House ... what are we supposed to do\nA lot of can't rely on\nThat trip where they actually asked by God\nBy the way I have another drink wait a minute not in a public Dr\nFord's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line of the Washington Post's was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote she did not contact the Senate\nBecause she claimed she quote did not know how to do that unquote it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could bang you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or asked one of the people on the beach who you've consulted apparently frequently uh millions of people contact the Senate every every year\nWe have our living surges go ahead and Google on the phone number for the Senate it's right there she did not contact the Senate didn't she did not explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not a senator\nStuck there for good and I remember she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as her grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral\nThese are all recent it would also been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nSays the prosecutor Dr forge description\nOf the physiological impact to the event raises question since the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder Pete GST the data the hearing was delayed because of that committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying but\nShe agreed during your testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia coasts\nMid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNo to that her attorneys refused a private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer\nIt therefore it's not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley has offered to send investigators the meter and California or wherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview\nWe pointed all these points up they're important she just that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\n\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed when she described the ... the psychological impact of the incident to the Washington Post use of the word contributed rather than cause suggests that other life events may contribute to her symptoms and one question on that point\nSaid that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault other word she wouldn't that to it\n\nAnd the prosecutor abs the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr forge attorneys are likely affect the doctor for the count and she attached a very detailed timetable\nOnce the lawyers and the Democrats got a hold of events I'll be right back\n[noise] month\nAfter the long summer your air conditioning and heat pump have

surrounding this plan reversal paints for the American people a hideous and disturbing portrait of the Arizona senator on friday flight told the Atlantic\nA left wing publication site that he insisted on the seventh FBI investigation and the judge Brett Kavanaugh because he was trying to save two institutions the Senate and the Supreme Court and I imagine that ladies and gentlemen\nHe's Abraham Lincoln of our time\nDuring this interview he also explain that he was deeply moved by Chris Coons please that's the ... a Democrat from Delaware and decided that it was up to him Jeff Flake to bring a little unity that stop our country from coming apart quote unquote a move that apparently brought Coons the tears\nTo follow up on his preening media tour flight shut up on sixty minutes with Coons
