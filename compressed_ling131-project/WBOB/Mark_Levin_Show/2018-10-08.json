hate NAFTA I never thought I'd see the day where it was done ... gone and replaced by something better than it actually helps the American worker and more good news\nIf you're working in America today you have a job even more good news if you want to three hundred and fifty thousand people that worked for Amazon guess what you just got a raise if you are below fifty dollars now you're going to be starting November first at Fifteen dollars Amazon saying you know what\nWe have to raise wages keep good people see where the economy is booming and you have more jobs than people to fill the jobs that means companies are good people they have to applicants\nFor\nJobs and if they're good applicants they're going to have to pay them\nSo I'm In favor of a fifty dollar minimum wage as you know but here's what's even better\nWhen you don't even have to have a mandated by the federal government when the market driven by Trump economics is so vibrant that companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep good people that is a great thing\nSo you think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or are going to work for Amazon and company continues to grow that just got a raise because of the Trump autonomy this just in half a plus for the air\nIt happens because wages are rising so now Amazon has to compete\nBut it's because wages are rising so now Amazon has to compete with other companies UPS FedEx whatever they have to compete and they have to pay\n\nAnd that's what Trump would make sense and that's how the rising tide lifts all boats so wages continue to thrive\nThis is great news is an amazing thing today and we finally got rid of NAFTA\nYou don't want when he was first going down Curtis Ellis is with us so we're going to bring him in Curtis Ellis a senior policy adviser with America First policies and you're going to go back to the NAFTA days\nI mean I remember this literally it was like Nineteen or the Clinton that got elected and then Gingrich came as like Ninety five and\nIt's big NAFTA thing was going on and it was going to be like the panacea and all these jobs are going to be great and and and you know we were going to be the service it kind of nonsense they were selling us and back then you know how many Republicans were fighting NAFTA like three\nLike Maine Trump and Pat Buchanan that's it and if you get snapped a you know what Curtis can attest to this if you were against NAFTA in\nThe nineties you weren't looked at as some kind of an economic Neanderthal like dumber than a boxer rocks like you couldn't see the future your mild\nMired in the Eighteen hundreds and you wanted to bring back plot Smiths or something the horse and buggy like you just couldn't get where they couldn't understand the global world economy and how the hemisphere works remember all that nonsense\nThey embarrassed you into submission\nAnd we said it was going to be a disaster and it was and now the president has changed and joining us now to break this whole thing down for us and tell us what the differences are and how great it is to do us up CIA us\nMexico Canada trade deal Curtis Ellis who has been fighting the battle with me\nFor for decades and he's joining us now Curtis it's like Christmas\nIn October\nIs it's a great day it's incredible we we we thought the NAFTA was here to stay but it's gone it's going to be gone now I tell you as Congress is going to pass this thing the Democrats they they may\nThe global corporations who I Believe in open borders Renault countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth for that or or any anything like a national legislature or national board or getting in the way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere and\nRape and pillage all over\nAll over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal\nEditorial page invented this lie that the Smoot Hawley the the terror fact of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\nLive live and and that has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and it was still pops up and you\nFind Republicans saying it you find Democrats saying it you find better or saying it in Texas you find every moron idiot who doesn't even understand\nEconomics but they know for sure but it all the the ... the great depression was caused by terrorists right\nThat's what caused the Smoot Hawley tariff act\nAnd that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete lie complete fabrication and no basis in truth whatsoever that is now the accepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks Donald Trump's\nFor standing up to China and putting tariffs and plays for defending American industry to say well don't you know that tariffs cause the great depression or something and how do you know that well I read it somewhere to you know where you're at it well everybody knows that\nCase closed and so that all happened as a result that all came out of the debate over NAFTA in Nineteen Ninety four thank you Al Gore\nAnother lie from the Democrats than welded by the Republicans at the wall Street Journal editorial page all\nThe Republicans I mean back then Curtis that Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich\nI mean Bill Clinton basically came along for the ride\nBeing rich and a Republican majority John changes they all drove it see people forget this I remember I remember the Republicans drove this and they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything was going to be fine and the wall street driven right they got big donations by Wall Street\nLower Manhattan or they have one focus and that's on the ownership class that's on if you are an owner things will be good for you because you make more money and they view workers as simply take commodity\nMoney and they view workers as simply\nA commodity the first thing I learned in economics ... one is you go into a junior in high school and they talk to you about diminishing resources and so and supply and demand and they say the number one biggest\nCost of businesses what labor labor\nLabor right I mean you learn that in a sophomore in high school so it never stops no Curtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers lay out like the top three or four changes\nAnd how they positively affect the Americans going from an AFC aid to\nUnited States Mexico candidate or us and say hey\n[noise] about the top uh is some of the top changes it increases the amount of a car\nOr that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters of a car to enter the United states duty free three quarters of that automobile must be made\nIn the United states it\nIncreases the amount of dairy products that the United states can sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York\nWisconsin and the northern tier in California a lot of dairy in California the number one dairy state America a we'll have a greater access not just to Canada\nOr to third countries because Canada under this agreement will reduce subsidies to the dairy products exports to third countries it subsidizes its access dairy production\nAnd a ... under cuts are prices in third countries are you there yes gun guy out\nThere I heard a click I wasn't sure [noise] and ah it in it it it increases protections for digital trade intellectual property rights\nAnd the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous nap there was no digital trade there was no Internet\nAh there was a and and what's happened over the last twenty five years is Canada put in all these crazy a protections in requirements and regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuff to Canadians on E. bay became virtually impossible\nSo a e commerce is now increase we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet\nAnd I'm a ... that we couldn't do before\nAnd I was told and I'm ... I'm Still trying to check this out there isn't an agreement there is a stipulation in this us MCA\nThat if Canada or Mexico enters a trade agreement with a non market economy and that means China right there and the biggest non market economy out there if they do all bets are off\nWe can withdraw from NAFTA we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country\nSo basically what this is you can't set up in Mexico or for Canada can't enter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be ... and then use NAFTA as a way to get this the subsidized goods into the United states right\nThat's what was happening on NAFTA and that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we pass TPP exactly the Chinese bike rather than shipping the good straight to the west they go to Mexico or they go to Canada and becomes part of that\nDeal right yeah well thanks yeah it is like you know the\n... the other huge thing about this since it's on a a step back for a minute and look at the big picture\nNAFTA was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas right first we bring together North America countries then we get kept to Central America free trade agreement and the next several is going to be the free trade area of the Americas\nFrom from tierra del sway go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone and then we saw with ... with TPP the Trans Pacific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well\nAnd see all of these things are part of the of the vision the grand vision of creating a border lists world and I am not exaggerating misses not some John birth society conspiracy tall right\nThis is the fact that Wall Street journal again they\nHave said on the record there shouldn't be a law\nOr they want to amend the constitution to add\nA this phrase there shall be no borders that is the dream of the global is of the global is corporations the fortune fifty the fortune five corporations they want no borders no nations\nThey don't want pesky things like Congress\nOr the president a ... making it difficult for them to do their thing anywhere on earth fine cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision\nBeen laid out before in front of Congress this is not a conspiracy [noise]\nThis new deal recognizes that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country and it is a privilege for people in other countries to sell\nTheir goods in America is not a right it is a privilege we ever right to make things under our laws\nA labor laws\nEnvironmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in the situations for making stuff in this country treat everybody right treat the workers' rights treat private property rights respected all\nAnd you can make things and do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country and your company is from another country it is a privilege to be allowed to sell stuff in this country not a right\nAbsolutely Curtis you summed it up better than anyone who we could have had a thank you for being with us I've only got twenty seconds so I got to change topics and asking for a yes or no answer says ... common or get confirmed\nSo full of hatred for Donald Trump that it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he votes against him\nWell where we differ on that he's going to vote no yeah it would be up\nSoon he wants to be lying in the New York times Washington Post or some kind of the Republican hero of our time and so he's going to write a book and the whole thing and make a lot of money he's going to vote no\nIt really comes down to Collins and Murkowski has only knows this this is no secret and I would be personally shocked if there is nothing in this report\nAnd columns voted no I just could not even see her getting on TV and trying to explain it because you never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit was a column like I Do I Love the following year because every time she speaks just like okay that makes sense even if you don't agree with her I don't think\nYou're right I don't think she'd have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start right\nAnd she has basically said unless something's surfaces you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if Collins the cells beliefs or she's going to vote yes yeah that\nLeaves Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and sinking the fate\nOf the last two years of the Trump Administration up to twenty twenty because it'll destroy the Republican Party as we know what I Can't get Trump voters out\nAnd you can anybody else if this guy goes down with no weapons now where if there's evidence that's different\nThan the angry with him but his layering so\nAll that is in her hands and I don't know how you take somebody down where there's no evidence and then you basically ... ward the Democrats have\nYes that I think is almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree will this show boating self promoting\nA heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency Dianne Feinstein sitting on this information simply because it made it for a more potent gotcha moment does that really is that behavior that the Republicans are going to condone I sure as heck hope not and\nI think I agree I think Mitch McConnell is the other\nA card in this decade Mitch McConnell has been absolutely ferocious about getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower courts he has made it his claws he has basically refused to put\nThrough a lot of other a senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been his priority and I think he's very smart to do it\nI think he's I mean the Republicans across the country should be applauding this because\nNothing more than the judicial branch needed to repair it more than that and I so I think it's incredibly important that he's doing that\nUm and I think he will get Murkowski and Collins in her room and promised them the moon\nPolitically or if they go along with this and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them for even wavering I mean whether you've got drunk in high school or not what we know now is Stephen Breyer was\nArrested for under age drinking that didn't seem to stop his confirmation and yes it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years\nHe has behaved with unbelievable dignity integrity a decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like this as an adult so on the other side of that ledger we have hundreds of opinions that people think so highly of\nThat they are frequently used as a reference point in ah other judgments and other arguments legal arguments this man deserves the place on the Supreme Court I really hope he gets there\nOkay we're with Louis ... she is a contributor to the newspaper the hill and also the hill on line and also Fox News she has a new column out called Trump's America First policy scores a big win with a new NAFTA deal also Liz I Love your new website I Love the light blue\nOh I Love it puts me in a good mood really I I have\nTo say it's a kind of thing that you know you put off doing for light years because it's just too much trouble but I appreciate that thank you know I like it it's\nClearly I also like I don't know if I can say this on the radio like just like to just give you a feedback was were were friends but I also love the way your name is at the top in what is a cold when you're writing it my son who was a script\nIf not for life script and it's very soft and it also matches the dress you have on that is on your thing it's the same light blue so it just works that's all\nThat led to and I appreciate that more than you know I Would I'm going to\nPass it on to my helper who basically pushes me to do everything that's constructive and pushed me to do that\nFor that yeah whoever does your website told them that John Frederick\nLoves well thank you\nBut thank you for having me on um I got to run\n\nBut thank you for having me on um I got to run but it's always fun to talk to you appreciate it\nHe wrote a book in two thousand eleven called death by China\nI mean I have the front and center on my bookshelf is a great book you've got to read it\nYou get at Amazon or anything else debts by China Peter Navarro hill a lay the whole thing out and he is joining us now live from the White House if you didn't have our senior economic policy advisor\nTo the president and assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing Peter you're my hero it's great to have you on that\nBut I appreciate the praying my friend or but you're you're doing the work out there getting the message out and the message this week uh was basically a great deal not just for America but North America the president is just an amazing guy because he\nActs and keep the promises that he makes sure that concept\nFor a politician any promise back in June twenty sixteen he would renegotiate NAFTA deal NAFTA\nIs now dead now have the U.S Mexico Canada agreement and it's great news for workers in manufacturing industries as well as farmers and innovators and we go through some of the some of the elements of it if you want\nBut yes top line is great for America\nLet me start with that I Want to get to the elements and as you know you know this well because he talked many times\nI hated NAFTA from day one\nI was one of the only Republicans rarely get opposition to it when it first came out and I always said that Ross Perot at the end of the day he was corking but he had that sucking Saturday at that now and that's exactly what happened so I never thought that was the day where it would go and so to me Sunday night was like Christmas but\nI Would say that the un on Wednesday or I so I just want you to spend two minutes on this and then we can get to the specifics of the deal I was in New York on Wednesday was at the president's alive press coverage and it was fascinating because somebody asked him\nAbout his negotiations there with Canada at one of the questions was prime minister Trudeau asked for me to you turn it down is that true and he said absolutely\nAnd then he said not only did I turn the meeting down I've instructed my trade team just stop negotiating with Canada they're not negotiating in good faith I don't\nAppreciate how they're going about this they don't understand the stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go into Mexico and maybe they'll come back to the table some other time but I said stop negotiating with them were done that was Wednesday\nSunday night you get a deal what happened\nWell or Ninety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework lay down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago we entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that hit all the high notes it hit the example of\nThe manufacturing space a strong domestic content in the cars with Bill nine that hit market access for agricultural products that hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which are pharmaceuticals\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum that we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like dairy and some dispute resolution mechanisms\nAre and I yeah I said this on the air on TV and radio yeah I was puzzled why was taken so long\nTo get to um agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day like in this to a boxing match were were a lot of punches I get thrown but at\nThe matches over now they're all three parties ways up their hands and and try them and I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA\n[noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept I Know right where with Peter Navarro hated I mean it is I'm telling you you know this better than I Am in NAFTA was a bad deal for America America China getting\nInto the WTO and two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress bad deal for America\nWill you'll be you'll be were two thousand election authority [noise]\nAm six hundred WB

I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president you tell you I I don't remember one of those George Bush Republican\nWell well Karl ... listen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond by trying to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's at your liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service they they're not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and saying to you\nHey Morocco bomb it was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now let me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat conservative ideal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne word deregulation\nBob how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all the regulator of ... Iraqi right 'cause I I'm I'm\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm rights too far to separate one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two\nUh tell me the commercial banks that went under because liberals site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always said I'm OK well explained to me what commercial banks want under as a result of a recession when\nHe'll he'll out all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and allowing\nCall no no I I we can't get past the first for me and you have a back and forth\nYou can't just bypass uncomfortable questions you said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now I what I'm trying to suggest you as the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you'd with knowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat while the last now in the coffee or right was under Bill Clinton and how it happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what happens is the the ensuing administration left and right who are bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nYeah but but the coral your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation that commercial back the these these skills some of the commercial and they are joining of the commercial investment banks was the cause of the recession then what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because\nMarshall banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there there's no answer to it so I listen I Can't go on to all day because it's it's a ... for the audience did that I'm just trying to make the point I appreciate your call but don't hang up and I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong I Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and presenting the facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happened\nAt all you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end of the eight year in power when everything fell apart just prior to Obama being elected All right\nCarl listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day\nWe we lost because we had we had a cheap money problem we had a bunch of G.

I made this point on Fox repeatedly that the gift of Donald Trump the greatest gift he's given us as conservatives\nHas been his ability to make the left show their butts to everyone else you just mailed to you when I got a I've been talking to you for everyone I used to host than a male and I know where you are you weren't read into this program six different ways from Sunday\nDonald from Frederick always am I right you always knew who the left was and we did too yeah but people who work for a living we don't do talk radio content all day like is what I Do not my job\nThey have jobs they don't have time to pay attention to people Donald Trump has out of these people\nThat is a great guy just tell you to one more thing as a great piece of the American thinker\nTo forgive me I Can't remember the author San us when it hits on your exact point Senate Democrats and Kaiser so safe\nAnd it makes the point that the greatest trick or the Democrats ever falls was making people believe that the evil embedded in their radical messages that didn't exist just fly Kaiser says it's a great the sun I gotta run always great to talk to you sorry I got to take a break up the budget you know from our savings and\nEvery time you go on line your Internet\nProvider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer experts recommend using a VP and the software I use called express VPN makes a super easy for anyone to stay private online these days I don't use the Internet\nWithout express VPN express VPN secures and makes anonymous your Internet through data encryption and hiding your IP address the app takes Ninety seconds to set up on your computer or phone skewed click a button\nAnd poof you are protected so if you want to protect yourself from hackers in spies visit expressed VPN dot com slash marks to get this special offer three months free one on one year package\nWe believe in a constitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to elect representatives and a representative democracy that are going to go vote for our values the fact that you can't do that lip sounds a whole lot like your problem not ours\nWe haven't had any problem getting tax cuts passed through because we believe in economic liberty fat a lot of problems slowing down the growth of government but we've had some victories not a lot but some and it's been hard work and people have to take votes\nAnd it's been hard work and people have to take votes but they don't want to take votes liberals they want to pass it all off on the court's why do they don't want to take votes because ladies and gentlemen think about this right\nWhy liberal elected representatives whether they're in the house of representatives of the United States Senate why do they not want to actually take votes and pass off all the hard stuff abortion gay marriage on to the courts why\n\nBecause folks where do you think taking a liberal vote on a national gay marriage referendum or abortion referendum in no matter\nWhere you stand where do you think that what do you think in in in the heartland of America that there's overwhelming popular opinion for abortion on demand out there across the heartland of America outside of say a Illinois Maryland New York and California\nI Would venture to say probably not but there are representatives and US Senators out there\nThey don't want to take those votes they're afraid of those votes they want to pass those votes off onto the courts and now that judicial avenue to legislate from the ... at least at the Supreme Court level and it's turning into circuits in the district court says well\nYou're starting to see the judicial avenue for legislation which was never in the constitution cut off\n\nYou want to trash judicial supremacy now now that you lost fine like I said welcome to the party man B. Y. O. B.\nWill take it that's not how it was ever supposed to work\nIt's your fault you are the ones that did this you are the ones that wanted black robe legislators to legislate from the bench not us\n\nAll right I got another one this is my seventh rule seven to keep save role as somebody you're probably getting that right I bet some mistake [noise] seven takeaway lesson learned from this cabinet confirmation\nBut let me take a call before I get this ... hold on while let's take a say Jim sorry guys may throw that on your but he's been holding for what gym in New Jersey Jim what are you got for us\nThere and I'm a huge fan ... a cast every day you're going to cost great great show thanks but I said I Know I don't ... the gray one will be passed to you\nMark is legit I I I I you know let me tell you something to either mark is a very humble guy and then he ... you opened it up so I'm going to give you know 'cause ... you talk about but Jim\nYou have not been led astray mark off the air is this great guys on the air and he hates it when you talk about 'em too but he is he is the most one of the most loyal friends I've ever had I Love him he's a good man he is the great one and you know what I'm honored but I'm telling you right now when mark decides to hang up his cleats whenever that may be\nThere will be no replacement I'm honored you like myself but um I Will always take a silver medal of them are but go ahead I was very nice you I appreciate your complement\nYou know problematic and listen you deserve it still is and this is my thought process it does feel good to ... you know it does feel good toy but here's the thing is that you know a lot of people I talked to we we we all don't trust the geo pay\nIf you see there there's a pattern here is to Supreme Court justices that the only one that they stood up for it that's what they want everything else they stood against straw\nBecause listen if there was a real show and he was training at real that wouldn't be as many Republicans are facing looking at it was a\nDemocrat or a handful of Republicans that are conservative and on his agenda they don't want him to succeed because the shrubs\nThere the money the money flow for the ... case for the grandkids do you think that McConnell wants this China stop you don't think it's affecting his wife's family businesses I mean this is this is a fight\nThat I'll be honest with you know when we see it in terms of whether or not the Republicans cotton out the way the Democratic machine comes out what fascia knock on doors it has commercials on TV I'm afraid that they're not going to do that\nAs well Jim ... uh but I don't I don't know about his wife businesses so I'm going to take a pass on that one but I Want to address some of the things you said okay one you're right about a lot of people not trusting the GOP and I am certainly and I know mark as well we are not\nWe never fallen after I'm a conservative I Am a registered Republican but I'm a conservative and when the GOP abandons our principles\nIs there you are absolutely right it is time for us to go get out there and get our activists friends and no post on their Facebook pages and call their offices and say felons ladies like on Obamacare remember\nIt was McCain God rest of the man so but it was McCain sunk Obamacare we add the votes he did the thumbs down it is up to us to hold them to account you're right\nBut having said that you have and I believe me brother I get your frustration I Am with you un I Will never worship golden calf politicians I don't give a damn if you put an R in front of your name you don't vote our way in a primary you'll never get my vote again and this story period full stop I'm with your brother\nGuy I'm just telling you that we live in a world of fallible human beings I'm not your preacher nothing like the I'm just saying we're all sinners\nThe GOP are screwed up mentally on government spending they say cannot get their heads out of their collective butts and cut spending I don't get it we're walking into bankruptcy but\nGiven a binary choice right now and that's what it is listen I Love it I I'm I'm really I'm a libertarian in my soul and I'd love to party and I loved it they fight but right now it is a binary choice and you're a binary choice is real\nYour binary choice is this a party of police state tyrants right now what Palmdale I'm Talking about the hill Democrats I'm not talking about the rank and file voters out there I'm Talking about the hill Democrats you're talking about a bunch of police state pirates\nWho did this Spygate disaster who spied on the president who tried to take down Kavanaugh who were trying to take your money take your business take your health care take your kids' education your choice right now is between that\nAnd Republicans who\nMay be sixty percent of the time it with you that choice to me is an obvious one but having said that\nYou find a good independent or libertarian out there who we think in wind hey man let's get behind them let's keep these people honest in a primary I have I wrote an entire pieces about this who knows maybe that will be part time for a third party in the future if they don't get their act together I'm just saying gym the options here are between\nBad an absolutely cataclysmic Lee ... horrific with a Democrat [laughter]\nThat makes sense and that's why it is so important for us to go out there\nAnd vote we cannot be other option is terrible it's like someone saying hey let's man I'm you're gonna die in a heart attack of eighty years I'm going to cut your head off with a chainsaw right now you're going to die either way so what do you think that the answer is obvious that Democrats are terrible they are awful\nThey did after what they pulled in Spygate non cabin on the answer here is obvious\nAfter what they pulled in Spygate no cabin or the answer here is obvious\nI hire three with you there and you don't have to sell it to me yeah you don't have to sell it to me one hundred percent\nOn anybody I see so I'm going to be out way out there with the fact that you say are odd cast the problem is I don't think he is going to be there to try and get a independent both turned so many Democrats\n[noise] now what one more thing do gym 'cause I got to take a break the ten ten ten folks rose you don't know what that means email pen of your friends called ten of your friends Facebook and and tweet to tell your friends and make sure they get the heck out there and they vote that's the that's your job you have to go out and do that but Jim just remember this\nThe more Republicans we can get elected again I Know they're not the answer to all our problems but I Know our problem is the Democrats right\nIf the more we get elected we can afford to lose a few rhinos and still hold the conservative majority the problem with this slim lead we have now in the Senate is we have to collectively kicks kiss the butts of unreliable people\nAnd we can't do that in the Senate we have to be able to let a few rhinos go and still hold on to the concert a great\nCall Jim unfortunately I've got to take a break 'em run up against time but folks as important as a pivotal election get out and vote bring ten friends again it's not always a choice between good and bad sometimes it's a choice between ... and really bad and this is one of those times get out and vote on the bunch you know went from article that we'll be right back\n[noise] much\nI've had my share of mechanics calling me saying well
