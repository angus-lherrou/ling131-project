with CBS Radio he's with the John predicts radio network across the globe and he's with us now in Egypt Edward great to have you thank you John Edward\nA give us your ears your take now my front pay are going to Saudi Arabia the Saudis changing the story for the third time\nNow the Saudis saying okay here's what happened so first we said that democracy Yogi left after an hour then we said we couldn't find the camera then we said we didn't know what happened to them\nThen we threatened America and other western democracies with retaliation if any sanctions were put on them\nThen we said we're going to raise the price of oil because they did nothing now they're saying well wait a minute it appears that he was murdered in our consulate ... but it was a a interrogation gone bad and it was robe and there was no transparency and ... knew nothing about it\nYou've got to be kidding me what do you make of this Edward\nVery ... part of it is probably true though man probably knew nothing about it because he's a very old and a son who's running the day after the kingdom I'm I'm a man\nI'm OK let's assume for a minute that he's a man are you\nAre you still there yes okay\nI think are Egyptian house don't want me to say anything bad about them um and I I I don't know what you can say really but uh\nAnd I I I don't know what you can say really but ah the geopolitical situation is much more important than the killing of one journalist um I I I'm a journalist so I of course if they killed me I Would be upset but\nA a lot of money writes on this um the wellbeing of millions of people ride on this if we had an international economic crisis so I think people should step back and say to themselves do we really want to have a crisis assuming that\nThese parties could set up a crisis and I I think they could\nUm and Saudi Arabia\nYou've had have different forces inside Saudi Arabia that are battling each other you have forces in the Gulf that are battling each other and forces inside the United states that are battling each other and a lot of parties are trying to take advantage of this and to score political points\nUp which is very dangerous I think\nTo hear me yes let's go to the\nSaudis situation when you said you\nHave a division there what is the division and now they're trying to save face because they changed your stories three times and now the story is laughable right so obviously they murdered this guy chopped them up into little pieces and carried them out in McDonalds bags or something\nBut when you speak of the division within the Saudis tell me a little more elaborate on that\nWell Mohammed bin Salman a king found man ... was not originally supposed to be crown prince\nOr his cousin Mohammed bin Nayef was supposed to be crown prince and there are a lot of forces inside the kingdom that would like to see him become crown prince including a lot of forces\nOr in the United states that don't like Mohammed bin Salman man and they're trying to score points with this I mean\nI guess it's normal uh assuming could she'll be what's killed we have no proof that he was killed we we're assuming he was\nA but once again a lot of the noise that's coming out on that it's coming out from the forces that oppose Mohammed bin Salman man the forces that I'm opposed President Trump because President Trump is aligned with Monica ... man and with with king sol man I'm\nAnd taken out little bags while he was still alive all this though alleged Edward this is a mess don't you agree\nYeah I Do I Do and yet as a journalist and I also listen to your um indignation I'm at six twenty six Fifteen [laughter] on the air and I was nodding in agreement with pretty much everything you said but\nI'm the implications of what is done about it are you know ah they they affect a lot of people maybe even everyone um and also as a journalist my reaction is\nNot to let something go by ... with people saying so many things that are not true I'm at and I'm not including you and not a buck or something\nCaught my eye I was looking at a daily brief article I don't even know who owns the Daily Beast these days not that we ever get to start with but at least it was tied with Newsweek at some point [noise]\nUm and an article by Kimberly Dozier for whom uh I I Would I I Know from a CBS she um was injured in Iraq\nAnd I took a long time to recover and I I don't want to criticize her or anything but anyway her story it's very interesting because she quotes David Ignatius the Washington Post\nEditorial it um if you want to call in that I don't know what we should call them really\nBut never mind calling him anything I Know he's Armenian and I'm Armenian to sell out I'll be nice to him and and not say anything bad\nHe mentions a Jamal ... ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nWhich I Know because I talked to him for repeatedly over the last ten years and all I have to do is listen to somebody's comment to tell you that they sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood which which is fine I don't\nPersonally have anything against people who sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood but I don't like the Muslim Brotherhood myself and I had people criticize me for being biased while that's a good biased I I think I I did that with pride a specially after what happened in the middle east and what happened in Egypt\nAnd which got ... covered by people like David Ignatius but anyway never mind that let's just go to quickly to what he said he calls the Muslim Brotherhood\nA secret underground fraternity that wanted to purge the Arab world of corruption and autocratic rule it saw as the legacy of western colonialism okay I mean that's a nice way of looking at it um but\nUh they've also tried to seize power in Arab countries going back I think it's as long ago was Nineteen forty eight\nThese power in Arab countries going back I think is as long ago was Nineteen forty eight or they kill the Egyptian prime minister of the time\nUm I think his name was across she ... she people remember that but anyway they've also gone on a rampage than burned the opera house here in Cairo 'em when they didn't get their way back in the Nineteen forties I guess also\nI'm and I'm all you have to do is look at how they tried to seize power or institutionalize their power\nAfter they won the election here in Egypt\nUm to see that they were trying to stay in power forever and I have a friend um from college who I must say works for something called the Arabia foundation which is\nI'm tied to Saudi Arabia and I personally have no ties to that foundation north to Saudi Arabia or take any money from either and all I Know of of Alisha happy is that he was a classmate of mine that prints then in Nineteen eighty one\nBut anyway he said it better than anyone could he said the Muslim Brotherhood believes in one man one vote one time and I think everybody out during the middle East that knows anything about them would say that that's true yes they believe in democracy one time you vote one time\nAnd you can't get rid of them ever ever again unless you have the military step in as we had here in Egypt which got totally miss covered by the American media\nBut just look at guys up the Muslim Brotherhood which is a Hamas\nHas been in power there since they seized power in two thousand and and I believe it was two thousand and then seven I Can't remember if I could have been two thousand and six but anyway\nThey have done everything possible to dislodge them and they're still they're still firing rockets into Israel and\nI mean you can argue that the Israelis fire at them that's true that's not the point though they were not elected they seized power and they refused to allow the Palestinian prime minister to come to Gaza\nThey refused to allow the European Union monitors to man the border posts\nAre and then they complain that the places under a blockade which is which is a perfectly legitimate if you consider the fact that they're not observing the um Israeli pullout agreement that was signed saying that you need European Union border\nMonitors in order to keep the border posts open but anyway uh it says uh getting back to David Ignatius he writes\nShowcase the quote was moving toward his mentor belief\nThat democracy and freedom where the Arabs best hope of purging the corruption and misrule he despised okay perhaps he despised corruption and Mitch role but he supported the Muslim Brotherhood which is of course not a reason to kidnap him and chop them up into little pieces if that's what happened and I'm not saying\nThat to defend the people who would chop them up and take them out in doggy bags or by\nUh the the Muslim Brotherhood I I'm looking at all the people making noise on Twitter about ... ... and three quarters of them belong to the Muslim Brotherhood or sympathize with it and they stand to gain a lot or if Mohammed bin Salman falls and not only that\nThey stand to gain someone who sympathizes with them in power in Saudi Arabia because the other crown prince who was in power are before he he took control in June of last year\nUm Mohammed bin Nayef from what I hear it's also sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood and also has good ties with Qatar which sympathizes with the Muslim Brotherhood so this is the problem here in the west is not in our interests to support people who support the Muslim Brotherhood because\nThey are trying to a point in a autocracies Islamic\nAutocracies or that will be there forever and to promote their rigid version of Islam and they say that about everybody else but their version is is just as Richard if not more so so I think people need to ask that question and I'm not hearing anyone say that in the media\nAnd especially watching David Ignatius\nWhite washed the Muslim Brotherhood in this article he wrote um it it makes me irate because the one thing I must say from here in the middle east from last thing I say the only thing I say is the Muslim Brotherhood is not good and people in the U.S\nHave supported it in the past I won't say the name of the president before President Trump who did so for the CIA director before President Trump who did so but I think the public should put their foot down and say we don't want anyone supporting this group\nThe Muslim Brotherhood is behind as you pointed out and really rainy and uh a lot of bad things that go on around the world and you're right oh you have to do is look to the Arab Spring in Egypt and\nWhat a mess that was now there are Muslim Brotherhood people that are elected in various situations are there to actually hold office in\nA democracy and various parliaments and so you just can't make believe they don't exist but I Do agree with you a hundred percent\nI'm not sure where Ignatius was going with this article I really don't even know what the purpose of it was because these are not our allies and they're not very helpful people so I agree with that and I'm getting a lot of Texas here in tweets about\nBasically you know look this guy was not a journalist and he was a columnist or this or that or I don't think it matters ever went to ... ... you did for a living what does matter that he was living in the United states it was the Saudis citizen he went into a\nConsole to get a piece of paper and like the Roach Motel he never came out you don't bother me about this said would the brazen manner in which it was executed\nI mean if they really wanted something like this they wanted this guy I think there were other ways they could do it but this was pretty brazen I mean we are their ally we have done lots of the Saudis I don't like the fact we're involved in the\nEnd of the civil war as you know I think we need to get out of that and I have since the first day a bomb and got us in\nBut it was very brazen and it was like basically you know we can do whatever we want because we made a deal with Trump\nAnd that's the way it appears to the world right now and there is no bigger Trump supporter in the country then the guy you're talking to right now I Believe I Am a true believer in the president and his America First policies and defend them virtually seven days a week\nAcross all sorts of platforms as you know I'll just hearing otherwise\nBut I don't think he can sweep this under the rug and simply say you know well it's just not a big deal people get\nKilled by governments all the time it shouldn't jeopardize anything I mean this is one of those high profile things that were that is beyond me that MPs allegedly would allow this to happen and sanction it and now we understand that they rogue general that might have been involved\nGetting more businesses to expand are getting more companies started\nThat that was eventually going to pay for the tax cuts themselves much like the Arthur Laffer tax cuts curve back in the Nineteen seventies under Reagan and early Nineteen eighties where he actually decrease taxes and revenues went up the debt went up\nBecause he was running out spend as Sylvia said at the time\nSo my question is in the short term debts gone up do you see that coming down as the economy continues to expand\nYeah yeah I mean and that's the only way it will come down is with economic growth right and so that again she failed to offer any account of how the Democrats would generate economic growth and their anti business\nIt hurt her responses last night were all about evil corporations one after the other right and so there's corporate overreach and the big 'cause we have to we have to fight to make sure the small business person gets represented better up in DC\nBut it that much different than being anti business into revenues are up four percent this year and Virginia's coffers are overflowing as well but spending is up eight percent\nAnd as I said debate last night right the tax cuts or a hundred and fifty billion this year\n[noise] and so if you grow at four percent that's paid for right about what's not paid for is to get the budget we had to plus up spending four hundred billion not a hundred and fifty million for the tax cuts for a hundred billion in spending none of which is paid for getting nine Senate Democrat votes\nBits of it is confusing the people that we have the house and the Senate and the White House we do\nBut in the Senate you need to get sixty votes for the budget and to get those nine votes we've lost up the military and yet\nOur budget with Paul Ryan last year we did twelve approach bills they were pretty good still spending way too much but one way better than what the Democrats have and so but the Democrats to talk about debt and deficit it it it it they're just living on another planet\nAnd I've got a couple of a Texas questions here one from Rob in Chesterfield who says please ask the congressmen how do we pay for making Internet available to everyone in rural areas\nYeah well that's we there are grants available I brought that had an FCC down to the district the first year I was and\nAnd uh we we got a grant in orange county they've got a super innovator solution that will be a model for the other counties Louis says building towers but that that is right it should be part of our infrastructure plan that the kids to drive to like Donald's\nOr to be able to do their homework ... that's not good that run information flow these days\nThat that is the technology of the future and we we have to get that done and so that\nWe need an infrastructure package that the Democrats did a trillion dollar infrastructure package rubber back ... years right and no shovel ready jobs nothing happened right and so that's not the way to go I I think under Trump he gets construction or he gets on time delivery and I think we can do that and have a great product coming up in the next two years\nWhen you say grants are you talking about the state federal government I mean who pay federal\nWe've got a federal grant for ah Orange County and died of working out the the fed scooped up the payment to orange since I've been writing letters on their behalf over the past month or to try and get the check because they're already under construction for rural broadband but it's good news\nStand from Richmond says if you get reelected heard of the Republican's plan on raining in spending\nYeah well that that's the million dollar question and you know my opponent a critique me last night but it contradicted yourself 'cause I did vote against the budget because of the overspending\nAnd so the the the way you rein in standing is send up representatives who represent you and who will not vote for budgets that are out of whack and so I I've been a strong advocate on that I voted I've taken the tough\nVotes I get in trouble with my leadership on that once in a while\nBut I I ran I deaths and deficits an economic growth together and so I I I'm On the budget committee I've fought hard for the spending side but we need more wraps who will hang in there with us and we always get outmaneuvered by the Democrats at the end of the day right in order at the end that Iraq right up to Christmas right when that budget gets produced right\nThat everyone wants to blow out of dodge and I've been on the show you know numerous times on how the process works and it it it's almost intentional\nCongressman you were outraged by spanberger in this quarter almost three to one are you going to be able to be financially competitive here in the final Twenty one days\nYeah if you would have told me I raised ... million dollars and a quarter\nI Would have been amazing and happy as can be and so we get our message out right if if she has five billion dollars or you know in the same things that are not true and that don't appeal to voters\nThat that can be overcome very easily all you have to tell the truth give a positive account of your results until we have plenty of money to get an accurate account of what people in the seventh district want\nA you know if we didn't have that money to unfortunately that is the problem right if you don't have the money to go up on TV cause that Democrats on the mainstream media as well you you won't get an accurate account of what happened in that debate last night from the mainstream media for example that got scanned you know the the papers and then watched the debate yourself\nAnd see if the reporting in the Richmond Times dispatch for the Washington Post is what you saw on that video\nAnd uh so it's tough being a Republican about all the policy we win a right of people just voted on policy we went outside you can\nSo both of us agree that you did very well last night\nWhen the ten\nSo both of us agree that you did very well last night in the debate I tell you one of the debate hands down again because I didn't think spanberger put together a message that had an eco he's into it\nWhy not more debates I mean where are you cap and dissidents single debate I don't understand that\nYou know we we didn't cap but we had one fall through I I Can't go into too much detail other than to say\nA as a moderator was fired and upset the second debate plant so we're we're working on that and a reporter was fired for probably doing news stories on a in a balanced way and so what\nThat is problematic so we're we're working on the details and we'll work through them I I haven't kept anything yet\nAnd I I did want to draw people's attention today to Politico article\nIt's on it's on political right now\nAt that frames the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda\nAs well as you can do right that's what I was talking about last night that political Politico article on line everybody gets to play but from my opponent and every Democrat nationwide and you can watch the debates see her go issue by issue by issue to all that money coming in she's trying to run as a moderate\nAnd hide from her positions at the Democrat positions are all their their her position on\nRight\nSame the same is on the website it on our own website\nAnd so it's fascinating to see the wind up above the Nancy Pelosi playbook and then my opponents strategy it's a one for one match\nI've only got a minute because you have to go so it gets too quick question with thirty second answers so is my radio debate which was debate number three is is that still in play\nYeah yeah everything's still in play and I think I Am late for my next interview John\nOr just just one quick answer sure\nOne thing you learned about Abigail Spanberger last night that you really liked one thing\nYeah sure where her dedication to the country working at the CIA and uh she's she's a mom in it by you know in my neighborhood area that the you know loves her kids and wants to serve the country and that that's a huge commitment anyone that's willing to follow that calling\nI commend for their service\nAll right we're all the time more information Dave Brat

from\nIt came from them those white slave owners\nAlthough Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\n\nThat for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press and freedom of speech was synonymous\n\nAnd they were promoting a republic they were promoting individual liberty they were promoting private property rights they were fighting the ...\nPositions in viewpoints\nThey were fighting them\nAlmost every day when you read a so-called news article ditch trashing\nOur country\nNow let's go back to the first sentence of this piece on bucks America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here\nBecause that senses telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses tell us\nWhy do people of color AKA non whites why are they flooding into America\nWhy are they leave in Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico in one country after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia even China\nWhy are all these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation\n\nA lack of promoting assimilation learning English learning American laws learning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all you came to United States to escape\nThat culture of your birthplace right isn't that what a refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white come to America and America you see is so racist as a country\n\nThat as Brock Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four\nWhite people will be in the minority\n\nThere so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist that's why\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check\nIt destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit which is exactly why the left pushes so let's go back to the story\nAmerica has a massive growing racial wealth gap now for the left of course that means more government more redistribution of higher taxes more regular you know in more and more and more to government\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black family\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to get lower income kids kids\nA sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they call them opportunity accounts they don't call these Marxist accounts they call them opportunity accounts [noise] what theoretically no this is the article is just a news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\n\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grow up in wealthier homes\n\nSounds cool right equality\nIt would be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bookers set an interview with Fox we can rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from\nNever nobody cares\nWhat kind of taxes for it to be increased who cares\nWhat kind of additional debt will have to be accumulate who cares none of it matters we're talking about the quality of results economic equality we're not talking about liberty\nDon't confuse us with liberty don't confuse us what markets don't confuse us with opportunity no don't you see\nWe have a racist country we need to take money\nGive it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class or see\nSimple\nOne and I think of this why didn't anybody think of this these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era the modern modern era\nI guess economics\nDon't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe needed opportunity account of the fifty thousand dollars a kid what's the big deal at ... at it free college\nAt ... at it for your health care and while we're at it open borders\nAnd while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd why were added why don't you destroy the country\nWhere the richest country in the face of the earth or even our poor people live better than most poor people in the rest of the world they don't have local state and federal welfare systems\nFood systems\nHousing benefits they don't have them in these other countries we have him in this country thanks to the productivity of individuals who get up every morning and go to work and come back in the evening\nAnd contribute to society\nWhy do we spend all our time attacking the people who create wealth who create this

got a second ago you're right it's an investigation my mind the big point is you know it's not over yet the information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis they've got a nice guy the the really bad guy they do a lot of bad stuff and wave going what do you keep the little guys\n... whether to keep defending those guys despise those guys\nHe said he did but I don't think he's just sending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last the period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered\nDon't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with that situation\nWell you you you know have already come out several times he came out with a rogue excused early on\nThat left so that's all wrong you know you have no evidence yet okay let me thought for all\nWhy are we so focused on this\nBecause it's important it's about truth about\nHonestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United\nStates it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\n[noise] but you know the media and the ... supported that deal Obama supported\nThat deal that is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was Florida and in a horrific way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why are the coverage [noise] is is is so massive and neither do you\nObject looking for for a period okay\nAnd I don't hear a great man no matter what they say All right thank you sir the truth is the Saudis murdered them\nThat\nWe know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of it is certainly the crown prince in my view how the hell are they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand ... and I believe one of his intelligence guy senses top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about\nThat is no there's no doubt about it\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know but\nWhat are you what the president to do\nHe says that they're going to be some fear that a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military so\nSo what else do you want him to do I'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post is all worked up about this and so or other media outlets I got I understand it and I understand that people are upset about it I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that I'm Talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world but at least deserves some attention\n\nI don't know that they'll ever get to the bottom of this hopefully they will\n\nI'll be right back [noise] much\nHey I'm Brandt so there's
