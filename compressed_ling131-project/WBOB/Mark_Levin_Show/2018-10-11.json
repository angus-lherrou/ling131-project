sense about outsourcing our jobs and just remember the black Democrats will say this about you is what happens when they grow don't read\nThere it is [noise]\nThat's what happens when Kanye West's was ripping on George Bush after Hurricane Katrina this guy was brilliant\nSo revolutionary mine of the black community this guy was unbelievable he was he was the law but the Democrats like because he was a powerful black man with a lot of talent who was challenging a white president United States of America who clearly doesn't like black people\nBut now oh now you're just to buy new that didn't read\nNow you're just to buy new that didn't read\nKanye West\nMet with Trump in the oval office he also talked about his childhood and when he was growing up now again this is the ... there's the new line is the president is taking advantage of a mentally ill black man\nAnd exporting that black man as a token black man of his racist White House that's the new line that we've seen come out in the last half hour\nKanye West as a black man that can't thing for himself\nAnd and clearly the only reason why it's thing for himself was because he has a mental issue and so then the ... the United states of America is abusing this black man and I guess the Democrats saying we need to bring you back to the plantation to the mental hospital right that's what we got to do\nThat helps you to\n\nYou know my I I Love it he said that he goes he's talking about as mad as make America great again hat he's at my own friends tried to bully me people to come after me they attacked me they threaten me\nAnd in a way it gives me power where the ... of course now that definitely means that he is a negro the day that can't read or doesn't read I guess since that 'cause it's even more insulting if you say the nigger that doesn't really tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read there it is yes yes that's what it is\nHe talks about that how he explains that he likes wearing the make America great again hats he understands in America it should be something we should be proud of that we should stand up for that African American job unemployment rates all the time was or a good thing and then what the last administration was doing was clearly not working\nBut Donald Trump now what a what a terrible person he is exporting\nThis man he is exporting him he is exporting him and

this kid\nA things on it a lot on his medicine or that it's horrible he's going against the African Americans um he can't get a break uh it's\nJust it's despicable what to do with the guy now because it's a Trump fan and it's it's horrible but these people do it\nThis is this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well I mean you you look at the last week you bet to celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift who comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate\nIn Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she what she would do if she got elected to the U.S Senate and Democrats came out and said this is a\nBrave independent woman they threw down the woman card right this is what does that brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should or should have should look at her and teach your children\nAnd your daughters and your and your grandkids to be like Taylor foot because this is what a strong brave role model of a woman looks like\nThen ... west comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they say it out and it's it's really really bad I mean it's on believable each like they want to put in that they want to institutionalize the guy now right\nNow they they want to kidnap him and they want to bring it back to the to the plantation at the Democratic party and then lock him up in solitary confinement and their mental ward so they can control the black man because right now they can't control I mean when they can't control a black man who's who's speaking truth to the world they'll tell you they'll undermined\nYou and say you're mentally insane [noise] you're mentally insane [noise] God Bless you good to talk to my friend been burgers and filling in for Marco event and a lot more

institution that has its roots in slavery\nAnd by the way the Democratic party has its roots in slavery so\nI'm just curious are we going to eliminate the Democratic party as well because the Democratic party has its roots in slavery but this is a woman that literally claims electoral college is an institution that we should abolished because it has its roots in slavery just like the party that she's a part of and this is also a woman\nWho came out and said that she is going to be integrated [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'm waiting for a Democrat to say this is what happens when you

the conscious which would be God they don't care what the law if the people that's the case going by killing so\nWhy don't we moved here which went up to the um\nWhatever that means you've got to skate through\nAll the Democrats don't want to say\nWell it was real it was wrong it was unscripted and and and I you know we're we're the Democrats by the way last week saying that NBC a and inside why the terrible thing by putting a mentally unfit man on their TV show exporting his popularity\nOr there were there were nowhere to be found were they last week nowhere to be found\nMe last week was the week that they should have been out there saying how dare you take advantage of Kanye NBC Saturday Night live how dare you put him on stage and his mental state 'cause that's what\nThey're saying today I didn't see anybody at NBC News saying this is what happens when it when it when a negro doesn't really sick um on Saturday Night live Saturday Night live I tell you that's what happens\nYou know you you this is this is what you need to understand this is you know you're an educated ignorance fool\nTell you what's his what happened when they grow don't read there it is\n\nYou just don't read you don't agree with us we will try to destroy your life and say you need to be in a mental hospital ed you're on the mark of an show in Ferguson when you go ahead\nMan this is ed from Minnesota just south of the city's listen as an African American I'm really really just disgusted by what the Democrats did but\nI shouldn't be surprised because this is the play book [noise] see I like Tania used to be you know democratic a party believer until I fell off the Democratic plantation just probably three years ago\nGee it's we don't think in the black community like they want us to think when all the time were sellout\nWere or whatever they want to call us we don't think we can't read\nBut I can read and I understand I understand exactly what's going on what's going on here is when we don't do what they say they will do whatever they can to be little else to destroy us to try to uh to make whatever it is that we have to say\nAnd and make it small I support the president I like what he's doing I liked the fact that the African American unemployment is as low as it's ever been pretty much I like the fact that we have jobs in our community the nation is driving\nAnd I don't like what the Democrats are so\n...\nWhere I work at the Democrats I'm like what are they selling and and I did it I didn't talk about this the other day\nUm with some college kids and I said All right what is it the Democratic party can run on this time ... ... they they can't run on the economy being bad right because they're using the party of doom and gloom they can't run on health care\nThey can't run on unemployment they can't run on on race or an African Americans being left behind or Hispanics being left behind so they have to make it personal\nAnd the way you make it personal is anyone that you don't like you turn them into a racist or a gang rape is Brett Kavanaugh\nYou you turn them into a mental a ... a mentally insane person Kanye West you you turn Donald Trump into some sort of unhinged individual that out of control and can't be trusted with nuclear codes or the economy but you can't say economy anymore because the economy's killing it\nAnd so what you do is the only thing you can run on this time\nBecause you can't fear monger right it's hard to fear mongering country into saying you must smoke for us because we're gonna make the economy better that doesn't work the economy's killing it right now and everybody knows it you can't you so so the only thing you do is you have to undermine the legitimacy of the person\nYou have to undermine the legitimacy of Marsha Blackburn intent in Tennessee by the way the Taylor Swift it you know she terrifies me I cannot imagine thought\nA it scares me and makes me want to get in a fetal position because she couldn't attack on the issue so you have to attack or on the I'm I'm afraid of view\nYou attack the president the same way you say that well the president's really not in charge of this country the Russians and they concluded together and we're going to sell that until we can't sell anymore anymore and this man needs to be impeached and then you do the same thing with Tanya and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh\nThis man needs to be at peace and then you do the same thing with Kenya and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court so you scream and yell and you'd throw things at center at home then you surround them at dinner and you and you looked like an angry mob and then you say it's ... it's it's unfair to call it the mob that we are not an angry mob\nThat you are an angry mob and you are\nA scary person and I should be afraid of you and everybody else should be afraid of you that that's what they're running on their running on personal attacks and emotion because there's not a single issue\nThat that the Democratic party can right on right now that they can win on you I mean the main core issues you can't tell us we're in an unjust war and innocent people are dying and we need to come home because we're not in a big war right\nRight right he had that for ... for years that they ran on you know you want to get to that you want to stop spending all this tax money Iraq Afghanistan you want to get kids a good education and you want to stop spending money on defense and start saying these poor boys over to be killed in these women to be killed and senseless wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're absolutely right\nThat the playbook is make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's around here like\nWhat do you like what can you start interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially the African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I\nWell Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control the Senate if it wasn't for them overplay their hand with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're furious and they realize it another four years of Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party is we know it because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have well when in point in numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified but what what I Would say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive\nAnd I think the Brett Kavanaugh is what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans say that character assassination that character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and when there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSay the child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapist\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about\nIt it was about honesty wasn't about fairness it was about a true investigation wasn't it was about trying to destroy it man keep them off the Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played

threats have had people that come after me and my family um that is the intolerant and left\nThey will come after you with everything they have a and and and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore what are they gonna do Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat are they going to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying every\nDay every day it was something else while he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rate so then he was he was involved and gang ripe breeding game right me but he was playing the parties that gang raped me well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college I think the game right people in college\nI actually saw me we didn't actually solves me but he might have been the room when other sexually assaulted me\nUp for ... for somebody like Brett Kavanaugh he was the perfect gentleman I mean this book is probably the best of America them claim of a person over I'll bet on a high school or college in Ireland\nI don't think he would say and I think he was probably a jock\nWho was the captain of teams who drink and party with his friends and that doesn't mean that you're a rapist yeah you know and and and today it was interesting 'cause on the view today they were having a conversation about this and you want to talk about mob mentality\nUh and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality Abby Huntsman\nOr was defending Maloney as me to comment saying call for evidence and and the view show exploded around her\nMillennia Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know in this exclusive interview with ABC News that she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have a really hard evidence\nThat if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said the media goes too far and away they portray story that's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia\nWell you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny house then took a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady is telling women everywhere your word is not enough um that's that's not true I mean it's\nI Can't support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to a level of accountability that our court system says is that is adequate and correct that you must have\nEvidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid his parents are now suing a five high school students who uh falsely accused their son of sexually assaulting them\nDestroyed his wife destroyed his friendships destroyed his entire life they everybody's walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\nThere are people you know there was this or a football player recently there was a ... a film I think it was on HBO done about him\nHe went went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of raping a girl and it came out that finally that he didn't labor\n\nWe should believe in the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob but the mob mentality of the left is if you are a woman you must be believe no matter what and the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he proves his innocence if that's not a mob mentality I don't know what is\n\nYou can go out there and and accuse somebody of doing I mean Abby Huntsman said today evidence should always matter\n\nEvidence should always matter\nI had no problem with saying to Mrs Ford I had a problem with her story when that didn't\nAdd up take emotion out of it\nThe reason why I didn't believe Mrs Ford is because she got to hand pick the people that were in the house\nIn the room\nAnd people said the president was mocking Mrs forwarded that campaign rally when you know she said to you know Brett Kavanaugh you know tried to ... murder me and raped me remember that\nWhat you were to happen I don't know\nWhere to happen I don't know how did you get there I Can't remember how do you leave I don't know you tell anybody know\n\nMillennia Trump said exactly what ever and this is where I Believe the midterms are going to backfire on the Democrats I Do I really do believe that there are too many mothers out there that have sons that have husbands that have nephews that have dads\nAnd they saw what they did that Brett Kavanaugh based on a political assaults and nothing else and the assault is still going\n\nThe salt is still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put us in charge of houses or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nNot based on facts based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else to run on so let's turn every Republican into a racist or sexist sexual assault individual turn them into a gang rape is that's what you gotta do to turn\nThem into that turn them into that\nOne eight seven seven
