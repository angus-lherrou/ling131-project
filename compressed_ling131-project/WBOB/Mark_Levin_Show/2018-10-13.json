about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done a ... piece from the specter that put in context our wall of the United nations has been on the climate prediction every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest a decent person you are wrong if you work ... to ... for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies while was it it was the big global cooling and the ice age right\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another ice age\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story the queen world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it was like oh crap well that's not working out\nSo then it became one in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remembered how every aerosol can every little buffer that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere on the way are like oh you know what the sun actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort of this world towards eliminating it would probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those holes [laughter]\nFunny thing is sunspots you know [noise] huh [noise] so that went away and then what did it become close global warming and we got global warming preventing year trying and then ...\nNot buying it to go from global cooling we\nGo from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel is something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events oh remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur watch what do you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is the Peter crowd to really think about this for a moment if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the ... or do you care about uh you know your your climate change their begin to get you we're more cows who's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this so anyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of Dinah flatulence and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a match\nTo extinction events ... it'll be just you

that she had just turned Eighteen and she said you know I can now\nAnd I said I Am so glad to hear a young person saying that she said well it was kind of scary at school today\nBecause one of the gals there is a guidance counselor now this is a person of authority that this high school\nOut here and told her all I Need is your sense of security number and I can register to vote [noise] really

will will will have the doctor come out and see right away it's their voter registration forms\nAnd the people just going oh okay and they're feeling about this I don't know\nSo it's usually the mind boggling\nYeah here's my question is they're not an obligation by the folks that are citing you up to tell you or is it just a case that you just are supposed to read whatever you saw\nA yeah I mean there's there's nothing in the law that says you ... I guess because they didn't really believe that people could be bad compliant ah ... there's nothing in law that says oh by the way this is a voter registration form I I you know I mean it it's bizarre but\nProbably I appreciate an update if you do decide to call them all and if you if I Want\nTo know what gives us something in the right to think she can fill out the form for\nAn Eighteen year old right and on his lately a kick because you and I both know that the kid filled it out herself and check the little are box it would have gone in the garbage\nProbably maybe there and let me ask you this uh you you have my of course you are my number text me over the name of the school and um and if you follow up and don't get a a good answer I'd like to uh make a call before next week show yeah absolutely thanks on say a great high by miss you um\nWhat a ground great great call and I ... and her husband to she's not in that kind of way though don't\nBe like yeah okay okay okay I got a guy things I Know I I Know that's true and I thought it was all we know [laughter]\nHa ha ha trust\nMe she will stock you find you [laughter] and she has a plethora that means a lot of weapons\nThat she does and then she says she knew like upside rounded tonight she may not the practice [laughter] so it's an inch in as his GED accurate yeah it was well armed she's uh she's the closest thing\nTo a modern day any ugly you will find around um oh what is\nA chick fillet a straw that's it [laughter]\nWhich is a felony in California now by the way that is one of the draw yeah they won't buster for possessing a firearm but they'll give you a felony for having apply also\nHave outlawed plastic in California how come they still have the Dianne Feinstein\nKnew that was I was\nSpeaking of that the voting today yeah yeah\nI watched a democratic senator mhm because she voted no and her colleague from the same state was Republican and was going to vote by mhm she withdrew her vote\nA is at least some of the ... ... ah mccaskey so\nWho knows that she ... she had a hyphenated name oh ... which is legal yeah and then watched President Pence said yes it doesn't change the outcome of the boat so terrifically legal or and it just took it down to a fifty\nFive and forty eight so we knew we now have a new Supreme Court just yes we do um we had a big discussion on this last week and I'm going to continue that discussion with my next guest\nAbout the the late in the hour by which bubbles um bubbles yes I'll forward Dr Ford ... I'm sure that she had to get a nickname bubbles I did not know that lazy for um\n... you know she the ... I did I my question is I'm stuttering through my words\nHow how offended how sexually assaulted how expended war you if you didn't make a police report you didn't tell an adult didn't tell an instructor didn't go to the hospital and then you wait at thirty five years and send it were yeah and then\nYeah yeah and then you top it off by by naming specifically naming four witnesses who all of whom said no way that I wasn't there I don't know anything about it this is nonsense I ... the whole thing is\nUnbelievable in that boat cruise just how far these Democrats were willing to go to to to get their way that the ... the old you know the ...\nJust she's a she's a doctorate of psychotherapy yeah yeah I think what they meant to say is she needs to see a doctor\nIs around it it sounds more and more like that is exactly the case although I Know I'm going to get myself in trouble with this but I was a nurse and the way back when you were\nAnd now a ...\nWhen you were ... and now a mirror every day but it ... ... ... these people that were in these you you see all these interns coming through for psychology they were crazy and they were they were they were they were in that field or\nMaybe they were looking for a cure and I look at a rare honestly honestly they kind of looking for that self awareness kind of things I mean yeah yeah well\nAnyway I think that it has I think the the last Ninety Days Ninety Days is\nIs an incredibly long times seven different FBI background checks yeah\nUm it's amazing it reminds you those seven background checks just trying to find stuff and trying to find so I'm trying to find some reminds me of the four votes that you already see took trying to get that ballot you carry\nA the ... floor of a say did not take one more year it was too okay he wants to to real votes and to ... well anyway that was the discussion about the cat lets move on yeah I mean hey I'm Duvall GOP dot com design GOP dot com okay that's where you buy you sounds like a oh\nTickets for that yes All right we'll be talking about it over the next couple of weeks but I've got this little newspaper here yes there was apparently put out by you because it has a letter from you yes in here with the official CEO\nOf the Republican Party of Duval county and hum it talks about the amendments that that are good for us I'm Glad that you're not approving three\nUm I don't I'm not surprised that you're not approving for a because that would just put a a great deal more Democrats on the voting rolls a nine\nYeah kind of iffy about nine and ten so are you going to be putting together a list um maybe\nOn the R E C Web page or something that attack certainly I I actually all four of these pages what he's talking about is the official voter guide from the Republican Party do accounting kind of like a large version of currents quick fix\nYou know what it is and a matter of fact somebody wondering what are we to call it the Republican quick fix I'm like oh maybe it's too soon\nBut yes it never to say to correct it tells you um are candidates it goes through the amendments and those that were endorsed by the Republican Party of Florida and then and we do a nice little comparison um regarding Andrew\nGillum socialism versus a round the center of capital to invite him so ... there's a really good comparison ... there's some there's an interesting article this three articles lifted as well that show you exactly what's going on as far as the gun control\nA and and I'm not his Gillum cozying up with the sheriff Israel down in Broward County bladder guy\nI had a question for a long time listeners someone who calls your show also wanted to know is there a way to find out how many of these candidates that the Republican Party is promoting are represented by the same consulting from\n... in that grouping you won't find many\nReally they're all from different for our grids all around\nThe world pretty much from that grouping you won't find a lot of them for for November of twenty Eighteen you won't find a lot of them\nGood deal you're listening to I'm speaking plenty I'm your host bill hey I've I'm waiting for my second guessed command so Karen may be here may not be here when we get back well we'll go over everything she had to give force today as far as the Lincoln day benefit and we'll be right back [noise]\nIdentified even with the gender\nExactly yeah and in fact there's one state now in our country that is a not requiring the sex of a baby I think it's a New York ... is not requiring the sex of newborns to be placed on the birth certificate [noise] it can be left as as a circle\nWhich many people are now fighting the fact that it can be left as a circle because it stands for ... and it could mean other\nOh my gosh so should a male female each other\nA motor yeah we're all other so so here's here's my question for you and in here's here's my hypothesis we're going to do this like the like the scientific method like I'm going to generate a hypothesis and that hypothesis goes back several centuries many centuries ...\nAnd and then we're going to bring that forward based on discussions that I've had with several people including two women at the airport yesterday\nUm that women have been\nA major part in the downfall of our society and our culture over the last Seventy five years\nBecause and I'm going back centuries because over a period of time we allow more and more I'm active participation in roles that were generally\nMale oriented\nI don't really see that these women who are causing all these issues are in these male oriented rules they are as you said young progressive who who who are not in any role there just being let around by the nose basically being told what to say that they're being\nOr not in any role there just being led around by the nose basically being told what to say that they're being spoon fed this garbage is going in their heads and they have they're not old enough and have enough experience to figure it out but that doesn't\nMake a go deeper than that they're being led around there being spoon fed right and they're being listened to\nAnd that would be too by the media who wants to push that same agenda right and so he really didn't listen to them right if we didn't put a microphone and ... and ... we might have some opportunity right and stealing I touched on this last week about World War two\nAnd all the men being sent away to war and women running the rabbits and welding well actually welding didn't really start until the end of World War two buff\nBut running all the robots doing welding building the aircraft building the ammunition now um\nAnd and there's some really funky things that I Know about women didn't get paid\nThey got paid but their money was withheld and given to their parents or put in an account he married\nUntil their husband came home and if their husband didn't come home then they could apply and show his death certificate or the little note that you're getting from the military service that said your husband was in Iran\nAnd the telegram yeah and then they would if they were under the age of twenty five then the money that was in the account would be given to your legal guardian which was your parents your mom or your dad my things or had reason to give it see that's the thing God\nI Know you guys cringe about yeah yeah but there was a time in this country when our country Rand better when women stayed at home\nWell they stayed at home and they still are probably pretty much ran the world anyway but um but but from behind the scenes\nAnd I agree with you know a lot of times there is something to be said and I had a I had a no less than three our conversation with a woman\nIn North Carolina a woman spoke to you for three hours while women always speak for three hours no women always speak for three hours of the main thing is I was able to get a word in edgewise oh so that is the the we were in North Carolina I was doing work with the helicopter doing storm helping out which by the way is an incredibly\nIncredibly satisfy thing and then if you're up on my Facebook page eventual you're going to see\nA lot of videos or some of the ... that we went to and some of the things that we did while we were there\nAnd just absolutely amazing and satisfying thing when when an eighty nine year old woman comes out and gives you this huge hug because you brought her a case of water yeah yeah but you know just and it wasn't even a huge it wasn't even the Evian sparkling water it was like a Walmart brand water whatever they may and uh yeah\nAnd so when you're there that's right I guess that's a conversation we're going forward with is the fact that when women were the nurtures and the ... took care of the home to carry the kids and the fathers were the hunter gatherers and provided the structure and the discipline in the home mhm\nWe didn't have the kind of run away crime problems that we have today and we didn't have to kind of inflationary actions that we have today and now we've got women\nHaving their own income men having their own income shared incomes

talk to caring about the voter guy Hi Paul care\nOn that show that got the voter's guide I wanted to thank you for that because you did an excellent job of explaining the ballot amendment ...\nThe language that you wrote demand is much easier to read the ballot so [laughter] yeah which I which on the ballot if it's sort of vague and a legal with that but you did a great job of explaining one\nHowever I Want to ask you what happened to men number because that's missing from the ballot\nIt is amendment aid is the um it dealt primarily with a couple of issues that dealt with the um a requirement that all school boards throughout Florida would have term limits and it also dealt with allowing charter schools to\nWho may not be able to get approved in certain counties um to have a secondary process to to to get their licensing and and to start another some some some ... county school boards won't\nJust will not allow charter schools to exist and so they gave them a second route to open and uh the teachers' unions in a couple of other groups took it to court and the court threw it out\nAll right so that's why she from the ballot ask why it's\nOkay uh I don't know why I I'm afraid that I'm In the governor's race I'm afraid that bill is going to win guilt by like\nI say this and that is running a very weak campaign he has an arsenal of ammunition that he could be using a good deal of them are right now such as the forty percent increase in the corporate tax\nAn income tax Rick spanned to medicate sanctuary cities like\nRepealing stand your ground and then he club I don't hear this and it's heading a bomb on any of those issues and the way it's sad it's TV ad that I saw something to do with this and it's played little league baseball back in Nineteen Ninety One\nYeah well that I heard you know I remember him though is that right is I'm Sorry again I heard he got a new campaign to yeah he has um actually he does have a new campaign team and it's now being let 'em led by a Suzie wiles\nWho has a um she's the queen maker she she's yeah she's got a lot of the queen of the kingmaker and she was involved in getting Rick Scott elected 'em both both times for governor a internally gonna see I\nDidn't and she was I was very involved with the Trump campaign and was the co chair for the Trump campaign for Florida yeah so she's got a a a ... a huge volume of of of knowledge and experience that you know with her and so I think you're going to see some changes the other thing that that people kind of\nYou know when you're not in politics all the time you don't always think about it but those of us who watch politics are always looking where's that yard sign where's that ad oh my gosh oh my gosh and yet for the great majority of people I mean literally Ninety percent of the people who will eventually vote\nDon't aren't paying any attention in till somewhere between two to three weeks you exactly exactly and so what they do is they save up all of their time they buy ahead of time they by media um ... uh uh times than just the way ahead of time but they they load up\nSo that it starts hitting and you just hear boom boom boom they just pound message pound the message pounded message but they wait until people are listening\nBut you know we all know there are male victims they are the victims\nMy issue is my issue is thinking\nThat their mail and there are victims because if they're if they're victims and their men you'll never hear\nWell okay see ... from your perspective yes the real man sorry oh man I'm a I'm not going to go back to his wife\n\nPromotion nobody high\nThen wait a second I think that's totally into there are plenty of men who believe that they are entitled right to certain things particularly from our government loans so I disagree with that completely\nThere are plenty of males out there who may decide that they are not\nThey're not in our measurements\nLifetimes ration though is that we've had this victim hood mentality and it's just overwhelming now and it's over oil right way and it wasn't as prevalent and now we're constantly bombarded by it and that's why I'm so into entrepreneurship\nBecause entrepreneurship is the way to get people to have the dignity of work\nBy understand and I liked that segue and there but it's a segue with a interesting premise\nBecause the programs\nThat we have for inner city youth and some of the other programs that are available for\nWomen's infants and children and snap snow Supplemental Nutrition programs and uh so we can carry home food because mom and dad didn't want to get off the couch with cousin ... and go out and get a job and get some canned goods in the in the pantry\nThose programs are enabling an entire generation of people to sit on their front porch with\nTheir hands out there also enabling the government to run more of their lives\nExactly so what do we give up first did we lose a generation of people which is the way I think we should go in fact about two generations I think anybody that is\nAge six or older currently\nIs lost in in various demographics around our country\nYou know and you can tell me if you want but you take a little six year old African American kid and you take it a six year old ... Caucasian kid and a and a and a six year old Puerto Rican kid or Latin American kid or whatever you put 'em on the playground\nThey have no care in this world what color you are they only care if you can push 'em on the swings or if you've got a robot kick ball or if you can shoot baskets or whatever\nThat's all they care about racism and division is is taught in the home\nAnd in the school and in this school is okay it have ice in the school you very unfortunately but I just\nWant to point out that at six they're not lost now they've lost a ton of ground but can we still recovered them at age six shall we can and I want to point out a really exciting thing that I heard from one of my entrepreneur teachers this week she opened up at first post\nHigh school which is a tough tough neighborhood\nIs that the former Nathan be forced high school\nI Know isn't that on the west side you know I'm Still learning my way around it I think worse now or is it now is on the side ... around it All right first coast is north I think it's off the wall street I I've been up there\nAnd I know what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah like north ... and nice to the airport yes sorry come over there and stay on the ladies down point\nThe point was that she opened up a first ladies are ... first ladies are doing that again oh sorry I make the noise the it's on the thing that will keep\nCarrying does or you know ... ... that was a professor we speak with our hand exactly mine are now\nSafely where I cannot beat on any third um especially about but we are going to have a really exciting time looking at this first ladies at first coast because it was all ethnic groups came out to be in this and this was\nOut of eight hundred students they have a quarter now thirty percent of the girls who are wanting to be there for leadership for education for virtue for really important Miller kind to motives they've come out to ... years\nIn exile in opportunity for this young lady to begin the transformation back to a time in our country when we survived and thrived based\nOn what happens if in your entrepreneur program your women learned to be chefs\nOr learned home economics or learned financial aspects of running a home or learn all of those things that used to be taught in what used to be called home ec\nAnd it was you know they learn typing and and cooking and sewing and all of this stuff why and you look at me with that face and you're saying no we want to teach them computer programming and and financial incentive\nNot to have an ... honestly\nAnd [laughter] and an awesome thing for entrepreneurship but bill what I'm hearing from you as a thought that those roles only blonde females today we unloading the dishwasher\nOr do they are they load the dishwasher in my household and he was male thirty percent of the nurses are almost ... are a male male now and I and I\nFailed at skills everybody has a skill they have a talent that they can use we need to do a better job in our city and our country of identifying what people's talents are ending giving them the education and training that allows them to\nBe the best that they can be relevant given that talent and give them they're going to decide\nThat you just sadly in the sense that you just said you said you know we need to yet so do we have to contrived need\nI don't think it's going to try and you know I think what I'm hearing or it in the long time and we need we need to give people skills but those skills need to be in my opinion and in the opinion of many scholars\nThat will and it's not just chauvinist to pigs like myself that think this way we need to give people skills along their gender lines because the blurring of the gender line is causing a big problem in our culture\nYou know we need to get people skills that aligned best with what those natural gifts that they have the natural gas deem that they have in the natural ... that they have\n... are very very good there are some women who are very good at mechanical things we ... you know I mean if you if you ate what they cooked you eat it would be your last meal on them on the planet\nIf you if you ate what they cooked you he would be your last meal on them on the planet you know not ever going to be looks but some men are really brilliant cooks insurance exactly\nWe find out and we have wonderful testing now free testing on the Internet I was just talking with a woman and she did for a Jacksonville University for years she did their career\nPlanning and she was telling me that they have great free software now and she's volunteering to come out and work with our new group there and do some career planning\nThat's why don't we take this opportunity you're just going to fight in the every tooth and nail on this but why don't we take this opportunity to guide people nudge people push people in the direction of a career that falls along gender lines\nWhy not make instead of thirty percent of all nurses now being mail let those and I when I say male thirty percent of all nurses are male thirty percent of all nurses are not men thirty percent of all all nurses are male why don't we kind of push\nThose women back into those generally accepted nurse rules where the nurses the female and the doctor is the mail and get back to a time when the gender lines weren't blurred\nYou know in the Nineteen fifties we didn't have people going to the Supreme Court or when they were going to high school in St Johns county not mentioning any names wanting to use the boys locker room where the boys bathroom\nThat lead lead different nobody in charge him where what happens is you start saying we allow the thought that homosexuality is normal in our society the thought to interracial marriage and children of inter racial marriages are normal in this society\nAnd once we normalized something it's very easy to get it over on people and then what happens we get more blurring of what we need to do in our country to get back to a morally centered traditionally based family oriented country [noise]\nAnd you see that's what I'm saying is that you it's got to start the longest trip starts with the first step and then in this particular case you have an opportunity to take the first step of driving generally female oriented rolls back into the minds of women as a good thing [noise]\nYou know it's a good thing to be a woman and be a nurse it's a good thing to be a woman and being account and it's a good thing to be a woman and to be a mom it's a good thing to be a stay at home mom where you can raise the kid you're listening I was speaking climbing on your host bill hey we're going to be back and just a couple of minutes\nBut lines are open to to to talk to two to eight to five five lake we're right back with you when we get that [noise]\nAnd and I don't get me wrong I'm In favor of keeping the monuments up I'm In favor of teaching history I'm In favor of all of that but what I'm saying is we have to be\nFair and and we in order for us to call the kettle black\nWe can't be doing the same stuff and the people that are getting paid that wait a minute hang our second\nHang on to people that are getting paid at one point in time just got a free meal and before that point in time they just got a free sign and before that point in time they just got a free bus ride to the event so this is escalating of fluids\nAnd escalating dramatics and that's all I'm saying to you is the action absolutely\nNot cooking more wrong\nOkay under there is no there is no comparison in any way shape or form bill absolutely not\nThere's been a whole lot of the\nReality of it is you when you when you're faced with an action you have to respond to it with an equal action now the reality of the the the important thing is and how you respond to it you have to respond to with measure and you have to respond with restraint and that's exactly what we did today\nOkay so let me stay on their talk amongst ourselves and hold up flags ... screaming and yelling and people were throwing things weren't threatening and physical violence we just stood there and held the flags\nOkay so was this event this event was as I understand it a walking tour to meet at having plaza and then march to\nA Confederate park and it was a march by take 'em down jacks to promote the idea of removing Confederate monuments from\nI'm from in front of the city's public property is that correct\nOr how one and some water the arguments for removing removing ...\nBefore we get into the arguments thing\nI'm trying to this thing of mostly people who do not belong to this community\nOkay but what I'm just saying this was an advertised event for people that wanted to participate in that in March argue now saying that every one that has an organized that that is a protest requires a counter protest\nAt this point in time with the issues that are there no I mean you're you're again you're broad brushing things and taking things so far out of perspective\nThere are there no I mean you're you're again you're broad brushing things and taking things so far out of perspective\nI just ask you a question and does every protest now require a counter protest that's not I do not defined every protests bill if there is a march as to what if there are some march\nTo identify civil war monuments and to promote taking them down should there at the same time be a flood of people on the same day at the same of that that says no leave 'em up\nOkay we'll say and again you're going you're you're you're engaging hyperbole because there's never been a flood and there wasn't a flood today so you're you're miss miss a characterizing circumstance okay the reality of it the reality of it is the people and everybody has a right to to speak their ... speak their mind\nIt's called freedom of speech but the reality is that the arguments that people are using to to to take down the the the southern monuments are arguments which are based on lies and false statements\nOkay and and you know that you may ... may be true and\nThe motivation oh a second but motivations are these people to do this are coming from outside the city and they're coming from people like George short so sometimes fire\nOkay that may be true and I understand and I'm On your side I Want them left up I Do I think that they have an opportunity\nOr we have an opportunity to teach people about the wrongs of the civil war we have an opportunity to not create or repeat the same mistakes again but I also believe that\nWe are in a where we're in a mine is bigger than yours type effort in many of these cases if if we pay no attention to the folks in the gallery\nAnd I and and break and I have had that discussion before there are times when it's best to just leave them alone because if you leave them alone the media will quit showing up and they'll go someplace else right and and that is true that I'd like to also to pass Confederate park\nI can I can do to get knocked out yeah that that's different things aren't\nYou're listening to I'm speaking plenty I'm Still have when we get back we've got more topics along
