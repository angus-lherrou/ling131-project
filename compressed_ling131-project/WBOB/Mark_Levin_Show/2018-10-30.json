Eighteen Ninety eight United States versus one Kim arc we've talked about this I've written about it [noise] and that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise]\nUm but the decision conferred birthright citizenship on a child of legal residents of the United states\nNow the majority is broad enough to include children born illegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided it wasn't even presented to the court and so of course you have individuals\nFor trying to read it in to the court has

of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens\nAnd we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants\nHospitals never asked any questions and H H death on the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true because everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded right I mean that's the whole point that\nThey're not subject to American law they everybody agrees\nChildren a diplomat tourists\nWho just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but just because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then she'd or a burst birthright citizenship to the United states if you say from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed a citizenship papers and the path administer agents had been extremely lax\nAnd in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act\nTrump is actually restoring\nThe real law on this dates back to the use this as grants attorney general or just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment passed he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then it said the same thing this justice pray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\n... now let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious legality for the president had to do this was an executive order let's walk through this together so\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy starts conferring citizenship when the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution it takes hold throughout the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy Daniel her watch\n[noise] the further than\nThe president you know so if president says you know what\nI I I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of stuff\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote in my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty the executive branch made this decision I imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote\nWe're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation\nAnd again the let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's merely merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative\nA lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative review we are not in lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call the president now if we disagree with something but everything he has done an immigration is actually\nThe base statute its past administrations have done this a verdict that he's changing\nSo I mean is the head of the executive branch he doesn't need a statute or to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute doesn't\n[noise] no no and left Congress the only thing that could happen if Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say they also give a citizenship to all legal they they could do that\nBut until they went ... isn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts outta control even these so called constitutional is on the court\nYou know to stay on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereign ... sessions um I I don't know if we have five votes I doubt Roberts will be with\nUs but I don't I I don't I don't think a cabinet would be with us\nI think yeah I mean I I Know Tom it would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty\nBut but here's the broader question issuing citizenship birth certificates that is an executive power who's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundation on national question\nAnd the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month respite so we could vet people coming here from six\nMajority Muslim countries that are spreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even include a majority of Muslim countries with the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court some circuit courts you you have to hold your breath\nOwned and by the way since Trump won in Trump via why in the Supreme Court subsequent lower courts have come back and basically repeal that Supreme Court decision\nThey're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policies and this is what happens in I I don't know the answer for this one as a society as a body politic\nBoth the executive branch and member of Congress both parties say let's see what the courts say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power side by side but standing over then we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would stay the same thing if Congress were to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress making it illegal for local communities to thwart federal immigration law is unconstitutional\nNot the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise] well here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking this on now I hear some of the race Bayer is on cable TV while actually became will he be filled with race matters and I heard one of them say recently that today the president brought this up the ... division\n... even bring it up he was asked about by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that there quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice and even said I don't know how you got that information and they turn it into a race issue of course they're going to write\nOh you got that information and they turn it into a race issue of course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd it's really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence would actually the vision would actually be actualize men the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that shouldn't citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being bastard die to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a ...\nMinute let me just say that I have to go so let let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nThat amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil the post civil war amendments was to protect former slaves had nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of their nothing whatsoever\nSo the left pours the agenda ended the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Horwitz keep up the good work much appreciate it my friend thanks so much God Bless and

Michigan\nOh we have absentee ballot and but uh but no early voting that we may see you know in other states\nAll right so it's very important that people get out on election day in Michigan tell us about your race what the key issues are in your opponent to of\nCourse well ah the key thing about this race we have the opportunity to boot Michigan for I'm a combat veteran Hawaii that turned out west point graduate who served in Iraq and Operation Iraqi freedom of seven ... seven hundred and fifty hours combat or over there and I came back to grow my family's business\nI'm from thirty five million a hundred and thirty seven million but most importantly created a hundred jobs in\nAnd around the country I Believe that having experienced a in combat helped me to understand national security or in a way that my opponent can't and understand veterans' issues in a way that my opponent has failed to but also I'm a business standpoint understanding how to grow our economy but also create economic opportunity for people who have been sales for decades\nMy opponent is a forty year career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years\nShe's only accomplish getting five or a co sponsor built into law three of which are to rename buildings I I truly believe that we have folks in Washington or legislating regulator teachers are not going to be a part of\nAnd this will not change until until we stand up and take our government back\n[noise] that's amazing how long has she been in the Senate she's been in the center for Eighteen years and she's been in state government forever to ride\nYes she was actually I'm a first elected a forty three years ago in Nineteen Seventy five one in the near the Vietnam War officially ended yet a number of weeks ago she stood in front of a veterans service organizations\nAnd said that she was unaware of veterans issues that they weren't a radar screen we have been at war over a decade and a half and we still haven't welcome to Vietnam veterans back properly and this didn't make it get a higher priority list that's unacceptable\nI get to Washington I'm going to make sure that we prioritize our veterans that we prioritize healthcare would prioritize education to make sure that everybody back to the American dream\nNow your website is John James percent at that time so people want to contribute to your campaign all over the country and people in Michigan want to get involved in the last week you got campaign they go to John James for Senate dot com correct\nThat's right they can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at jobs and and I mean let me tell you I'm this racism play with my candidacy out when we first started out we were twenty three points out and I have the last five six points down but as we all know the liberals have done a wonderful job\nOf shaming people and bullying people into not expressing their opinions and so given the fact that straight ticket voting is not no longer allowed or Michigan and the fact that conservatives don't poll we vote I Believe that we even closer than that um last quarter we always gotta be

staple grassroots army folks were on the state and around the country we raised two million dollars to her a four hundred and Seventy one thousand we have the momentum in this race and uh by your help and assistance but we're going to win this thing in ...\nCounty yeah tell me about the the two or three or four issues that you think are paramount\nUh well I mentioned them a veterans' issues I Believe that our veterans are facing\nLet me let me let me address it this way economically the president seems to be doing the the right thing your your opponent opposed the tax\nCuts I assume you would have supported them absolutely your opponent\nCuts I certainly would have supported them absolutely\nYour opponent supports a massive bureaucracy with massive regulations without a legislative authority from Congress that that affects Democrats or Republicans and every kind of business whether it's car manufacturing or small businesses I assume you support the the direction in which the administration is going\nAbsolutely and and this is part of the problem\nRight now uh you have people in Washington my Debbie Stabenow who are trying to legislate a ... legislate industries they never run a business before and right now over burdensome regulation the over taxation is creating a environments that are actually shipping jobs off\nOr to to places like China and Mexico and turkey and then selling those goods and to compete with us or that they're going to be that that are that the administration is now correct that I Believe that by supporting a pro business environment it helps to bring all ship stuff\nAnd the folks like Senator step now not only failed to vote for the tax cuts in jobs that it also created opportunities owns a in rural and urban areas around the country\nBut she's also voted to raise our taxes hundreds of times over the past Eighteen years she's not a a friend of business she's not a fighter economic growth and uh I'll tell you a she supports the socialist\nI'm a ... agenda that will bankrupt our children's future\nAnd you know she goes back to Michigan\nAnd she tries to appeal to Republicans independence blue collar workers by by doing this I'm a moderate I'm a centrist I can work with the other side but she's hardcore left and she votes for sure I'm ready to be the leader of the Democrats and she votes against cabin on she basically is a reliable left wing vote correct\nA marker is even worse than that uh according to the left or center a center is happening now despite all of her a bipartisanship is above where is the sixty ninth most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate that puts her more liberal than Elizabeth Warren\nDebbie Stabenow is more liberal than Elizabeth Warren and she supports things that that that many people in the state a state that Donald Trump won\nAbsolutely find reprehensible a lot of cases are stepping up not bipartisan in fact she goes through in Ninety five percent of the time and Hillary
