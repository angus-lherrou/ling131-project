[noise]\nBy the way that's just some of what boys have to deal with [noise]\nJust talking about the importance of supporting our police because of what goes on out there that's the kind of crap they were dealing with today in the capital as you have the the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint who\nDoesn't want to be part of that will leave ideology and by the wayside for a moment water into things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now let's\nBe real for a moment ... those folks into the our our ... prose they're paid these are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we got to work we have lives\nAnd we uh you know go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers are up to today yes those are all the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they are willing to get arrested so yes they do they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nIs the second was talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside\nBut the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is April ... ... refugees and I have long had my focus on refugees for a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees now a lotta was made though it wasn't\nBig in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the fewest refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\n... when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we tried to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay you to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed does that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that word skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason\nPeople automatically suggested we have a responsibility and that kind of cost to import people in ... competed against the most vulnerable in our society [noise]\nIf you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society you to be mentally opportunity for Donald Trump is doing his policy [noise] once again [noise]\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise] suicides histories one side of the fact I'm Brian much in the right one more towards the\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after my God the Irish to designate Nathaniel ... case as the and the status currently\nNot collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousand to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the Irish call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nUh let's see ah I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you in\nGo it's the are you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and\nIt's especially coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so\nI'm everything that the media puts out toward this they're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week I Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom of the United states of America and twenty sixteen than any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOf us out there are a lot of good folks that better really do get to embed do support you and I know just often isn't depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but the stay strong and and thank you guys for all you do or certainly is appreciated\nBy we'll switch gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe\nGo [noise] [noise]\nHey Joe Joe Europe [noise]\nAlright Joe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois Glenn go\nOr can you hear me good yeah we got you\nOkay hey thanks for taking my call and thank you for all that you know\nI'm I'm call on a\nCentral Illinois I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from\nBut I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that turban from my home town of ... I heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh and I was appalled\nA that's\nThere's no uh respect there no uh uh no uh professional demeanor now and I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois take care of an old saying that apology\nNo doubt and I I credit senator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I caught a conversation with him I gave her credit for that no doubt\nShe her find this moment and uh you're absolutely right about urban and all the others I mean me how many politicians are we we started with Chuck Schumer today and be Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a line\nHe before we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any facts present it said that he believes her and what happened in this country in part\nBecause of people like Dick Durbin because the people like Chuck Schumer who said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country to go to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nHey guys how are you all very much for your show you a great show [noise]\nUh I just wanted to say I'm finally proud of the Republicans are independent but I'm really finally proud of the Republicans they started fighting back\nUh it looks like a karate kid number three hundred and fifty or where you know I'm actually I ate trout go out and not ... or ... or ... how to fight back\nAgainst the early age and the Democratic definitely didn't expect dish so they they they got there they handed to them so\nYou got an interesting take here this is not something that's been advanced it at least in my presence before I'm I'm interested if you get your take you were saying that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary juice for Chuck Grassley to figure out that he is now washed job for Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have a backbone for Lindsey Graham too I don't know it actually attempt to be Spartacus is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\n... really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every guy literally critics okay everybody everybody would go hide under rocks\nAnd now they're all coming back and they're standing up I mean [noise] community I mean I get to recover cascade or pick that could be\nAnd then turn around and when it stepped in it but ah it's okay see I ...

quickly as possible because they really are going to dinner or will be down on the floor yes dinners down on the floor\nWe take up the arena floor and uh it's a good presentation we've got some a couple of little surprises and they're very very patriotic kind of thing which obviously we need to be a especially now especially when you look at what has happened in the last a couple of weeks with Brett Kavanaugh\nA you look at the fear that people have whereas they begin to realize just the extent of the socialism that is involved with the the Democrat side here in Florida the Andrew Gillum Gillum and I and the the attorney general Kennedy Sean shock both of them\nAnd and and I can't tell you you will have my ... dying at gratitude for that truly truly\nDying granted I don't care about a young guy gratitude I just need a free ticket to the leader of the body wants a free ticket to the him at all and the war\nAnd of course you know it is a fundraiser for the Republican Party does our county and we doing it because we absolutely have an incredible amount of amount of of of things we need to do to get the vote out to make sure that we beat the Democrats and don't turn in Florida into a socialist state so I I I'm actually raising the money because I Need to spend the money\nOK Holly go ahead now we're back on track with you\nSay where we're eating dinner friday night and not the managers a daughter who works up there at the restaurant just turned Eighteen and she had to come over and tell us that she just turned Eighteen and she said you know I can now\nAnd I said I Am so glad to hear a young person saying that she said well it was kind of scary at school today\nAnd the one that gal said as a guidance counselor now this is a person of authority at this high school\nOut here and told her all I Need is your sense of security number and I can register you to vote [noise] that that's OK my mom's gonna take me he said well if you don't have your Social Security number we can you get your driver's license\nShe's like that's okay I'm going to ring or myself so my question is how many other students say she'd done this too and filled out the card for them\nAnd you have a

appointment and saying okay great you know we've got you just feel this out and sign it and will will will will have the doctor come out and see right away it's their voter registration forms\nAnd the people just going okay they're feeling about this I don't know\nSo it ... here's a legal mind boggling\nYeah here's my question is they're not an obligation by the folks that are signing you up to tell you or is it just a case that you just are supposed to read whatever you saw\nA yeah I mean there's there's nothing in the law that says you know I I guess because they didn't really believe that people are going to be compliant ah ... there's nothing in law that says oh by the way this is a voter registration form I I you know I mean it's bizarre but\nProbably I appreciate and update if you do decide to call them all and if you if I Want\nTo know what gives this woman the right to think she can fill out the form for an Eighteen year old right and left me a ... because you and I both know that the kid filled it out herself and check the little are box it would have gone in the garbage\nProbably maybe yeah let me ask you this uh you you have my of course you are my number text me over

Hi my question is I'm stuttering through my words\nHow how offended how sexually assaulted our fending worry you if you didn't make a police report in didn't tell an adult didn't tell an instructor didn't go to the hospital and then you wait at thirty five years and how offended were yeah and then\nYeah yeah and then you top it off by by naming specifically and aiming for witnesses who all of whom say no way that I wasn't there I don't know anything about it this is nonsense I ... the whole thing is\nUnbelievable and it broke prove just how far these Democrats were willing to go to to to get their way at the in the old you know the ends\nJustify ... she's a doctorate of psychotherapy yeah yeah I think what they meant to say is she needs to see a doctor\nIt it sounds more and more like that's exactly the case although I Know I'm going to get myself in trouble with this but I was a nurse and the way back when you were and now a\nUs every day but it's ... ... ... these people that were in these you you see all these interns coming through for psychology they were crazy and they were they were they were they were in that field or maybe they were looking for a cure and are looking for rare honestly honestly they kind of looking for that self awareness kind of thing\nSo yeah yeah well anyway I think that it has I think the the last Ninety Days Ninety Days\nIs is an incredibly long times seven different FBI background checks yeah um it's amazing it reminds me of those seven background checks just trying to find something to try to find so I'm trying to find some\nMe of the four votes that the R E C took trying to get that ... you get ...\nUh the ... for a vote say did not want to see or hear it was too okay he wants to to real votes and to reach ... well anyway that was discussion about the let's move on and do vote G. O. P. dot com design GOP dot com okay that's where you buy it sounds like a oh\nTickets for that yes All right and we'll we'll be talking about it over the next couple of weeks but I got this little newspaper here yes there was apparently put out by you because it has a letter from you yes in here with the official CEO of the Republican Party of Duval county\nAnd um it talks about the amendments that that are good for us I'm Glad that you're not approving three\nUm I don't I'm not surprised that you're not approving for 'em because that would just put a a great deal more Democrats on the voting rolls a nine\nYeah kind of iffy about nine and ten so are you going to be putting together a list um maybe on the R E C Web page or something to actually\nI actually all four of these pages what he's talking about is the official voter guide from the Republican Party account kind of like a large version of currents quick fix you know what it is and a matter of fact somebody wondering what they call it the Republican quick fix I'm like maybe it's too soon\nBut yes it never to send to correct it tells you um are candidates it goes through the amendments and those that were endorsed by the Republican Party of Florida and then and we do a nice little comparison um regarding\nAndrew Gillum socialism versus a ... round Santa capitalism and and and liberty and freedom so ... there's a really good comparison ... there's some there's some interesting articles this three articles lifted as well that show you exactly what's going on as far as the gun control and and I'm\nNot his Gillum cozying up with the sheriff said Israel down in Broward County I had a guy\nBy a question for a long time listeners someone who calls your show also wanted to know is there a way to find out how many of these candidates that the Republican Party is promoting are represented by the same consulting\nFor us uh in that grouping you won't find many really they're all from different ... pretty much from that grouping to put you won't find a lot of them for for November of twenty Eighteen you won't find a lot of them\nGood deal you're listening I'm speaking plenty I'm your host bill hey I've I'm waiting for my second guessed command so Karen may be here may not be here when we get back well we'll go over everything she had to give force today as far as the Lincoln day benefit and we'll be right back\nBut it's being pushed back by a lot of young progressive mostly college kids from around\nA University of North Carolina ... identified even with the gender exactly yeah and in fact there is one state now in our country that is a not requiring the sex of a baby I think it's a New York is now requiring the sex of newborns to be placed on the birth certificate they can be left as as a circle\nWhich many people are now fighting the fact that it can be left as a circle because it stands for ... and it\nCould mean other oh my God so much to the male female or other ... about her yeah we're all other so so here's here's my\nQuestion for you and ... and here's here's my hypothesis we are going to do this like the like the scientific method like I'm going to generate a hypothesis and that hypothesis goes back several centuries\nMany centuries ... and and then we're going to bring that forward based on discussions that I've had with several people including two women at the airport yesterday\nUm that women have been\nA major part in the downfall of our society and our culture\nOver the last\nSeventy five years because and I'm going back centuries because over a period of time we allow more and more I'm active participation in roles that were generally male oriented\nBut I don't really see that these women who are causing all these issues are in these male oriented rules\nThey are as you said young progress is who who who are not in any role there just being led around by the nose basically being told what to say that they're being spoon fed this garbage is going in their heads and they have they're not old enough and have enough experience to figure it out but that doesn't\nMake a go deeper than that they're being led around there being spoon fed right and they're being listened to and\nThat it'd be too by the media who wants to push that same agenda\nRight and so it really didn't listen to them right if we didn't put a microphone and ... and ... eventually we might have some opportunity right and ceiling I touched on this last week about World War two\nAnd all the men being sent away the war and women running the rabbits and welding at well actually welding didn't really start until the end of World War two but\nBut running all the robots doing welding building the aircraft building the ammunition um\nAnd and there's some really funky things so they know about women didn't get paid\nThey got paid but their money was withheld and given to their parents or put an account he married\nUntil their husband came home and if their husband didn't come home then they could apply and show his death certificate or the little note did you learn from the military service it said you were I was I was ...\nTelegram and then they would if they were under the age of twenty five then the money that was in the account would be given to you or legal guardian which was your parents your mom or your dad my things or reason yeah but see that's the thing God\nI Know you guys cringe about yeah yeah but there was a time in this country when our country Rand better when women stayed at home well\nThey stayed at home and they still are probably pretty much ran the world anyway but um but but from behind the scenes\nAnd I agree with you a lot of times there is something to be said and I had a I had a no less than three our conversation with a woman\nIn North Carolina a woman spoke to you for three hours wow women always speak for three hours of no women always speak for three hours the amazing thing is when I was able to get a word in edgewise oh so that is the the we were in North Carolina I was doing work with the helicopter doing storm helping out which by the way is an incredibly\nIncredibly satisfy thing and then if you're up on my Facebook page eventually you're going to see a lot of videos or some of the ... that we went to in some of the things that we did while we were there\nAnd just absolutely amazing and satisfying thing when when an eighty nine year old woman comes out and gives you this huge hug because you brought her a case of water yeah yeah but you know just and it wasn't even ... it wasn't even the Evian sparkling water it was like a Walmart brand water whatever they can ... millions of yeah\nSo when you Thursday that's right I guess that's a conversation we're going forward with is the fact that when women were the nurtures and the ... took care of their home to care of the kids and the fathers were the hunter gatherers and provided the structure and the discipline in the home\nMhm we didn't have the kind of runaway crime problems that we have today and we didn't have the kind of inflationary actions that we have today now we've got women\nHaving their own income men having their own income

that got the voter's guide I wanted to thank you for that because you did an excellent job of explaining the ballot amen thank you ...\nThe language that you wrote the man is much easier to read than the\nBallot it [noise] um yeah which I which on the ballot it's sort of vague and a legal with that but you did a great job of explaining one however I Want to ask you what happened to amendment number because that's missing from the ballot\nIt is amendment aid is the um it dealt primarily with a couple of issues it dealt with the\nUm a requirement that all school boards throughout Florida would have term limits and it also dealt with allowing charter schools to\nWho may not be able to get approved in certain counties um to have a secondary process to to to get their licensing an end to start up another some some some ... county school boards\nWon't just will not allow charter schools to exist and so I gave them a second route to open and uh the teachers' unions in a couple of other groups took it to court and the court threw it out\nAll right so that's why she from the ballot halfway on\nOkay a fire in a way I ah I'm afraid that I'm In the governor's race I'm afraid that\nBill is going to win guilt by like\nI say this and that is running a very weak campaign he has an arsenal of ammunition and that he could be seen a good deal of them are right now such as the forty percent increase in the corporate tax an income tax\nWhere expanded Medicaid sanctuary cities like\nRepealing stand your ground and then he went up I don't hear this and it's heading again Obama on any of those issues and the way it's sad to see the ad that I saw I have to deal with this fan is playing little league baseball in Nineteen Ninety One\nYeah well that I hear you got to remember though is that right is I'm Sorry again I heard he got a new campaign he yeah he has um actually he does have a new campaign team and it's now being let 'em led by Suzie wiles who has a um she's the queen makers she she's yeah she's got a lot of the queen of the kingmaker and she was involved\nIn getting Rick Scott elected 'em both both times for him to governor uh enjoying you're going to see I didn't she was she was very involved with the Trump campaign and was the co chair for the Trump campaign for Florida yeah\nSo she's got a a a ... a huge volume of of of knowledge and experience that you know with her and so I think you're going to see some changes the other thing that that people kind of\nYou know when you're not in politics all the time you don't always think about it but those of us who watch politics are always looking where's that yard sign where's that ad oh my gosh oh my gosh and yet for the great majority of people I mean literally Ninety percent of the people who will eventually vote\nDon't aren't paying any attention in till somewhere between two to three weeks he exactly exactly and so what they do is they save up all of their time they buy ahead of time they by media um a a times than just the way ahead of time but they they load up\nSo that it starts hitting and you just hear boom boom boom they just pound the message pound the message pounded message but they wait until people are listening\nWhat they are the victims my issue is my issue is thinking that\nTheir mail and their victims because if they're if they're victims and their men you'll never hear about\nWell okay see from your perspective yes\nThe real man man I'm a I'm not going to go back and said to his wife\n\nPromotion nobody high then\nWait a second I think that's totally into there are plenty of men who believe that they are entitled to write to certain things particularly from our government so I disagree with that completely\nThere are plenty of males out there who may decide that they are our and\nNow they're not they're not matter minutes [laughter] and I found a ration though is that we've had this victim hood mentality and it's just overwhelming\nNow and it's overwhelming way and it wasn't as prevalent and now we're constantly bombarded by it and that's why I'm so into entrepreneurship because entrepreneurship is the way to get people to have the dignity of work\nBy understand and I liked that segue and there but it's a segue with a interesting premise\nBecause the programs\nThat we have for inner city youth and some of the other programs that are available for\nWomen's infants and children in snap snow Supplemental Nutrition and programs and the the weekend carry home food because mom and dad didn't want to get off the couch with cousin ... and go out and get a job and get some canned goods in the in the pantry\nThose programs are enabling an entire generation of people to sit on their front porch with their hands out\nThere also enabling the government to run more of their lives\nActually so what do we give up first we lose a generation of people which is the way I think we should go in fact about two generations I think anybody that is\nAge six or older currently\nIs lost in in various demographics around our country\n... ... you know and you can doubt me if you want but you take a little six year old African American kid and you take a a six year old ... Caucasian kid and a and a and a six year old Puerto Rican kid or Latin American kid or whatever you put them on the playground\nThey have no care in this world what color you are they only care if you can push 'em on the swings or if you've got to roll the kick ball or if you can shoot baskets or whatever\nThat's all they care about racism and division is is taught in the home\nAnd in the school and in the school okay it have ice in the school you very unfortunately but I just\nWanted to point out that at six they're not lost now they've lost a ton of ground but can we still recovered them at age six sure we can and I want to point out a really exciting thing that I heard from one of my entrepreneurs teachers this week she opened up at first post\nHigh school which isn't it tough tough neighborhood is that\nThe former Nathan be forced\nHigh school I Know isn't that on the west side you know I'm Still learning my way around it I think for us now or is it now as an aside west side you know I'd have to ride it out right first coast is north I think it's a ... street I I've been up there\nAnd I know what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah like north league and nice to the airport yes sorry come up with that Sam ladies down point\nThe point was that she opened up a first ladies are ... first ladies are doing that again oh sorry I make the noise beat on things that will keep\nCarrying around it but you know it was a professor we speak with her hand exactly mine are now\nSafely way I cannot beat on any third especially about but we are going to have a really exciting time looking at this first ladies at first coast because it was all ethnic groups came out to be and this and this was\nOut of eight hundred students they have a quarter now thirty percent of the girls who are wanting to be there for leadership for education for virtue for really in ... ... ... are kind of ... motives they've come out to any here\nIs an excellent opportunity for this young lady to begin the transformation back to a time in our country when we survive and thrive based on\nWhat happens if in your entrepreneur program your women learned to be chefs or learned home economics or learned financial aspects of running a home or learned all of those things that used to be taught\nFinancial aspects of running a home or learn all of those things that used to be taught in what used to be called home ec\nAnd it was you know they learn typing and and cooking and sewing and all of this stuff why and you look at me with that face and you're saying no we want to teach them computer programming and and financial planning I\nNow have an ... an awesome thing for entrepreneurship but bill what I'm hearing from you as the thought that those roles only blonde female today we unloading the dishwasher\nAnd they are they did on a load the dishwasher in my household and he was male thirty percent of the nurses are almost ... are a male male\nNow and I and I just kills everybody has a skill they have the talent that they can use we need to do a better job in our city and our country of identifying what people's talents are ending giving them the education and training that allows them to\nBe the best that they can be relevant given that talent and given their then decide when to just\nSadly in the sense that you just said he said you know we need to\nDo that so do we have some contrived need\nI don't think it's going to try and you know I think what I'm hearing or me while I come and we don't need we need to give people skills but those skills they need to be\nIn my opinion and in the opinion of many scholars that will and it's not just chauvinist pigs like myself I think that's why we need to give people skills along their gender lines because the blurring of the gender line is causing a big problem in our culture\nYou know and we need them to get people skills that aligned best with what those natural gifts that they have the natural gas deem that they have in the natural ... that they have throughout ... are very very good there are some women who are very good at mechanical thing\nWe had an eight ... you know I mean if you if you ate what they cooked you eat it would be your last meal on them on the planet to ever going to be cooks but some men are really brilliant cooks insurance exactly\nWe find out and we have wonderful testing now free testing on the Internet I was just talking with a woman and she did for a Jacksonville University for years she did their career\nPlanning and she was telling me that they have great free software now and she's volunteered to come out and work with our new group there and do some career planning that's\nWhy don't we take this opportunity you're just going to fight and Harry tooth and nail on this but why don't we take this opportunity to\nGuide people nudge people push people in the direction of a career that falls along gender lines\nWhy not make instead of thirty percent of all nurses now being mail let those and I when I say male thirty percent of all nurses are male thirty percent of all nurses are not men\nThirty percent of all nurses are male why don't we kind of push those women back into those generally accepted nurse rules where the nurses the female and the doctor is the mail and get back to a time when the gender lines want blurred\nYou know in the Nineteen fifties we didn't have people going to the Supreme Court or when they were going to a high school in St Johns county not mentioning any names wanting to use the boys locker room where the boys bathroom\nThat lead lead different nobody in charge him where what happens is you start saying we allow the thought that homosexuality is normal in our society the thought to interracial marriage and children of inter racial marriages are normal in this society and once we\nNormalize something it's very easy to get it over on people and then what happens we get more blurring of what we need to do in our country to get back to a morally centered ... family oriented country [noise]\nYou see that's what I'm saying is that you it's got to start the longest trip starts with the first step and in this particular case you have an opportunity to take the first step out driving generally female oriented rolls back into the minds of women as a good thing you\nKnow it's a good thing to be a woman and be a nurse it's a good thing to be a woman and be an account and it's a good thing to be a woman and to be a mom it's a good thing to be a stay at home mom where you can raise the kid you're listening to our speaking climbing fire hose bill hey we're going to be back and just a couple of minutes\nLines are open to to to talk to two to eight to five five lake we're right back with you when we get back [noise]\nAnd and I don't get me wrong I'm In favor of keeping the monuments up I'm In favor of teaching history I'm In favor of all of that but what I'm saying is we have to be fair\nAnd and we in order for us to call the kettle black we can't be doing the same stuff and the people that are getting paid the wait a minute hang our second hang on the people that are getting paid at once\nAid now wait a minute hang our second hang on to people that are getting paid at one point in time just got a free meal and before that point in time they just got a free sign and before that point in time they just got a free bus ride to the event so this is escalating of fluids\nAnd escalating dramatics and that's all I'm saying to you is the action absolutely\nNot could get more wrong\nOkay there is no there is no comparison any way shape or form bill absolutely not there's been a long line and the\nReality of it is you when you when you're faced with an action you have to respond to it with an equal action now the reality of the ... the important thing is and how you respond to it you have to respond to with measure and you have to responded with restraint and that's exactly what we did today\nOkay so let me stay down there talk amongst ourselves and hold up flags ... screaming and yelling if people were throwing things at night threatening and physical violence we just stood there and held the flags\nOkay so was this event this event was as I understand it a walking tour to meet at ... plaza and then march to\nA Confederate park and it was a march by take 'em down jacks to promote the idea of removing Confederate monuments from\nI'm from\nIn front of the city's public property is that correct or\n... and so what are the arguments for removing removing ...\nBefore we get into the arguments thing\nI'm trying to think of mostly people who do not belong to this community\nOkay but what I'm saying is this was an advertised event for people that wanted to participate in that march are you now saying that every one that has an organized of that that is a protest requires a counter protest\nAt this point in time with the issues that are there no I mean you're you're again you're broad brushing things than taking things so far out of perspective\nI just ask you a question and does every protest now require a counter protest that's not I do not\nDefined every protest bill if there is a march test of what\nIf there are some march to the dentist by civil war monuments and to promote taking them down should there at the same time be a flood
