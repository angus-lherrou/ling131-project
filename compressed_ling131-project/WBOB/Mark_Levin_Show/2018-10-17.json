they they were coming from a crowded party and what they are and he only had like family knew me\nThere by ... and her ... the problem that makes me on the ball and my idea my idea is that I Believe than\nLetting you a ... year raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically involved in the bowl leaned over a long window of time\nThat you're not a typical from a lot of likely Trump voters and even the ... is typical because I'm not sure if the delineation between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels\nBut what I Will say and I see there's a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWe're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately is how do you want your government to be run\nNow and the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump likely to strip the any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned no is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage now he's on\nOr for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells us much so you do have a lot of fiscal conservatism I'll give you an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but I personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life\nAs kind of like a half assed Catholic and I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be true so I Want to be honest [laughter] so I got to have as Catholic but I you know I had here too that that kind of value system for so for example\nYou know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to\nGet the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated based upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nBut didn't have to be created because we put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have ... you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you had the recreational use in several more states oh rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana no not\nI don't care about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well it needs to be either legalized or as a minimum decriminalize by the ...\nLike marijuana as well and needs to be either legalized or at the minimum decriminalized by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is something we never knows that the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we got all this kind of horse crap stuff going on where you can't use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a winter not because you can't actually issue a prescription because by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drug\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from more\nOf a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger\nUh is the Republican ask again butters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional as so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been a victim best to you and your family or and may God Bless\nAnd by the way for a hike camp in North Dakota I mean come on\nEven the high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about a state that Trump won by thirty six

Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent\nSo to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals of the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican in one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're seven at three majority seven three one vacancies now available but that's going to be one of the stray so it was gonna say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level\nAnd all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges so before you get too far it up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to all those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict court about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be in office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally dealing with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent and the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and the way by thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen there's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term\nContinuous more fun becomes available we have two lines open to be calling out seven seven three one two three one one eight seven seven three one two three one one bill Cunningham the great American in for the great ones [noise] mark Levin\nListen to what David as from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the ex chair provide\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs on sale now for one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L.

course killed himself\nNow it's a big story same thing happened Baton Rouge same thing happened with the re most in blue officers in New York City\nAnd there is a regular event in our country where

such other disrespect for police officers that weak minded nationalist and other hate filled individuals many mentally ill will take it upon themselves to hunt down officers to kill the murder without
