their lead from the Democrats I Believe the media now lead the way and the Democrats follow it let me underscore that points to the back ventures can repeated that the media lead the way the Democrats follow\nI'll give you an example is really precious little reporting on the fact that despite all the demand for another FBI background investigation\nThat Dr Ford's allegations could provide no corroboration whatsoever no evidence whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever\nNone\nNo corroboration whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever no evidence whatsoever they went back and they interviewed may ...\nAnd so they trashed the FBI report while they did an interview Dr Ford there's nothing to ask Dr Ford and if they did interviewed Dr Ford\nReally then you would need a criminal investigation of which this is not a for her to explain her inconsistencies and so forth and all these witnesses who she says she has or doesn't have would have to be interviewed in that context but they

one one boy one afternoon WB you'll be [noise]\nLet's take some calls\nJT Fairfax, Virginia the great WMA I'll go\nA Mark I'm really thrilled to be on the air with us my name is Jay you do it all and my father was a conservative Republican representative from northern California for Eighteen years same\nTime remember his name\nYet uh the corrupt media Democrats under Nancy Pelosi as well as the corrupt leadership of the Justice Department I worked very hard for me and my father and our family or they had to fight hard for eight years and and spend over a million dollars in legal fees\nRemind me what happened\nWell they were my dad was in the Republican leadership\nAnd they were friendly with Jackie from off and just fire guilt by association they are Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried to tried to take my dad and my family down but unfortunately or fortunately excuse me after eight years\nOr putting them severely financially in debt or my parents were able to weather the storm and and come out victorious\nWhere their charges brought against them\nNot a single indictment there were eight years of investigation\nOr put them a million dollars to spend a million dollars just defending themselves like yeah\nCan you imagine ... being investigated for eight years\n... years the the FBI they'll have returned some of the personal effects\nAre they took from my family so that whole cabinet the tuition very much at home to me because I Believe they've tried to do the same thing to this good man at the time with my father the good news is my dad weather the storm even though my parents were ruined financially they didn't fold under the pressure to admit to something they didn't do and thankfully neither is cabinet\nOr the the real reason I'm calling because I never heard one bit of our politics I certainly never considered myself a conservative but the aftermath of the two thousand and six year lecturing changed everything for me believe it or not I was planning on voting for Hillary I Know that sounds crazy but I I was basing that decision purely on how I Believe\nShe presented herself on TV during a three televised debates I thought that she represented herself more presidential a but that stupid that down I'm sure there's a lot of other people who did the same thing\nA Democrat they're very good at looking polish on television they have a great outer filled with no substance underneath a but it was it was after the election right started to realize how crooked one side of the media was\nAnd it was this that started the wheels turning in my head\nUm then seeing all the venomous attacks by liberal on social media towards myself and others are for daring to have a different opinion which that would really energized me to get in the fight\n'em I'm now serving a Republican threw him through and I would absolutely be voting Republican in the upcoming elections I've got to imagine there's there's other people more like me out there people who are getting much without politics before the election or people who are starting to have their eyes open to what is happening in our our all ready to get into the fight\nAt this point I really believe this is a fight or flight Britain's good versus evil you know Republicans stand for freedom in the constitution\nVersus Democrats represent hate and are working hard to take away our individual God given liberties\nNow only friend when I think you're exactly right and my best to your family I'm Sorry you had to go through that you take care of yourself [noise] M. J. Fort Lauderdale Florida Sirius satellite go right ahead please\nHigh high enough to live and how you doing this evening right thank you fly probably like you know first and foremost um my son and he was I just turned fourteen just finished reading liberty and tyranny\nAnd left it and he's working on making America healthy yeah there is a tough ... proudly now he's ... we've been cutting between\nCrack haven't\nBroken writing a report on it um yeah but I Am I listen I just first one and I love your show on Sundays off her it's great and I'm just wanted to say thanks for everything you do have a bad heart but you get your keep pumping oh my goodness and looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so am I Can't wait to this particular that great\nI wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know ... with the last two loving women and supporting women and all that good stuff and I don't think I'm Dr for its lawyers really care about her care about women because\nI thought um I just kind of thought with general I'm a former marine cells I just got along with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not shore\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble garage sale and I thought but Martha Stewart maybe not inside of training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for mayor lying to the FBI\nUm if if the left cared about her including the Democrats in all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford's attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabinet ... why would they want the FBI to ask one question\nIf the FBI ask one question just something like hey do you fly on airplanes she's done she's only jail\nBut none of that but here's here's the thing for the FBI agree with you but they're not doing a criminal investigation\n... this is what judge the pilot tunnel doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know plead the ... and that sort of saying what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various allegations that were made and that's it\nRight now under title Eighteen\nWhat title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section of thousand and one false statements yes\nYeah I mean that's ... that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth [noise] they're doing a criminal investigation they would have to be an issue in letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nUh then they're going to know if they want to do search warrants probable cause it's none of that was\nOnly understand that that's what they want because obviously they want to watch the times they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course we all know to drag it out but they don't care about the second is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want they don't want this they don't have an hour which so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for the victim if they drag this out\nNow that the the the way as if you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jay do get your point and I hope you feel well a given your week hard I Know the feeling I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer ... to\nMarch first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner in crime or Sean Hannity I didn't know what we would do without you know you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up and maybe I Need a little more understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford\nWhy not for the sake of appearance and\nTo not about appearances they had a limited amount of time listen appearance is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not in so we on the right we have to start to understand this or we constantly\nNot and so we on the right we have to start to understand there's ... constitutionalist it's not about um a pass the time the media ... pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in yeah\n... and so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\n... these are the same people who said the man is guilty ... job interview and that ... the ... and the and that the uh uh the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better at the FBI interview the two others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer\nChuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\n[laughter] that's what we're up against against truly diabolical individuals so you're not going to be able to appease them under any circumstances probably right\nBack [noise]\nHere's the truth about most home security companies they're like dealing with another bad cable company you spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone and get questions answered and then when you write your limit

look at these facial expressions of the president hey look at the way he slurs as words\nLook at the way he carries himself this guy's got problems right here we are two years later I might tell you that this guy is a rock star and a genius and and is is bearing these guys which is very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then they carry for each area for a doctor that he\nThat that was the one that did all this uh investigation on itself because they're forced to go through all the medical hoops\nAnd from that and this guy gets lifting garbage as well because he came out said they didn't have all that he was very sounded very hill right right and what I Would have bought show\nJust says it's maddening as you as your conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that were working with nobody ever came I Apologize for for saying that Trump was the manager or has all that crazy fiction\nRight they're never going to apologize for it because they never will this is a hit and run bunch [noise] hit and run budge now they got this tax returns or a from two thousand two thousand one his father's taxes somehow they stole loews or somebody stole them and\nUh the ACLU isn't around to help the ACLU is thrown in with the uh\nThe tyrants All right my friend thank you for your call\nLet us continue\nLet's see here ah let us go to Ken Long Beach California eight Seventy the answer go\nYes mark I my question is are there any Senate precedents or any rules of the Senate would allow a Dianne Feinstein to be declared a ... to ... we choose for self or mini vote because of the alleged of involvement\nWith no they would have to have a financial interest or family member have a financial interest or something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth you know first of all you'd have to prove it so far they haven't proven in although we all know sheer somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so it'd be a sideshow\nAnd uh my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with a Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for now ... around with orange for person sorry\nWell if they vote for the for that means the holding in the circuit court below stance\nOkay and and there's there's there's no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court\nNow there could be that way I mean that would be good to have a recess appointment for record wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it oh you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not enough\nThere is angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their side\nWe need to when you listen and we need to we need we need to stop acting like losers and be on the defense here we need to ram this through no worry about recess appointments and ... and all the rest [noise] these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing it in the case of memory Cal skin Collins a Jew or you take this very very seriously\n[noise] All right my friend thanks for your call Frank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H.
