[laughter]\nWell I just really there are a lot of things that I heard that I really agree with and I could get off on a tangent\nWhile I like this woman [laughter]\nShe mentioned you're leaving us up and what I don't agree with that thought oh here it goes\nSo much regard to men and women and their uh their chosen career ideal and stuff and all my life and I work with um part of what I Do is people to ensure that their career is aligned with who they are\nSo I'm there might be getting now that very well their career is perfect for them to be in there I mean we look\nThere might be a male might be a male thank you\nYes so it could be you know looking at their their values their motivations are the nets no balance and so what we do we find that the we closed the gap between the employer employee eat people are happier that retention I actually go to the time\nBut what I what I Do agree lab in um I don't agree that women should be on the front line in the battlefield\nNow you do now that I Believe that Russian woman who was the sniper in history I don't recall her name so I'm ... and I do think that both men and women women would have a problem shooting small child but\nBut they

but\nThat one thing to prayer and pledge of allegiance I or go over\nAnd said oh well I think they're going to be changing and so I see now becoming more leak and little strong that we need people to stand up and say this is wrong this is right and part of a problem that people don't know if they're yeah they're going to buy a motion not my dream problem\nThe mad at yeah yeah yeah that that you know whenever I see a guy who is usually a barista at a Starbucks or he's a bartender at one of the craft brew houses and I see him wearing a man but I just I Am\nAbsolutely overwhelmed by the number of incredibly attractive young ladies that find that something that they\nWere very high C I I don't get Harry thank God I don't know\nWhere things have changed though we when we were kids who had the tattoos usually mailers sailors guy right in the military man right right and now the women have more tattoos guy\nSo yeah I Do [laughter] you know and I have seen thing happened to me on the beach I was walking and went up to our naval station near ... with lander without just I was just going to enjoy the beauty of the day but I had\nCompletely went right over there or anything I Know I Know I acted like I said I think yeah I don't I don't think I went oh she went up to her naval station and I said with lent or without any way when I had not near here\nWhich is that what we're gonna have to explain it to them it's just not that good anymore [laughter] go ahead\nAnd ... I had had some kind of a strong prejudice against tattoos I find them very very offensive and just I don't know if that offensive I just think they're gross and lower class and somebody had said oh my gosh what a judgmental person you are and I thought\nI'm not really that judgmental and so\nI said I'm going to talk to the next person I see us patches and so of course is the naval station and there was this group of four and I went up and talk to him and they said well each one of our cat to have the story\n... ... and they sat down and explain to me these stories about their lives and then I started asking people about their tattoos and that they had stories and\nAthlete that he has the story just find that to\nOur most you know really ugly ones are story about like for extra vodka is that\nThey have the story and their stories about how they wish they hadn't and now they're trying to get an author and all kinds\nOf stories but it's very intriguing just to hear people's life's journey and how they played out in the ...\nI first started this show I was on Saturday mornings for an hour this is going seven there while we're into the seven year now so\nI'm I made it on the cover of fully a weekly magazine ... thanks to age again ... for having gone to a to what was then the up first start year of one spark which I bill as nothing more than an incredible waste of time in ...\nOf one spark which I bill as nothing more than an incredible waste of time and money for a glorified art show but I ran into our standing in line to get a beer or something and\nTo notice that there was a young lady in front of me a very attractive twenty something young lady who had the entire\nPicture of the Mona Lisa done on her back from the ... of her neck\nTo the top of her waist the entire Mona Lisa and it it looked great it looked just like I was staring at the Mona Lisa\nBut it was done in such a way so that her bright white bra strap went right through the center of the Mona Lisa as mouth kind of like a big piece of tape and and I had heard him mentioned that\nOn a blog that I wrote ... 'cause I was actively I write a blog now about three days a week and back then I was writing a blog every day\nAnd that gets overwhelming real quickly for anybody that's ever written a bar but I wrote it in a G happen to have read it and then he just went off\nOn polio which is a badge of honor believe it or not errands ... says I have and on the cover of it of which I have probably about thirty five or forty copies of it if you'd like to have a\n... infant autographed copy I Know\nI'm not need to thank you he uh he put on there that I was slut shaming her\nBecause uh yeah and he actually put it on the cover literally ... radio talk show host do slut shaming at one spark\nAnd that was not my intention I just mentioned the fact that in forty years\nShe's not going to be so proud to have now a\nA octogenarian Mona Lisa on her back\nA and the amount of money that would require you know just a little tiny tattoo having removed just four or five thousand dollars a magic ... cars that are involved with removing an entire back print\nOr a sleeve now women are getting full sleep and and I've noticed that women in law enforcement\nMore than than any other trade that I've seen women in law enforcement are now getting full sleeves and\nYou know it's come up in years past I knew some business owners that were hiring people for receptionist positions\nAnd things of that nature and would completely discount candidates\nThan women yeah they were all new agents that right because uh women with full sleeve tattoos and I'm I'm seeing folks getting the neck tattoos and things of that nature and you know I understand it\nEvery tattoo has a story but you know some stories don't need to be told in public and and ... you know that's that's just think about what you want to be when you grow up\nAnd decide whether or not that tattoo of Elmer flood saying I think I saw that there's going to fit in with you being a Supreme Court justice and that\n[laughter] you know it might not be the best thing to do um but\nAnyway we talked about we were talking about women in society and taking a more active role and dissemination\nOf men and women have\nBy their very nature and also by rulings of the court ... an rulings society women have\nBeen successful in a mass killing men and and to the point to where it has changed man's role in society um and not for the better\nAnd and you still have there are there are certain jobs that run better when they're run by men regardless of whether or not you say\nYou know while women are just one chromosome away from being a man and we can do anything that man can do you know what you're absolutely right there's only one job and his entire world\nThat men can't do that women can do and that is half out over\nThe care well in ... and a man who had a child and he ... he was a man he went to transition ... not a man\nHow did that and I'm just trying to make the point that in London and they were letting him said that he wasn't a woman will rule that you had to put down that you were a woman if you had a baby and and so now they had a big hoopla but see\nNow you have ... you know it was a woman who was transitioning to a man ... okay so it was only a woman yeah and I salute the last like that all of these other trans out here that say they're trans look you can be trans whatever you want you can be\nTrans Siberian orchestra for all I care but you're still born with the chromosome that makes you a male or female\nAnd that's all you ... whatever you want to chop off or you can open up whatever you want to open up but you're still a male DNA speaking and until they can suck all that DNA out of your body and replace it\nWith some other gender DNA you're still either a male or female and the fact that we are accepting these people\nOpenly in our society without claiming that they're outright nut jobs is bringing down our society as a whole transgender isn't is a mental disorder\nAnd has traditionally been a mental disorder and he still is that\nWhen we start to influence the used with thoughts right that oh well Suzie says she doesn't feel like the girl she wants to be a boy or\n... says he wants to be ... you know and then you start to have well one of ... and so now everybody else wants to do it and you get a bunch of kids who are very confused\nAt times of life that are just confusing to begin with naturally\nConfusing to you know how many times in the world that is really an enemy and you're a guy especially those teenage years I'm ... devastating right well they're not devastating it's part of growing up it had a lively and physically all the changes that are happening in your body those are difficult times\nThey're all like the little girl because somebody calls attention to it let me tell you about the new parenting techniques we got a couple of minutes now falls on the street he falls off the end of his skateboard he falls down a slide your toddler whatever\nYou've pop your hands way to go you don't know\nIf it's in they cry\nListening I'm speaking plenty I still have isn't so much more when we get back phone lines are open to to to talk to to to have to buy fine [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nNo I Will tell you something that was really odd and and I don't think she's listening but my prom date\nWas a young lady who still lives here in the actual she's been married to the same guy for twenty nine years an absolutely wonderful wonderful person has a great fan of great husband and I I met him and um but um I went I went to prom I guess my mom was so thankful that some girl actually saying well yeah [laughter]\nShe should have a light on ... on ... here\nAnd press that in my high school annual\nI that's lovely and that's you know it's a special absolutely I I was odd all the way around\nAnd watch what I was trying to tell you a few segments ago as\nBeing mean growing up is why I'm thankful\nFor the developmental stage is that I had growing up I was the most bullied picked on kid in school for our first grade\nAll the way to junior high school\nAnd then in junior high school I said no this isn't this isn't going to happen anymore and I'm\nWon't go into it but there was a an incident that occurred on ... number two eighty five on the second day of school in ninth grade that prohibited me from ever participating in the ... school of public transportation system again why oh why is good but from that point on I was never bullied again ever\nEver\nBecause they feel clearly you use your brain to cause some kind of trauma to these individuals who had been no I used to lean on you know I use my attention so that they left you alone\nNow I used my entire summer that my mother shoveled me off to the dough Joe to learn taekwondo\n[laughter] to to hold yourself tangle amount of the window to hold a young\nMan's fingers up in front of his face and compound break them in front of his face oh oh oh you did go I guess or is a reason they don't like you pack on that but [laughter] yeah if you know what a compound fracture is that's where the bone actually comes through the skin yeah um\nBut at that point in time nobody messed with me anymore and I I appreciate the fact bullying is a part of life ... had I not stood up for myself at that point in time if God Knows what it would have been like in tenth grader eleventh grader twelfth grade so\nIf we're talking about bowling can we talk about the bullying we saw with this was a terrible disgrace at our capital yes this week\nYeah and we looked at the bullying went on
