Oh thanks for the other ... on hold for a day and a half years so what more can I Do it for you today but\nAre you are the manhole that's why I saw that you've you've been on hold so long and actually cycled over the whole time so am I wanted I wanted to\nSee that that I think we're being a little rough on that Kathy because I kind of think she's saying ladies with cells that red carpet skill it where you can melt the Saturn\nI Love that ... that's the greatest in Marshall ever ...\nA little bit\nI call them originally about the fellow who ... who was who was pled guilty to lying to the FBI he's the Senate staffer who was leading to his girlfriend up in New York Times so my question to you is and I know you're talking about different things that are going on in the background yeah my question is\nIs there a grand jury is this guy will you know he only played out to lying you know he did more than live we know elite that a felony if the in front of a grand jury\nWell or here here's here's what I find interesting about wolf\nWolf\nIs lawyer if you read back on some of the case documents waltz lawyer at one point had um put out there that in wall stiff\nAnd it's wolf's lawyer at one point had um put out there that in wolf's defense because remember Wolff wasn't charged with leaking\nWolf with sharks and for for folks for those those you have to understand what is a shame about James Watt for the Senate staffer on the intel committee that was handling Spygate investigation he was arrested by federal agents for lying about basically lying about leaking he wasn't arrested for leaking itself that's fascinating\nBecause in his defense his attorney was basically threatening to call her with his defense ... senators on the Senate intel committee why is that interesting and fascinating about the case because the wolf is charged with lying about leaking\nAnd his lawyer saying no no he's not lying we're going to call the senators in his defense what does that tell you folks that maybe the senators on the intel committee may have had some role in this selective leaking of information from the committee to the media to make\nTrump look bad that's why I find most cases fascinating wolf's case on one more thing about uh two\nPaul Wolff in the tax too is uh his girlfriend there who was working in writing stories for a couple of media outlets there's a fascinating series of tax where he text eighty two times\nTo his girlfriend the day they get a hold of the actual ... application what's fascinating about that\nThe five applications how many pages only two eighty year old brother eighty two pages meaning what meaning if significant pages were redacted which they are in the public document right\nHe didn't send her the actions he may he may have center the Henri that did find the application which means what means the media's had this thing the whole time they know this case is complete crap they hold it the whole time and there's still propagating this myth\nThat Donald Trump colluded with the Russians even though they've had the ... the application and they know it's crap does that make\nSo my question them take a little further um yeah we have a ... term coming up Trump held back releasing the redacted material the papers that the Congress but different Congress and wanted released it what what do you think and I know this is the kind of a it's not a fair question to you the endgame on this\nNow or whatever the washing their perfectly legit perfectly which are questioning\nMueller's winding down that's what they tell us anyway and Trump has all the all the bullets in his holster what the endgame is there a grand jury are they're going\nTo I'm going to give you a difficult but true answer here is All right now about leverage Paul do view of the Mueller probe is a criminal investigation it's not it is ... ... it has criminal authority I get that I'm not trying to be silly\nThe Mueller probe is a political investigation designed to damage Donald Trump\nDonald Trump's approval numbers are going up mothers approval numbers are going down why expand all of your tactical political ammo by de classifying now I Know it's not a convenient answer I Know that\nBut I'm what I'm suggesting job so I get on the run ball I got to take a break for great question I'm simply suggesting to you in the audience here\nThat why expand the political capital of the classified now if you don't need it\nWait until after the midterms Donald Trump's approval is going up my everybody knows mothers which is which on their approvals going down not a convenient answer I get it I'm just trying to tell you folks don't sell Trump short I think he's playing this tactically very smart right now\nRight up there but you

proof that she has a Native American identity [noise] setting is she has appeal [noise] be Republican\nAlso known as cannon fodder in the Massachusetts Senate race what happened happened Massachusetts once upon a time not all that long ago there were some semblance of prime into Elizabeth Warren\nAnd at this point here is the question Jeff deal the Republican in this race has been trailing by an average somewhere in the neighborhood about twenty five points or any chance that the backfires enough to move the needle even reasonably Jeff I ended up calling today\nHere's enough to move the needle even reasonably Jeff I ended up calling today with worn to drop out on\nThe back of her being Pocahontas in her entire tests backfiring on her quite spectacularly but you take a look and I mean not to project anything on to the good folks with questionable voting habits in Massachusetts right now\nBut I take a look at at New Jersey we got a senator Menendez they he still leaning in the ... what happens what does it take you actually have to be inside of a jail cell before\nYou will not be voted for if you're a Democrat in Massachusetts or or Jersey or what happened people come on now and got to be some sense left in there somewhere so anyway ah Jeff deal uh everybody should have been gay because for many including potentially with some folks in Massachusetts might be the first time you've even heard the guy's name but he's trying to give 'em credit\nBy the way I Am by muddy inform article that gives me and Brian my radio and talking about the fund that the president has had on back of Elizabeth Warren's botched rollout of protests probably\nThat those high cheekbones she talked about really had something to do it by president out winning today said Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIs getting slammed she took a bogus DNA tests and it showed that she may be one and one thousand and twenty four Indian is what he's referring to their far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA tests as useless even water phoney\nAnd you can do any do you want done there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being Indian up ... Indian heritage that turn out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public\nHarvard called her a person of color amazing God and would not have taken her otherwise and again this is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal it's not just oh it's another politician line it's not that\nOne it is a lie it is a fraud but she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud for personal gain every single step of the white educationally professionally she even went in because they had a couple of steps along her career path\nNews either league institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always refer to it had it would have a change that she was Native American or a person of color [laughter]\nSeriously seriously\nBut in the president's still isn't done he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him in and hear him saying that to king is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight from the tribe that she claims to be part of\nA kind of tough for her to rally back from that one by the way the the president in terms of choice holy cow he had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels\nNow to be a way forward to was I guess horse face\n[laughter] that that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit later in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whatever that says three point O.\nBetty is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president when you know\nThe United states has strongly and formed a president upon doors but at the large caravan of people heading to the U. S. is not stopped and brought back to endorse no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affected immediately well thank you this is one thing I've never understood about foreign aid\nWhy is it that we give foreign aid to countries this girl is\nOver and over and over and the case ... we give them a billion and a half bucks per year\nBillion and a half books ... government for [noise]\nSo

I like the the thing that really frustrates me that the young young thinking curse and the white cat or these politicians make their careers based on their own Barrett on their own talent on their own wisdom or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it it's\nPretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a main\nAmen brother [laughter] this is one of my my all time favorite called quite honestly it Twenty one years of doing radio this is the moment that makes my heart saying you're twenty two year in science and you're in Washington

to my parents you know yeah there are a lot of me and I just have frustrate you need more ah the word pedigree\nIs actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics and it's because people don't really see the difference between Arnold and people\nThat I think though that where you pedigree for people that are in a more ah\nOver in harm's way of a sad song you and me baby and nothing but mammal anyway or that amazing Josh I mean really\nA long list view and spread your wisdom to many people as possible board knows we could use it they're a great call great gal All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois All right Peter I uh I it's a tough act to follow so you've got to up your game that was a pretty impressive called there\nWhen you were talking about the brain that voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that the same people who after Kennedy left a woman to drown and the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate [laughter]\nYou raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well all to Billy his presidential bid and bad points and ... you're right if you could also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know what I defer to the vet is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing and the end it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the glass name people will think\nThat uh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I am not I'm not a somewhere in the very ah outer lying to a bar or a genetic silver pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one\nInfamous member of the family but I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix boots flag and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to go and\n... and that's the story for different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be the Republican guys now\nMay both signed up to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job at magic bad bad thing actually has some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it got like you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter their\nCaptain peanut it'll friendship because that was my nickname for him in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept and being in fact one of my uh favorite parodies from many years ago was that I remember the mountains and all I'm enjoying commercials\nYou know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... he's like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is that you could throw in there are so anyway it's just a as an aside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo want to win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so that story at least was happily ever after for the country not too heavily I ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate ah because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right so a couple of things here\nWhen we are taking only three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently pointed out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you probably heard me say things like there are two sides to stories that are one side to facts tend to be pretty a\nParticular about the facts you know you don't get it's kind of like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because while you're not\nRight so you can't you would that that would embrace of false premise which then takes me to the premise of the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have the moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are well if you're an eight even on a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than a five therefore when you're ... going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit\nWell then you bring it to somebody like ah oh I don't know\nElizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one of us both warn\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody's not just that she's wanting to commit fraud it's that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again\nNot a victimless crime because somewhere many times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought of it actual Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral under sliding scale morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody\nFor your own personal benefit ah so you put it all together two sides of stories one side of the facts the premise and the Saudis scale morality ultimately get is that yes Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to was Pocahontas\nIs\nA bad person who was pretty amoral and again two sides to stories one\nSet of facts if you want to be the person who defense\nAnd again two sides to stories on side effects if you want to be the person who ... fans taking this a lot of the actual Native American and you can justify that bringing on we'll have that conversation\nAnd we'll also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it well get

him walking out so either he's still in there somewhere or he's bad I'm actually the only explanation for it and there was any of them are leaving the facility I think common sense tells you the Saudis were the producer who did it how they did it I think we have to assume the worst and we'll see\nThey are pretty straightforward Marco Rubio kind of laying it\nOr a friend formerly known as that Jamal cause soggy alright so as the situation plays out I laid the groundwork by saying probably the greatest thing\nAnd I lay the groundwork by saying probably the greatest accomplishment of all of the Trump Administration is actually the one we think about the least day to day because we're not dealing with the problems you every day we see the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we kind of forget that yeah you know what we didn't used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had those problems are played\nBy the way I'm not superstitious I'm not trying to jinx anybody here but guess what that does that mean that they don't happen around the world I referenced Shorty law we got some problems here there was a real education that I undertook after we went into Iraq\nSo I uh I went along with the narrative that hey you know uh yeah I mean Afghanistan's to target the outcome of bin Laden but hey we we know that ah\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense in the people that could be afraid they're gonna want to be free not understanding all of the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the source and read the

the way we do a you die and by whatever means necessary\nThe groundwork ultimately the groundwork ... now you have is our practice obviously many different sects stumbled which are opposite if\nBush is not true law in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that sharia laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to demand that if a woman is raped for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rapists\nAnd just details you know that if you're a homosexual it's why I always liked about the ... come out I don't understand Israel for for you left is\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets down because you are homosexual or you know these days they they they just got a ... sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever it was a part of the problem\nIn us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty eight team\nThink about it for a second got number\n... ... one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought to just today for example and Molly you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown up by\nIslamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan U.S forces citizens that were bombs by the Taliban you probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man that attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably\nDidn't know about that even sometimes in countries like France it doesn't get reported over here [noise] there's a lot more to that story short he is at the root of it I guess one\nStill tenets of that in Saudi Arabia\nOr the situation becomes that much more complicated\nWe'll continue the conversation was just getting going on in my head for the great one mark\n\nListening to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done David absolutely right I truly love my ex chair and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the extra provides\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ... chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ... chairs on sale now for a one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L. E. V. I. N. dot com\nOr call us at one aid for for for\nI've been here since I was about eight years old\nOkay and uh how old you know or ... right now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states as a child and an adolescent to to today what what's changed in the end what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too but overall work what people will have in this country if you're like oh let me let me just say this but the privileges\nYou're like oh let me let me just say for the privilege of the ... everything that people were having this concrete all are a lot a lot of the most if not everybody on the Democratic party except for graft or\nYou know ... ... ... ... it's frustrating because\nWhat I what I remember when the first couple of our for credit all everybody already celebrities hearing all we're going to leave this country who are\nFighting ever do they always say and they never do it so it is how\nI Would love to cook my recovery has power ... what's his name after next partner\nFor your for your show on happy I'd look the currents park\nWell Colin Kaepernick is white making way too much money being the role the victim who who sacrificed everything making what about asking me to a hundred million dollars oh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victim status\nAnd Isaac I appreciate the call into perspective you know it's interesting\nI'm Aaron ... filling in for more calls then by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it is part of the reason by the way you have a lot of folks that get Florida elections wrong because you'll have some of these uh pollsters oriental is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and they see that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to pray for Democrats at this present\nWell hold on hold on\nFor just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interest in all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented Mexico yes you do have\nSouth and Central America but it's also represented one of the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was indicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and its options for example if someone's here on DACA ... they probably are an Obama type a Democrat and they don't like Donald Trump ...\nWell not not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the\nPeople and I've found far more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states true immigrants bell wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than they the Democrats have been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks you have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to why this economy can do what the United States economy is capable of\nThey didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then the Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah get ... can same deal with a lot of\nHispanics a lot of different backgrounds\nA lot of folks that want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to one more of that is that what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards them\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the midterm elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the ... elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans in the United States House their districts twenty six and twenty seven and for them\nAnd district twenty six you had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the curtain representative who's a Republican win by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen\nThat one happened in other parts of the country right\nI mean the the there are too many people it's just both the ticket if you're ... for Hillary Clinton how close you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally again what I was just mentioning not as\nA conventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought ... would have you think there's a lot more to the store and we start talking about Hispanics and immigrants do want a better life\nAnd district twenty seven you have Hillary Clinton had been one that district by twenty points twenty points and you had\nThe retiring Ileana Ross lightened when that district by ten\n... the difference here and that's why it's important\nTo break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many folks do not support the left in what they've been doing from the immigration stance or in in many folks that are here on DACA rather disproportionate number one in South Florida I've talked to a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me to task Ryan in San Francisco go\n... a day you you mentioned that you know ... people who smoke\nPot or all the um and whatever it or not or are not educated or not why and then he kinda\nCame across that I made a stereotype about it yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ball on are are are on the right to do with it\nI I work my ass off I actually got a good um you know I got my crime is back from\nThere [laughter] ah there you are the land and empty boys yeah\n... exactly right and I'm going to vote read up and down ticket\nAmen brother I'm actually going to look into all my city council people now and me and asked them 'cause I only got Twenty one days left so\nGot to get going God Bless you brother and a duly noted duly noted I did make kind of a a nasty stereotype about that do smoke and folks and and maybe or how they would vote so I have this is a really interesting show we're having here because\nManaged to have a twenty two year old biology student last hour from Washington DC which by the way Ninety One percent of Washington D. C. votes for Democrats and and he is a\nThoughtful pragmatic conservative and now we've got someone who is a you know and the ball from San Francisco\nAnd he's a conservative I mean you know moving mountains and is your your Donald Trump Republican Party it's a kind of interesting chemical alright I'm mud in for the great one month\nHere data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they're putting you at risk and now you add in all the crux since cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family to why I switched to my\nId care for identity protection they're the best in the business for plant starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nId care offered say one hundred percent money back recovery guarantee you can sign up at my\nId cared dot com slash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now they're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my\nId carried dot com slash mark and our promo code mark learn more and then let my id care take care of you my id care dot com slash Mario Cuomo called mark that's my id care dot com slash marks enter ...\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one fell gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that's\nSignificant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why men to share is so popular vote and that is shared dot com recall\nStar star five five six that star star five five six messaging data rates may apply call star star five five six the", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "16"}
