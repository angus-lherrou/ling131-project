I'm I'm just curious to find out what time is there is going to run for next 'cause he's had everyone the elected position that's available accept governor um\nMaybe he'll create one yeah he might make up his own I'm you know\nKing king ... um but you know\nThere's so many little stories that fly out there and the reason why it just comes to mind for for the Craig airport runway extending than it is because it\nSeems so logical you know there's no no more property has to be purchased and the federal government would pay for Ninety five percent of the money the other five percent would come from usage fees by the pilots their acts\nI ... percent of the money the other five percent would come from usage fees by the pilots that are actually going there right the motors on these airplanes have gotten quieter and the last Thirty years the motors have gone to half of all and they used to be yet the aircraft won't be any larger\nAnd you know for five years I've been pitching and pitching in Beijing about this one particular issue because it's close to hard for me but also\nIt's because of the political corruption that that is behind it the political corruption that's behind the fact that we have this overlay that prevents the runway from being any longer ... I mean\nWhat other business is they're out there that that the government tells you you can't expand\nThat you can't do better that you can't make more money that you can't\nHire more people the the folks that are around the airport there which see an increase in the property values of their homes and\nBusinesses like the little mini Mart and gas station right outside the entrance to the airport which she increased revenue from the fact that more people would be buying gas there more people would be buying snacks there there might even be restaurants I mean apple ...\nApplebee's wanted to build a restaurant there and then realize that the airport was being stagnated by the powers that be so what do they do they move their restaurant over to Jay TB but\nI'm ruby Tuesdays\nIs it really to know what's um what's the other one that's right there on monument road\nI think it would be to disagree with you that they wanted to build their restaurant on the other corner and they did not because they knew that the airport was being stagnated eight it's these little back office like Matt was saying that candidates have to sign a petition saying that they won't vote in favor of it before it was like\nI did it or ... I think I I think those are as well and then she just got to have had all the\nPeople who who who vowed that they will they will they will run against you or they will they will they will work against you and you'll never get elected again and we will do this and we'll do that and and\nYou know certain among those sort of like the childish groups of people that go into restaurants and scream and crews are those the restaurant or a ...

books on subjects just like this book and it doesn't saying it doesn't speak it it sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it\nAnd uh your books are not that way and and I really am glad that you've taken the time to write them because we all need someone to hold her hand to walk us through the scriptures that's what this is\n... thank you and you know when I was in this position maybe I said it's for I don't think I did but um\nI I feel like I'm I Wish I had someone when I was first hungry and learning I Wish there was a short cut I Want to consume I Want to inhale the Bible and the theological knowledge\nAnd and I don't know how to do it I just groped around I kept finding I kind of did it the hard way get studying things and I think I have I Do think I have a gift to discern where I can kinda tell what's out there and what's mainstream what's reliable side but I think I've been blessed with that\nPay their taxes show I'm sitting here with David Limbaugh who continues to write these marvelous books the new one is Jesus is ribs and Paul in the early church\nAnd and David my first question in the segment is what do you need to do this show for your friends with Sean Hannity he has you on the show and the book goes to number one so what what do you why you're wasting your\nTime you should just be writing another book back home [laughter] I mean do you live a ... journal Missouri You live in Missouri still I Love it here in Missouri man\nYes Sean's awesome great friend rush helps me mark well then they all helped me a and I've been blessed you have a unique perspective a unique style interview and your cerebral you bring up things that nobody else that I don't know is this a pay that\nYeah that was just going to say I I'm I'm listening this is pretty good I better shut up\nBut I told I told Lauren that that's not my daughter Laurent with regular I told you that before this half the interviews or a male\nYou know speaking of ... is the publisher of your book reading or he's also the publisher of my book\nIt's called Donald drain the swamp and I'll tell you something I spent months\nThinking about writing that book and I spent an afternoon writing that book and it is a fable and I think John is going to have me on his program to talk about that you'll see when you read it because it's actually a\nIt is so shallow that anybody can understand that but it's really stupid and it's really fun but ... is the publisher so we share a publisher we share a face yeah uh we were both the kids in Missouri actually that's not true I was in camp but we're both kids\nAnd here we are in the same room with one of the odds of this it's unbelievable in our world credible okay so your book you were just going on to say that but the the figure in this book because it talks about Paul Saint Paul in the early church\nThis takes us really from the gospels into act right yes so suddenly Jesus is crucified he is a\nResurrected from the dead forty days later he a sense to heaven and then everybody standing around thinking okay now what do we do like a he's gone he's resented into having we know we rose from the dead we many of us saw him we talked to him but\n... ... ... then we enter what's called the early church and that's what your book talks about is like weird did what happened in those years I'm forty BC fifty bc as Paul and Peter and the other apostles kind of fan out through the early world I'm a ... of that day um\nAnd we're at the point where you said Paul this incredible prosecutor Christians is on a horse on his way to Damascus he's causing a lot of trouble people are scared to death of this guy\nAnd he's blinded by the light knocked off of his horse and basically has the ultimate conversion experience\nYes by the way you said forty BC fifty what\nYou mean eighty we've got to make sure the readers don't never correct me and my radio show yeah sorry uh somebody that I'm Sorry forty eight the ladies and gentlemen and no dome in the ... year the lord okay and so yeah\nYeah so So Paul ... is one of the greatest apologetic ... moments or evidence is that Paul who is this a persecuted ardent believer of our our ... this labor of Christianity becomes the greatest convert and Christ commission seemed to be the apostle to the gym tiles\nAnd the judge has means be non Jews and non Jews and yeah it is are they call them in the Bible Greeks can you relate to that you know isn't that interesting is they they like limit Greeks the thing and and it says but no it says in Christ there's neither Jew ... nor Greek gifts but only lithuanians [laughter] and\nThat's a lotta manuscripts who didn't look into it you know but isn't that interesting that that\nPaul was appointed specifically\nTo speak to those outside of of the Jewish community now daddy doesn't mean that he didn't speak to people in the Jewish community to convince them that Jesus as messiah but he was specially commission to go to those who were not part of the Jewish community who did not go to synagogue and they say to them oh by the way\nThe God that we Jews have worshiped\nIs now available to you through Jesus and God chose the Jewish people to bring a faith in him to the whole world and now the time has come that everybody\nHim to the whole world and now the time has come but everybody beyond the world of of the Jews Kimball leaving the God of the Jews through Jesus he's the bridge and the time is now I mean it's it's pretty amazing\nPretty amazing and and also amazing and as told in this book which is about the Bible\nThat Paul always retained his heart for the Jews for his people and he tries tries to convince them of the authenticity of this message in of Jesus Christ and that he is really the messiah and backed the book of Romans\nIn part as a lament he's suffering so much agony over the idea that he can't convince so many of his\nJewish brothers that Christ is the messiah\nAnd and he talks about ultimately Jews coming around by the way I don't want to offend any do I believe that\nUh we believe that Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament and not the abolition of it or not the abolition of the old cabinet but the fulfillment of it and ... of the New Testament of a continuation of the Old Testament completes the picture\nBut I think that Christians authentic Christians have a heart for Jews and we don't we everybody has the same under Christ and you just said there's no Greek there's no ... ... everybody is offered this gift of salvation and\nPaul is you see the agony as he writes ah to the early churches who are deviating from the message\nAnd you see what a raw human being who he is\nAnd he and he was writing just like it's today because of human beings and human nature hasn't changed in two thousand years\nWe're falling people made in God's image which is another paradox and yet fall and Paul rights and pleased with these churches that he found that he feels like there but he gave birth to them in a literal sense and that his kids are\nGoing off the path and he wants to bring 'em back in a disciplinary sense to the true word of God not for his benefit but for their ... and they also will become ambassadors to other Christians and and producers and multiples in that sense throughout the Roman empire and throughout the world in history and so this is a story these missiles pause\nWriting these people like the same problems we've ... experience today they're they're they've got falls teachers coming in their ... puffed up on their own false stories trying to build their own legal or maybe maybe demonic Lee inspired to get people off the gospel\nBut in their ... their in disarming in their churches there they're making a mockery of the lord supper and fighting and he's telling given a practical advice practical mundane advised to how they get back\nTo the spiritual practices and then he's also in getting very lofty as to Christian doctrine and he this is preserved these words scripture when he wrote him over the world but nobody knew it right and they're preserved their letters to individual churches are individuals\nAnd now they are preserved by God's Providence to become letters for all Christians so that we can be\nFBI isn't is amazing I mean I I always want to say 'cause I Know there's somebody out there listening who doesn't know when Christians talk about the book of Romans or the ... whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul\nUh is traveling around the ancient world\nCreating churches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here and here and hearing here but then he keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he is not just like oh let me just down if you know these thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains\nTo school them in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you said there's practical stuff 'cause he hears about arguments about communion or this or that\nAnd he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing it in another parallel thing\nIt's grounded in actual history just like\nThe entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as bodily resurrection so here's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit a empowerment\nHe's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice and doctrine not knowing that they're old I'm only going to be available to us pray in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was gonna say that's what's so cool is that when you say in a transcendent away when he was writing them as you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that is that I'm just writing to the specific group of people either in Rome or in a colossus or in a ... show or one of these places he's writing to them\nBut the way he wrote God used it\nTo reach Christians for ever and ever and ever it becomes the word of God\nAnd uh I I Do think that that's such a beautiful thing because\nIt transcends time I mean it exist in time as a piece of history and yet it transcends time because guess what it is the word of God before we go to the break I Want to remind you folks this week only we have a two for one sale going on

survey Emily would look at\nYou know we were talking about the topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early ... thousands of where people were asked to kill his list of identity is which one is the most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion that political party the email is really a with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and and you know we were so surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past\nA religion ranked really really highly for a lot of people that want to open a prominent things ah you know threats and people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life wakes highly\nAnd politics and like all the way down at the bottom left this list and we sort of suspected that perhaps he repeats something different if we ask people this question again debate because feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics politics there's like a pro bathing everything around out there\nAnd so we we surveyed the question asked about two thousand people and found once again the politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of asked this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nBut it's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves that that's constantly you know those of us who write about these things are letting that most people out in America are not as obsessed with that if we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time
