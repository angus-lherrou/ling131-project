[noise]\n\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen it's the really is a privilege and I say that and I truly mean if they have Rhonda scientists the\nRepublican running for governor of Florida on this program I have been a fan of his since the day was elected I watched him work in the house of representatives he is solid he has enormous integrity he's a he's an Iraq vet the very smart guy graduated from Harvard and he's so smart and um [noise]\nAnd he's taken the lead on so many issues that are important to this country Rhonda scientists how are you my friend\nI'm doing great mark how're you doing\nI'm doing fine you know I watch this debate last night with your opponent Gillum and I got to say this before we get into substance he is a very nasty guy I mean the ... he turns to you and he must have called you a liar twenty times uh he uh he he just said some incredibly snarky things\nI'm a [noise] he uh he just said some incredibly snarky things and I thought to myself this guy's cocky he thinks that he has it in the bag and I suspect he does not mean and what did you make of the debate\n... book I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously\nYou know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree to it or not and so I'm somebody who is running on keeping Florida low tax said he wants to massive pack\nAnd forced men he's running saying that we should abolish ice and so there are different obviously it's huge policy differences but and the governor's race of instead of like a senator house race\nIt's more than just about your position because about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think his whole performance backfired\nI think a lot of people that then looked at me and they obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country I'm not I guess that they are the easy decisions that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things that's very very troubling to me knowing you now for several years\nYou lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nYou succeeded along with the president along with our her wonderful and bashed her Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you supported by neo Nazis when in fact are the biggest voice for the state of Israel in the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just ... about all I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by this\nRadical left wing group would dream defenders but he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical Minnesota so they have 'em and this group dream defenders wanted there remains a things is boycotting Israel bbs\nThey say Israel genocidal apartheid state so that's the group he stands with he will not disavowed which group that is who he is and I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriffs\nIn Florida right give them a letter asking him to get some garbage or you can get from those because uh the pledge that Gillum signed\nA said that police in prison have no place injustice they want to abolish\nAre basically traditional law enforcement get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women are in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge restricted by that and\nAnd that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for him to say that I I think it was um I think it was a total forest and that's the thing voters are sicker people on the left or just lashing out like that folks and I think it really backfired big time [noise]\nYou know when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion\nAny signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers outta prisons and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement and your point was this\nOne is a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the fetch who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically his position\nYeah I asked him on Sunday nights they will you honor a dictator request they're called ... when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out a program\nWhere you want a dictator requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do that and so if you say oh I don't want criminals on the street without the matter is he pledged not to cooperate with by\nThis idea that all he wants to do is move it under the Justice Department mark you know about him trying to backtrack office position you know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I speak like they want open borders that is what the far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like administrative tweak a heated lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon ... dot com\nOr we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentlemen runs being big time outspent\nDisguise Soros behind them he's got Styron behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups are targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency in the future and they're getting behind a true Bernie Sanders George Soros\nPeople for the American way which is so he works for radical when we come back I Want to ask Ron to censor certain FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it while they write back\nAnd\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimal got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved him thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends at optimal tax relief\nAnd run to send to see immediately tried to racialized suspicious that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any truck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American and and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking female Hispanic I'm a history of Florida government\nMm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean when you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather your own mess like games or did\nThey mapped the problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just a the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits\nBy tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling his pay\nA and so he wanted people to have a happy to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway for illegal activity like accepting the Hamilton ticket and turning around and giving these guys the deal they want it\nAnd he worked for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that I thought very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing may say they pay Andrew Gillum this has while he was mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year\nTo work forty hours a week well the mayor of Tallahassee is a fulltime job so how how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case he neglected to people Tallahassee which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most that they have the highest crime rate in Florida or\nHe ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confusing but the nation is in the Floridians are too [noise] you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way Santa by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think that would be the question is their\nPeople for the American way that that was an exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to them but if he was working forty hours a week for them\nTo make the people tell me feel you know they have the guts out of control crime problem he's raising the taxes he's doing all these gangs\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either way but it's interesting even though the documents are out there um journalists do not pursue got at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk\nYou know they try to do a do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the crap\nI Want to hit to other things before you go and then is health care and Texas\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone on a stone employer in private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now with some theories some ... some concoction they'll create or Washington DC will have the science is the system whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears\nAnd what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think for about three hundred million people\nThe two things that Bernie has built keeps our the VA in the Indian Health service so now I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so his response is when I called them out on this was basically to act like\nHe didn't know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we of senior citizens who have their arrangements they'd been paying into Medicare Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he would take all of that way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know\nWill cause tax increases it will bankrupt ah it'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor that's going to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that\nYou're not going to find a doctor it's got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting wind and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can um even though in the primary he would gang that that's the way that you win win in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nThat talk about let me talk about let's hit taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states is you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy and such a diverse economy in Florida and I have a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between a no tax income tax state and I have a home and I my primary residence and Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making it says I've never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw it in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders and income tax he supports an income tax and in truth doesn't he\nSo there was a study a nonpartisan study an analyzed all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was here in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax of thirty eight percent\nOr impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes where he would be able to pay for good you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cost so you go down that road a Florida is done that but now I mean they were totally cripple our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen at all\n[noise] Fifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure all the cities at trying or what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who are punished because what happens\nIs people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even change can't afford it and so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose temps I mean this doesn't help people actually mandating at Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequence doesn't\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I worked all these jobs for six bucks an hour\nThrough college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it all of his policies were in place I Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero\nBecause I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down there that says to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned\nA lot of the people who who who kept their job they did get a pay increase to Fifteen they still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduce quite a bit but\nSo it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he ... he doesn't care and that's what he's running are\nParticularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job same with his open borders policies that particularly harms another skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals [noise]\nBut uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people run dissent us\nOnce again what is your site America we have all of in search let's give all the support we can to run to scientists\nIn Florida let's increases ground game there and the grassroots there where people go if they want to help you\nRon be Santas
