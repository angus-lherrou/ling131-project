this in this space but other things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught\nUm outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we've seen of the devices mark\nYou the uh just hallmarks of of of of just the rookie type behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the beep pronounce hype\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to create a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male handle or the target\nYou don't use hype that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan at CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious the basic Internet search would have produced that information he worked at NBC which I mean this is it it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\n[noise] well let me ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded worked if somebody wants to look so amateurish\nWell it's certainly possible I said there's only one of two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or its amateurish that it ... it speaks to some kind of a motive we haven't yet the fifth\nIt it it speaks to some kind of a you know motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd in the selection of the of the targets um you know of course there's people want to you know if people all over the media right now are given out these ... especially if you're going through these other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive to have no idea\nBut I Would encourage all of them they take this very very slow or because I when I what I see mark in my experience in the space especially with the secret service and all of this mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have the Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient in the way they do it and none of the ... marks of tactically efficient up planning where you are in this is a highly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that\nCertainly doesn't speak the stomachs expertise in this in this space\nTo investigator and you're looking at this I Would think you would make no a imagines a scenario that you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and figure it out that way rather than\nWhile this mode of that motive and the other motives really you're you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you and I do um we're always hesitant to jump to a motive before we actually have the facts and the data there I mean this is what comments that reasonable people do\nBut of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark the most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how\nTheir most important thing obviously has to get it who the actual person it we'd have no we have zero close right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of the initiate are on these devices which usually leads the signature\nThat they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is and I got to tell you it's grotesquely irresponsible for these people out there already were absolutely convinced\nThat that they they know exactly why this happened it's just it's it's been than it\nIs not you also find it a really gut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they try and tied to Donald Trump\nNow rose Donald Trump yesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable TV [noise] he was said to be a racist multiple times on cable TV because they use this word nationalist and I'm going to explain this later in the show\nI'm aware that where it actually comes from comes from the progressive actually comes from Theodore Roosevelt as new nationalism speech but I don't want to jump out and getting into that later just shows you how ignorant people are but they were going on and on and and now these same\nHosts the same guests the same contributed call them whenever you will are talking about the rhetoric too hot things need to be coal do they understand the media have led this this this battle with the vicious rhetoric\nMark they've they've accused the man\nOf being a Russian trader a a a guilty of trees and we've had we've had so called air quotes you respected commentators accused a man of treason accusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces mark what other things you\nSean and the people in this industry of always been clear on on the conservative side of the people responsible for their own actions\nThat maniac who shot up his needs college and the baseball field\nI that guy's responsible for his own action\nBut having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation of public have to be more responsible but that's not conservative than the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make some kind of a political issue without having any band hounding factors disgusting ...\nOne of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during a campaign some French saying Felipe whatever his name is this guy yesterday on TV I think it was on TALK shows refused to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and other public officials in restaurants that was just yesterday\nI heard it I saw the exact same what you're talking about but that's who he is the fate of him before mark ... who he is I was not surprised one time my brother well we appreciate having you on then you're great friends God Bless you we'll be right back\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one that just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to net is share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month I\nThink what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nSignificant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why and met a share is so\nDangerous word nationalist so very very dangerous or you got to listen to me throughout the program I'm going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead\nWe know this president is\nAll I Do want to be precise on Congress or in your ... your ...\nBetween the primary in the United states and Hitler and I want you to explain exactly what you mean 'cause obviously this is a this is controversial what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and a naturalist meaning that you know when you listen to him he was talking about in Germany for the germ is a and that\nI'm On\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans\nThese are\nHistorically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nServing historical echoes somebody well founded ... a lot of things over the years\nIn the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with liberal movements people I figured our hearts of the founders ... who helped to create the fair to pedal error fall of our who helped to create those sites of Columbia in Venezuela\nBut on the twentieth century nationalism is taking on a much darker much more negative connotation being associated with a sense of fascist movements and you think of national it seems like a people I'd Franco and we were selenium Hitler and\nPinochet so we're not exactly people at the president of the United states which I mean I've been waiting and that's why it's very hard for me to think of people he was so straight for the describe themselves as nationalist is not a popular term\nWith Kay okay well I'll explain one very big one who was in the ... century in a moment and then we have Joe Scarborough really low some really low some individual cut Nineteen go want to read this this is\nKind of a this is this

I'm telling you the truth I rejection of the declaration of independence has written a rejection of the separation of powers that confines the ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was on the radio on my left on the progressive left but new nationalism\nSo\nWhy do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler what do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be that's a progressive term that progressive said oh my word in the twentieth century\n\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory Meeks is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\n\nThis is a phrase a word\nThat is central to understanding progressive ... and the central is Asia and the American government they're
