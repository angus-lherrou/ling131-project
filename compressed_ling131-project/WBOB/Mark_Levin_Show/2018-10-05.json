his doubles you'll be [noise]\n\nYou know one of my dearest friends [noise] one of\nThe smartest floors I Know one of the nicest people I Know as David Limbaugh and he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus risen\nNow this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book is as I say Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this area of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point\nI was a young adult I wasn't really a believer I I was always believed in God but I I didn't quite embrace the God of the Bible until I really\nStarted studying it and and I had to overcome some obstacles that are over overcome some doubt\nAnd when I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was so in all of that so ... that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I wished at that time\nThat there were some short cut but there are some a guide some parameters that would help me get a hold of a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did it takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile\nMore quickly than I did takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform hadn't written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere it was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I had written all those columns two columns a week every week and I got five books under my belt and I thought well now the platform I've got a little more confidence\nUh and I might just a try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book and again\n... explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then for men I've just gone on to write other books on the last one was a book about the gospel or where I go through the gospels and explain what the text is in a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order\nAnd then uh also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian thinkers and some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book\nAnd it has a history of the early church\nAnd shakes of Paul's Thirteen of pistols his letters to the early church it's\nSo that's what this book is just a continuation of a my a trek through the New Testament a and I've got more to go and the next book of ... my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer the question is I was on fire but the Bible remain on fire\nThe Bible study that really pretty hard for a lay person or the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion you help people where I was Hoover who were doubters in wanting to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and Anna deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question when you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways you look in the middle east and same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah it is the third religion\nExist and Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews had of sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court in the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity [noise] do you think your book will help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realized there's in white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles a behind the constitution and our liberties\nAnd what our tradition stands for the Judeo Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image we believe where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from God that comes from our religious tradition\nAnd as a result of really believing that from the core of ourselves\nThat we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty at any one else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are and that that the U.S\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for for much atheist have nothing to fear from Islam as long as it doesn't attack us had nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the ... the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarian suppressor of free speech and liberty\nCome from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular left destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that that underlying under guard all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just have some Christian some passive Christian suggest we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth that he passed it by standard\nWe need to be active and there's nothing incompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the left as hard as they buy that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and isn't chance and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear for much we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nTo book is Jesus is written by David Limbaugh or you can get it at Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already mark ... show Facebook ... Twitter we have a link to it it is really a fascinating and um\nI went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I don't want you to come on and discuss your book and David is so respectful of other face and other beliefs and other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth\n[noise] and I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about this I'll tell you why David and we're going to come back in\nThirty seconds I see more vibrant some more rigorous alarm the Christians say better society is I feel the same way by my own religion Judaism and so let's discuss that a little bit when we come back we'll be right back\n\nTime we spend most of our time indoors so am I reading the outdoors and when you're inside kill with Congress sizes to choose from plus cost him option we have a solution to make your indoor air cleaner pressure

again\nYou don't want to mess with the IRS you have the power to garnish your ... your bank accounts and even take your home or business that's all true but thankfully they're offering a way out a fresh start initiative\nYou caught up all your files in the experts at much actually both fight to get you the best possible tax settlement and you have an a rating with a better Business Bureau to prove it called optimal for your free consultation\nOur nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform\nUs back to something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendencies of the last\nUh as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation but nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son of mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started\nAbout a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I won't say I'm an expert on this subject I won't even say I'm close to that but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how is how and then where do you go from here [noise]\nOkay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some on the Old Testament and I want to help\nReaders really understand the Bible so these this and I want to give them the historical perspective until the book of acts as the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say which is the history of the early church\nAnd then six of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he writes these forms the Iraqis letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey to the secular influence is just like we see today the secular influences a pagan city of corn which was\nDominated by a sexual immorality and I'd our trade from the\nMainly feature of the the love God of Africa ... and Paul would write to these churches in such a personal and intimate way saying look I formed us up I Would birth a baby and I told you the true gospel and here you are deviating listen to these listening to these\nTaken influences and following year left will desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there\nAnd then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living how to live right\nOut to be good moral people listen to the Holy Spirit\nOf a bay the Holy Spirit and then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctor and the Christian doctor and what's interesting markets this really happened in history and I want to give readers a sensor that history because\nWhen when they when they read it they will understand it really happened then although Paul wrote these letters to particular church as\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a ... to all of us\nFor the next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo they're of universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people at a specific point in time in history we've still profit from them today as a Christian lay their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just ... miraculous how this has occurred and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about God's word trying to sell a tape people's understanding advance their learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all it as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\nWell you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about over the years really are a [noise]\nA very well they cover a lot of territory

surprise\nAwake Lindsey Graham at the Atlantic and been in a deep the on Wednesday well yourself after is funny because here you had Cory Booker case Spartacus and and he told us he was having his part of his moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually wants to give up the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's like the Grinch in a different sense you know the Grinch his heart grew three ... three times a day\nLet's say that a Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times over the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think\nA new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many butts necessarily thought would be the case\nBuildings I Am very much based on information or the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always track on Supreme Court nominees and you may be a ... whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed the not the case of that's the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did\nComing out of that four percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed but not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by the by the fact that they uh you know what else Spartacus on them it didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nNow is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning not yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw about what's that image shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today but it's kind of interesting by a forty six to forty five marching Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as\nPublic opinion despite all the emotions all of the emotions the all the nonsense real Spartacus across the board to gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary boats to advance the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you\nWrite how does that work out for you and let me ask you\nFor the angry leftist but you argue politics worth you ever get anywhere and you just get angry\n[noise] do you think they're one of the folks just poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place [noise]\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in their lives and our universe\nBut he wants to be open minded folks coming up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and become really unhappy I Am Brian my man in the gray

good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this Kevin situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of say sexual assault may not be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and\nGo through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kavanaugh anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience a tells me why mark what attracts you to do to\nSpeak well of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in a very carefully to the Susan Collins senator Collins is a [noise] a dissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it\nShe laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and be able to see what her diligence all the time she had been getting a\nComing to her conclusions all the interviews he did and all all the meetings he wanted to go I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every\nSingle consideration that's part of this process I mean she was on both ... and point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out\nHow many organizations who are going to oppose regardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through\nPoint by point by point wind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of allegations even\nThough she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been the top attorney in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must to view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech\nNot ever I didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was detailed it was well thought out and almost everything there is inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWho goes down to money go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nThat by facts are that are pretty much echo what the last caller showed up about a murder suspect they're not ... percent of the callers I mean it's increased by water cold after ... girl gr sort of about ... minutes after that I knew her vote was going to be a year after I was thinking of driving down the road\nYou know the only other thing bigger than what Susan cultivated a today was when the ... the main rotor Josh what Chamberlain protected the ... ... your your army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the junior so I really admire her and I'm Glad she did she did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah yeah the skaters are kind of a rapid and big but ah ah so the cold weather gets in on her I think you're I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington\nRobert Charlotte but uh I was in the marine corps are facing over that area than I've ever read was pretty good bet recovering pretty good but Jacksonville your real various there all the water retreated and the cover of area so I talked to a friend over there everything's going back ... slowly but surely record normal\nAnd appreciate your service thank you for listening and sharing your thoughts as well may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time and when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island a pretty unimaginable so glad that ah folks starting to get back together\nAfter the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go to\nJake Jake than California Welcome to the show\nAlright alright yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about work it up ... and Ford and that fires are allegations are concerned but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future\nThat might think that they can set people up to put a a false allegations and not have to pay a price\nCorrect I think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a pass even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this thing that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegations regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principles\nAnd again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise that should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury and conduct investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go and check what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your or none of your witness a\nWould know the witnesses period that cooperate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country are pretty shady you are you listening in and check and then coming up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on break cabin on the situation as we get ready for the vote are

I. O. D. in Miami and always an honor and a pleasure to be here with you know one of the things about Susan Collins during the course of her dissertation\nYou might have found some moments where you're wondering huh\nBecause Brett Kavanaugh really conservative I thought he was the really the constitutional is I I thought it was I'm not so sure already but I mean that was held good her depiction of Brett Kavanaugh was how thorough investigation was\nAll the folks she interviewed I mean she laid it all out there just remarkable and uh you know it it might have some some questions about how he would end up rolling on things like say\nFor life matters\nAnd there is an important point within the pro life conversation here as well\nBrett Kavanaugh pretty evident being the\nGood a Catholic Boy that he is he's pro life right but does that necessarily mean that he brings that philosophy\nTo the bench and doesn't doesn't necessarily it has it as she pointed out based upon us some of what he has ruled on in stated previously\nAnd when we're traveling down this process you're learning things that you never would have otherwise known about Brett or about\nThe level of the investigation that took place with Susan but also what obviously was not done by so many other senators and this is where it's instructive\nFor you with the folks that are in your neck of the woods your senators how did they vote on here in Florida yeah Marco Rubio you voted in favor of ending debate today will vote for Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow got Bill Nelson he voted no\nBy all accounts will vote no again tomorrow night he happens to be up for reelection this year he's up against our term limited governor Rick Scott who has been no less than the third best governor\nDuring his seven plus years as governor and the state of Florida just remarkable what he's done\nA but he's in a real horse race against Bill Nelson who's already served three terms in the United States Senate in Florida it's gonna be fascinating to see how this Kevin ... plays out here what I'm looking at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gold things can change cabinet gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we could have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be seen\nBut we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court admission and then it goes to health care OK so after that which by the way does that change the dynamic at all so\nWe're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress survey because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh bet that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and what you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you are in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to win hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd the other way want to give you a heads up on something that you definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR\nIf you don't already have in life liberty and live

actually hurts her speech was scripted she did not speak like\nThe protests was written\nSo I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they write truthfully have towards them\nYou know take the anger directed that they ... have towards the end and less than\n... where I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment\nOr that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... seemed detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought ran afoul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got the sense that what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way in in throughout the process including as you pointed out with all of her other previous votes so\nI I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy dog process that Susan Collins he was not on the up and up I I really I got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine throughout her speech\nLet's go to Raj Raj is in Virginia and welcome to the show\nA little tank so much I Do appreciate your very strong emphasis on the insects in point I Believe the on that point but not tested in the political lady now in the financially you know even the head you know\nThat they could change the culture is increasing and those are all the trains and I'm looking at a strong herded rain\nOr the other point to mention to vote on doing more to protect our political system it has to do with what's happening locally in D.C who people know that the two large seats\nOccupied by two opposing party to both have to be the publications and that's why that's not the in D.C called collections or sway important ... tank you very much for that to sit for an ice cream cone heartedly with you\nI'm guessing the year as big of a door does I Am are you an analyst\n[laughter] I have been an engineer or my life\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was a of a a similar type of top processed anyway I Am not an engineer though not by a long shot I Can't even change a tire effective way just as my dad about that one [laughter]\n[laughter] that was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love what I Do uh but uh but the ya ya gotta weren't spiritual paths that way and uh when I ended ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey if we have history with information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just a financial markets for example so anyway ah good self pretty she had to rush\nLet's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\nGood afternoon near the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation but it was\nBut we felt pity we didn't feel anger I have no Adam is towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the\nDebauchery that the Democrats expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some re ... parents from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed and California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties\nNot necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is but the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with ... Seventy five percent of your point here I Do want to ask you specifically you say that you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that ah she did anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions her therapy sessions I don't know that some therapist or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMembers can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I I don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein what their bodies out day one\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that you have all the way to the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated to begin with and in charge of it\nShe knew that was another lose situation\n... as well as the board it she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been coerced into this mindset remember she's a professional on the field\nI I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored and and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled that out there went seriously\nThis is how you're attempting to establish our credibility as a witness I think it was one of those moments to where it's like okay\nWhat part of the tactic is near a bus but anyway on you know I I still feel she's kind of like you go under oath\nYou're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being ... by you know some a psychologist that these are the memories that you really had where was she of received all those names that she provided as the witnesses\nI mean that's difficult for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to to instill in her a I just\nCan't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and ah interesting thought All right I Am Brian mud in for the great one month\n\nYou know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart the zip recruiter dot com slash lives in L.
