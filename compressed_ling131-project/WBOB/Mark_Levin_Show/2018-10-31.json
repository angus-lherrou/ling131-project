and I'm paraphrasing but what happened\nAt the constitutional convention was that they couldn't push the issue of slavery as far as someone or to push it although some wanted to push it all the way

uh\nI Hope the folks in West Virginia understand when mansion comes home and he smiles and he shakes hands any any kind of does Lincoln and not about the liberals in Congress when he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nA and all these big votes you gotta sit breathless lay on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not is he's trying to figure out
