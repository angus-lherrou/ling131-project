entire\nPicture of the Mona Lisa done on her back from the tape of her neck to the top of her waist the entire Mona Lisa and it\nIt looked great it looked just like I was staring at the Mona Lisa but it was done in such a way so that her bright white bra strap went right through the center of the Mona Lisa his mouth kind of like a big piece of tape and and I had mentioned that\nOn a blog that I wrote ...

wrote it in a G happen to have read it and then he just went off\nOn polio which is a badge of honor believe it or not ... says I have and on the cover of it of which I have probably about thirty five or forty copies of it if you'd like to have a A N thought autographed copy I Know\nI'm not saying thank you he uh he put on there that I was slut shaming her\nBecause ah yeah and he actually put it on the cover literally ... radio talk show host go slut shaming at one spark\nAnd that was not my intention I just mentioned the fact that in forty years\nShe's not going to be so proud to have now a a octogenarian Mona Lisa on her back\nA and the amount of money that would require you know just a little tiny tattoo\nHaving removed just four or five thousand dollars a magic ... cars that are involved with removing an entire back print or a sleeve now women are getting full sleep and and I've noticed that women in law enforcement\nMore than than any other trade that I've seen women in law enforcement are now getting full sleeves and\nYou know it's come up in years past I knew some business owners that were hiring people for receptionist positions and things of that nature and would completely discount candidates\nThan women yeah they were all new agents that right because of women with full sleeve tattoos and I'm I'm seeing folks getting the neck tattoos and things of that nature and you know I understand it\nEvery tattoo has a story\nBut you know some stories don't need to be told in public and and ... you know that's that's just think about what you want to be when you grow up\nAnd decide whether or not that tattoo of Elmer flood saying I think I saw that there's going to fit in with you being a Supreme Court justice and [laughter] you know it might not be the best thing to do\nUm but anyway we talked about we were talking about women in society and taking a more active role and dissemination\nOf men and women have by their very nature and also by rulings of the court ... an rulings society women have been successful in a mass killing men and and to the point to where it has changed man's role in society\nUm and not for the better and and you still have there are there are certain jobs that run better when they're run by men regardless of whether or not you say\nYou know well women are just one chromosome away from\nBeing a man and we can do anything man can do you know what you're absolutely right there's only one job and his entire world that men can't do that women can do and that is half out over\nThe care well ... ... and a man who had a child and\nHe ... he was a man he ...\nHe was ... and it's not a man I got out of that and I'm just trying to make the point that in London they were letting him said that he wasn't a woman that they had a little that you had to put down that you were a woman if you had a baby\nAnd and so now they had a big hoopla but see now you have ... you\nKnow it was a woman who was transitioning to a man ... okay so it was only a woman yeah anecdotally they just like that all of these other trans out here that say they're trends look you can be trans whatever you want you can be\nTrans Siberian orchestra for all I care but you're still born with the chromosome that makes you a male or female\nAnd that's all you know ... whatever you want to chop off or you can open up whatever you want to open up but you're still a male DNA speaking and until they can suck all that DNA out of your body and replace it\nWith some other gender DNA you're still either a male or female and the fact that we are accepting these people\nOpenly in our society without claiming that they're outright nut jobs is bringing down our society as a whole transgender isn't is a mental disorder\nAnd has traditionally been a mental disorder and he still is that when we start to influence the used with thoughts right that\nOh well Suzie says she doesn't feel like the girl she wants to be a boy or ... says he wants to be ... you know and then you start to have well one of ... and so now everybody else wants to do it and you get a bunch of kids who are very confused\nAt times of life that are just confusing to

know how divided they are a ... even when someone does a\nThings as horrific as gruesome as this man did if it somehow falls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this

such an important story a and I know it's opening up all across America as we speak I Want to make sure that people understand that sometimes we have an obligation\nTo see what is happening in our name this is happening in America are there are other God's nails out there who have not yet been exposed and I think people and especially young people need\nTo see this in World War two when we defeated the Nazis one thing that the u._s. troops did us I'm a military leaders\nAre forced the local populations to come into the death camps and to see what had been done in their name they force them to see it so that they couldn't say I didn't know\nOr they would be forced to know now in this country we can't force people to watch this movie but I Want to say folks um if you're a parent a you really fought to bring 'em your teenagers to see what is happening in America says they can't say oh I don't know we need to understand\nWhat is happening in this movie does is as good a job as as anything\nOut there in showing what has been happening is absolutely horrifying and uh I I Want us to congratulations to both of you for persisting\nWith this because this is this is a big thing to write a book like this to do the research and I and I know and because we spoke on this program before it's heartbreaking for you or when you when you encountered\nThe horrors I did tell my audience for those who haven't heard you on this program before what it was a that led you to tell this story\nYou know at the very center I I it's interesting that you mentioned the Holocaust actually because I often say to people that you know with the abortion story you know sixty million plus children that have died in America it's very hard for people to kind of get their heads around left\nAnd in some ways I think of our film in some way we do a little bit of what Steven Spielberg in Schindler's List\nYou know you're a member of that they had to set the attend to kind of washed out ... and ... colored strand except for this long parts I think that that keep two two parts of colors I think that's flowers as well but it's a little girl wearing a red coat and you see her being labs\nBy the officer and then ... even if he got caught one floor and that's in a in a mass grave and I think by ... by ... by going into the very very detailed on life that was lost\nAnd the film does this go some way to do the same thing because at the center of of the movie is the story about one trying to update their baby boy who was called ... and who you know audiences gets ... and know about\nYou know God's little joked about him and all of that um but he got in work life because two of the staff\nTaking photographs of ... and ... you know from you ask me personally that may be shared with my father was born on July the twelve\nAnd you know I my mother used to talk about the hand of God but I Do think it's kind of extraordinary and all the ... year at the top of the birthday of fifth child who for an end date on the same day up to the workers took a photograph of him and their testimony during the trial and interviewed subsequently\nYou know words are very life changing I Would say I mean a lot with one of the people who took a photograph with asked I asked her I said to her you know and I thought it must be awful to get arrested you know and she said I wasn't arrest chips with rescue\nAnd and she was asked also you know why it she taking a photograph way to do that or did you take a photograph open and you know and she said I thought he could have had a chance he was so big I thought he could have had a chance to get it how how anyone could listen to test in the past\nI thought he could have had a chance to get it how how anyone could listen to testing they passed that was given to under oath and by someone standing who had watched this child live and try to breathe and try to you know try to survive\nAnd he struggled anymore or the other person who took a photograph of cream across described she was asked I mean you know that the idea that this wasn't newsworthy by the way beyond me but she was actually a cream across about to stand up and show the jury how to pay the moved how it moved\nAnd how it actually ... itself up to try to protect themselves because because at that age you with a little people like that who are like seven seven lung singer station age you know he you know he'd be cold and the lights would be very harsh\nAnd he had made the movement and she was asked if she stood up and made that much I mean it it you know that the only thing that you could possibly come to compare this to is the Holocaust and people do need to know\n'em and I ended his personal let it becomes partial when you you know can we you know we'll work on the book for a long time we know you know the details of everyone who gave testimony to the life of this child um and even his mother actually who spoke up a trial\nAnd I think the film will go a long way to ... his life and I Salem says a really wonderful thing actually about ...\nBut you know I'm not a person can live a really long life that you could live to be a big age never do anything significant in your life what is China already done something significant to even though he lived a very short time kids literally melted heart unchanged hearts that changed hard heart\nI told the story of baby boy in Erie, Pennsylvania where a woman who brought her teenage child who was pro choice and very hard hardships\nAnd who changed changed from Jeff knowing the baby and they're going to lie for baby boy it because at the center of it he was murdered but he could totally that she's in the late ... if he had been killed in one\nSo I'm\nYou know stories like that and that we that we tell and in the film that I think are are significant and and the reason why we did as\nWell I have to say that um you know the the two of you have done tremendous a journalism in in telling there's this larger story\nUh but I have I'm friends with Mollie Hemingway and with ... powers both of whom I remember advocating very strongly on Twitter that mainstream media covered this now these are two women\nUh who believe in the sanctity of the unborn or because of their Christian faith\nUm at one is politically liberal one is politically conservative but they both pushed and pushed\nAnd I I I Want to remind people that your voice counts you have to speak up and I want to say the pastors\nWho are listening or parents do you need to bring youth groups to to this I don't know what age would be appropriate but it seems to me that teenagers need to understand\nWhat is happening in America what has happened and what the mainstream media because they are in bed with the abortion industry they sweep it under the rug it is this scandal of our time we we're very happy to talk about scandals of the past\nThis is the scandal\nOf our time and I think we're going to look back on this and we're going to be horrified and we're going to wonder why didn't we do something well I guess I Want to say to my listeners see the movie tell your friends about the movie you can go to ... movie dot com and do we know how many theaters this is a opening in in in Salem\nIt's about seven hundred of 'em I'm across across the nation and I mean I Would say to people\nWhen they um when they

just sort of ... festival making the movie the mainstream media\nOn just as we were successful you know in in in telling and just as a citizen journalist like Mollie Hemingway\nCursing bars where she

the journalists ...\nWell we all know the name just go ahead sorry\nOn just on the point you had mentioned there Eric actually you know we got a PG Thirteen raising that still and I would say you know with ... those people can bring very young teenagers of all it just to see this film because\nUm you know day to day it's very important that they see it's um um because they're they're they're the ones that are that matter most to that story and so don't don't hesitate to bring to bring you know I'm a young teenager to us and the only thing people can do is go go to Godzilla movie dot com if

are the band aid by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the idea just it prior to that sort of sixteen reached out to states and if I'm offered this scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply was scanned the Internet facing systems so these are they um the server is like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line da

their level\nAnd it will tell the states where it sounds a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a weekly basis to see when the um the customer has has patched up to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two thousand six too much and then they've done that to more states more counties now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system could not getting at the core back and systems they're supposedly not connected to the Internet so it's not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nThat's often not touching um water the election
