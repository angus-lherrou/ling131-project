radio host spears out there regarding illegal everybody anxious pitcher that every single legal alien they don't\n... to ... what do you call to try and America\nClimbs on America or these corporate companies which are thousands thousands of them are just Monsanto do have all these illegal aliens are ready to come walk for months at a low wages\nI I'm not disputing that I'm not out to let me let me say this real quick let's go back something you said the beginning and then and then we'll continue on on your your your turn it on your own thing I don't act like all legal immigrants are are coming here to break laws I Know they are\nOkay\nEvery moment and we're still with facts not emotions okay is it a fact that if you come into the country illegally every moment of every day whether you're sleeping working whatever it may be that you are breaking the laws of the United states of America\nAre you going to do this\nBut I went on even when they get Michael Michael it's a simple questions on a trick question you called me okay I I didn't call you the idea that you knew you were going to say that again answer my question you act like it is um some how ridiculous that\nI say that every illegal immigrant is a law breaker that is their intent to break American law that's when they break into this country and they don't solve the paperwork and tried to come in this country is an actual legal migrants which I have no problem with you try to act like the the breaking of the law is\nNot breaking the law so you say well I Know all you all you talk show host you act like these people were all wall breakers\nThey actually are Michael I'm not saying they all have the intent to ... to rape or to murder I Do think they all have they intend to steal cars they're stealing from America when they come in this country legally they're stealing from the American worker they're stealing jobs they're not paying taxes the right way many\nOf them under cut jobs and make money in cash and the number one stimulant Mexico's economy is illegal immigrants who take the money and send it back to Mexico so to act as if the action of breaking into a country is it means that you're not a lawbreaker ... is absolute auditor insanity\nSo I'll start back with a question you ... you said that all you talk show host act like these people are breakers I'm not I I'm not the one that made the all the law is the law Michael the law says you cannot come into this country illegally\nBy that definition they are all breaking the law when they're here the entire time there he\nLaw that says the companies lied on fast though and it's legal for them to hire illegal alien\nI'm In favor of e verify I'm In favor also of going after those that hire illegals I've said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them all you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants\nCars equipment on job sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally\nI agree with you we have a problem with hiring illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem is that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at propaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people\nLike they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that is propaganda starting\nFortune of all with all these companies that hire really loyalists outcome start\nSo let me get a straight Michael why can't we start enforcing the law the way the president wants to do which is start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you still get hit out\nWhy people like that but when it comes to federal federal level all these other constituents there you know the politicians honey how big is Monsanto\nI I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employer there's there's there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving it a low number here\nThere are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying let's focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America then employ illegal immigrant labor labor\nBy agree it's a problem but if you cut off\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant Les ... immigrant labor then that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you know it's a two part solution I Am in favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people coming here border right now\nThe president's job and and they're broadcasting it live on social media\nThey're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying we don't care about your laws and were coming into your country and we're going to work in your country and we're going to undercut your wages and we're going to hurt the American worker and there's nothing you can do to stop us and this is how arrogant we are screw you America\nThat is the president's job\nTo make sure that those people are in handcuffs if they cross our border and immediately sent home\nAs far as far as that a news story or whatever it is a milestone now is that was rehearsed I Would say I want to go as far as saying that the Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michael I this is all propaganda for them in terms this is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love it\nThis is all propaganda for the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically get pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor a ... if you were trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that an suppose he really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law and not be able to abide by the wall\nAnd then she threatens people when you get in her weight just like she did this week\nDonald Trump without a minute by minute ago hey down on it you know remember when they threw a big party at the White House\nAnd this is coming from Nancy Pelosi celebrating them passing\nTheir bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give it legal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately needs them to be able to vote\nThat is what this is actually about the Democrats are terrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did they say character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\n\nWe had a big when we think are Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting\nAnd they woke up a bunch of you and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost the Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction\nIt's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats are terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house the Senate and they need new voters in this country 'cause they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want to I mean Hillary Clinton lost the Donald Trump you don't think\nThey're freaking out right now and they need new voters and the way to do is get illegals in here and given manage to amnesty and then they know they can win every national election\n\nWill get what bet to the fake Hispanic guy who wasn't even allowed to join the Hispanic caucus I mean
